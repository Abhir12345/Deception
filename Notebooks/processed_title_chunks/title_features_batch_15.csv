police officers face backlash after what they did to hillary in photo,"share this a photo of hillary clinton with some police officers popped up on social media over the weekend, but people were divided in their reaction to it. the post on the facebook page for the medford police patrolmen’s association caused controversy and backlash online over the content and what the was seen being done to crooked hillary. the post showed medford police officers at the fall festival in haines square on saturday. the photo was done in fun and captioned, “look who mpd grabbed at the fall festival in haines square today…” this image is an accurate depiction of what we all would like to see: hillary in handcuffs. as you can plainly see, the photos show police officers with a woman in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffed. it appears that they are arresting someone, who wore a mask in the likeness of hillary clinton. screenshot from the medford police patrolman’s facebook page in a second photo, the police officers posed with a person in a donald trump mask, with the caption, “making america great again in west medford square!!” screenshot from the medford police patrolman’s facebook page since a fair amount of overly sensitive pansies made a big deal about the posts, harry macgilvray, president of the medford police patrolmen’s association, decided to apologize for making the post. “these were halloween costumes. it was meant totally as a joke. i apologize if this offended anyone in any way,” macgilvray said in a statement. “i never expected this sort of reaction. it was poor judgment on my part.” the posts have been removed to avoid hurting the feelings of overly-sensitive liberals. while most of us see the humor in these images and understand how insane it was to apologize for the posts that were clearly done in jest, liberals don’t see things this way. they go out of their way, looking to be offended. if the police posed with a handcuffed trump, it’s pretty obvious that there would have been no outrage, because conservatives aren’t easily offended by free speech. however, a liberals sole purpose seems to be finding things to be offended over, and they have done it again.",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.08333333333333333,8.756666666666668,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0

u.s. intel report identifies russians who gave emails to wikileaks -officials,"washington (reuters) - the cia has identified russian officials who fed material hacked from the democratic national committee and party leaders to wikileaks at the direction of russian president vladimir putin through third parties, according to a new u.s. intelligence report, senior u.s. officials said on thursday. the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the central intelligence agency and others have concluded that the russian government escalated its efforts from discrediting the u.s. election process to assisting president-elect donald trump’s campaign. the intelligence assessment was presented to president barack obama on thursday and will be briefed to trump on friday. trump has rejected the broad intelligence community’s assessment that russia staged cyber attacks during the election campaign to undermine democratic rival hillary clinton. russia has rejected the hacking allegations. more from reuters* trump says u.s. funds spent on border wall would be repaid by mexico* schumer emerges as trump's newest punching bag* beheading attire and sexy suicide vests? satire of isis wives stirs anger and praise “by october, it had become clear that the russians were trying to help the trump campaign,” said one official familiar with the full report speaking on the condition of anonymity because the complete version is top secret. in some cases, one official said, the material followed what was called “a circuitous route” from the gru, russia’s military intelligence agency, to wikileaks in an apparent attempt to make the origins of the material harder to trace, a common practice used by all intelligence agencies, including u.s. ones. these handoffs, the officials said, enabled wikileaks founder julian assange to say the russian government or state agencies were not the source of the material published on his website. in an interview with fox news this week, assange said he did not receive emails stolen from the dnc and clinton aide john podesta from “a state party.” assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. details of the report emerged as the top u.s. intelligence official, james clapper, said on thursday he was “even more resolute” in his belief that russia staged cyber attacks on democrats during the 2016 election campaign. not all 17 intelligence agencies participated in preparing the assessment. an unclassified version of the report is expected to be released on friday morning, two officials said. the report contains some of what the officials called “minor footnotes” about open questions and other uncertainties, in part because some of the evidence supporting the conclusion is inferential. one such example, the officials said, was that intercepted messages and conversations among senior russian officials in putin’s inner circle indicated they were aware of the hacking campaign and celebrated trump’s election as a victorious end to the campaign. the officials declined to discuss the nature of the communications, including whether they were domestic, international, or both. “people who knew what this was about were celebrating a victory over the united states,” said one official. another example of inferential evidence, the officials said, was that as time passed and the early leaks attracted media attention that undermined or eclipsed clinton’s campaign, the russians increasingly focused their hacking “almost exclusively” on democratic rather than republican targets. there was also strong resemblance — including the use of the same computer malware — the russians have used against targets in europe and the marriage of traditional espionage tactics used by soviet and russian intelligence such as bribery, blackmail and internet vulnerabilities, which they said putin has devoted increasing resources and attention to exploiting. for example, one official said, the democratic databases and email servers the russians hacked also contained personal information that wikileaks has not published. such information could be used to search for financial, medical, browsing history and other records that can be used to target individuals for recruiting efforts by russian spies.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.22727272727273,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
south sudan opposition groups meet in kenya to 'harmonize voices',"kampala (reuters) - south sudanese opposition groups tried to forge a united front on monday ahead of an expected resumption of peace talks, in the first such meeting since the start of their country s civil war nearly four years ago, attendees told reuters. south sudan s civil war, triggered by a feud between president salva kiir and his former deputy, has plunged parts of the world s youngest nation into famine and forced a third of the population - some four million people - to flee their homes. representatives of south sudan s many armed and unarmed opposition groups met in the kenyan town of nyahururu, said kosti manibe, a former government minister who was briefly jailed and represents a group of ex-political prisoners. i call it like-minded groups who are opposed to the policy that the regime of salva in (south sudan s capital) juba is pursuing, manibe said. the gathering, expected to last three days, comes after diplomats from the regional bloc igad held talks with kiir in juba at the weekend to press the government to participate in the planned peace talks in december. the opposition is speaking in a cacophony of voices. there is a need to harmonize these voices, said majak d agoot, another member of the former prisoner group. manibe said kenya s government had graciously allowed the opposition groups to meet in their country, without elaborating. kenyan foreign affairs ministry spokesman edwin limo said he was not aware of the meeting. the united nations says south sudan s civil war has resulted in ethnic cleansing and other war crimes. a western-backed peace deal between kiir and his former deputy riek machar collapsed last year, spawning the creation of new armed and political groups opposing the government. machar s spla-io rebel group, the country s largest which still controls swathes of territory in the south and northeast of south sudan, declined to attend the nyahururu meeting, according to nathaniel oyet, a senior member of the group, saying it may distract from the december talks. oyet also cited security concerns in kenya where spla-io officials have disappeared in the last year, including machar s spokesman who was arrested and deported to juba in 2016. among those attending monday s meeting in kenya were representatives of former army general thomas cirillo, who is waging an insurgency in the southern region of south sudan, and other former government officials lam akol, gabriel changson, and joseph bakosoro, all of whom live in exile. south sudanese government officials were unavailable for comment on the kenya meeting.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.55,12.0,0.0,0.0

"facing crime wave, residents in south sudan capital pay police for protection","juba (reuters) - residents of south sudan s capital say they are collecting cash to pay police unofficially to patrol their neighborhoods, amid a crime wave and a cash crunch that means authorities often cannot pay their wages. robbers killed more than 60 people last month in juba, twice as many as in july, according to the community empowerment of progress organisation, a civil society organization in juba that tallies violent incidents. in one incident this month, around 50 gunmen in army uniforms attacked homes. armed residents repulsed them and there were no known casualties, the organization said. it was unclear whether the attackers were members of the security forces. edmund yakani, head of the progress organisation, said security was improving in some areas since communities began collecting cash to pay for police patrols. south sudan s nearly four-year-old civil war has slashed oil production and the cash-strapped government struggles to pay security forces. it has asked foreign donors for help, but the request is unlikely to be granted since rights groups accuse security forces of torturing, raping and killing civilians. the war has displaced a third of the east african nation s 12 million people and spilt into neighboring states. at a community meeting last week in the juba neighborhood of kator east, dozens of residents each agreed to give 100 south sudanese pounds (just under $1) to hire police to join youth volunteers in patrolling, said lucy ramada, 38. every household was asked to contribute ... for the payment of extra police personnel that will assist our youth at night, she said. since the patrols began with the paid police, she added, there is no sound of gunfire and no robberies . police spokesman daniel boulogne said he was unaware of residents offering police extra pay. a south sudanese police officer is paid about 1,500 south sudanese pounds on average, about $83 at the current exchange rate. we have not asked for any (extra) incentives because it is our duty to do our best to give them security, he said. he did not comment on police wages. monthly inflation has reached triple digits, and the scramble for food forces many people into crime, said james okuk, a lecturer at juba university. the situation is forcing people to become robbers, he said. the situation has been made worse by the government not paying salaries to its employees, including those carrying guns, for some months. defence minister kuol manyang juuk told reuters that some members of the army and police were under investigation for robbery but the number was small.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.740000000000002,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0

planned parenthood protests aimed at house republicans' offices,"(reuters) - planned parenthood, the u.s. medical services provider that could lose federal funding under the republican-controlled house of representatives’ healthcare overhaul bill, said it would hold dozens of demonstrations outside the local offices of members of congress across the country on friday and saturday. the protests will target some of the 217 republican representatives who voted to pass legislation on thursday that would repeal and replace the affordable care act, or obamacare, the healthcare law passed in 2010 under former president barack obama. “we’re standing together as women, people of color, immigrants, and as people of faith, and we’re fighting back to make sure that every single politician in america knows that we will not stand for ‘defunding’ planned parenthood,” kelly robinson, the national organizing director of the planned parenthood action fund, said in a statement. the bill still needs approval by the u.s. senate. president donald trump, a republican, praised the bill’s passage in the house but acknowledged that some of its provisions may change before it becomes law. a part of the republicans’ proposed american health care act would prevent planned parenthood from being reimbursed for any of its services, including cancer screening and pre-natal care, through the medicaid program for the poor. about 60 percent of the patients who use planned parenthood’s 600 or so clinics are on medicaid or other federal public health programs. republican congressional offices from coast to coast were targeted on friday, with protests planned at the offices of representatives rodney frelinghuysen in morristown, new jersey, kevin yoderice in shawnee mission, kansas, and darrell issa in vista, california, among others. many republicans oppose any funding for planned parenthood, citing religious grounds, because its services include abortions, although it receives no federal funding or reimbursement for abortions, as stipulated by federal law. the family research council, a christian advocacy group, and other conservative policy groups praised the house bill as a tool to help limit access to abortions. planned parenthood says the bill would harm 2.5 million people who rely on it for basic health services.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.130000000000003,18.2,0.0,0.0
s&p ratchets up pressure on alaska over budget,"(reuters) - s&p global ratings warned on thursday that the credit rating for key alaska bonds could go down if lawmakers fail to agree on a budget that addresses the state’s long term-fiscal problems. alaska governor bill walker convened a special session of the legislature late last month aimed at passing a budget for fiscal 2017 and closing the state’s nearly $4 billion deficit, which has been driven by a collapse in global oil prices. s&p on thursday put the state’s aa-plus general obligation, aa appropriation, and a-plus moral obligation ratings on alaska’s debt on creditwatch with negative implications. the bond proceeds are expected to pay for several transportation-related projects. “the creditwatch placement indicates that we may lower alaska’s credit rating if state policymakers defer adopting fiscal reforms to correct the state’s structural budget deficit,” said gabriel petek, a s&p global ratings credit analyst. since the special session began late last month the legislature has passed a $4.4 billion spending plan for fiscal 2017 and a bill to reduce the cost of the state’s oil and gas tax credit program, s&p said. but it is unclear if a hotly contested bill that would transfer money from the state’s permanent fund to its general fund will overcome opposition in the state house of representatives. the bill, sb 128, would reduce the amount paid out to residents annually from the fund. even if it passes, s&p said it remains to be seen whether sb 128 and other fiscal reforms would be sufficient to put alaska’s fiscal structure on a sustainable trajectory. “enactment of sb 128 alone would shrink the deficit, but it wouldn’t eliminate it. in order to fully close the structural fiscal gap, other measures – such as new income tax or more spending cuts – would also be necessary,” s&p said. despite the budget deficit, s&p said alaska continues to have very strong credit quality due to the large reserves it built up over times when oil prices were high.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.180000000000003,8.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
trump campaign manager manafort offered to brief russian billionaire during 2016 race: washington post,"washington (reuters) - paul manafort, president donald trump’s former campaign manager, offered to provide briefings to a russian billionaire with close ties to the kremlin on the status of the 2016 u.s. presidential election less than two weeks before trump accepted the republican nomination, the washington post reported on wednesday. “if he needs private briefings we can accommodate,” manafort wrote in an email to an overseas intermediary between him and aluminum magnate oleg deripaska, the post reported, citing people familiar with the discussions. the post said portions of the july 7, 2016, email were read to it, as were other parts of manafort’s correspondence. the email was one of tens of thousands of documents turned over to special counsel robert mueller, the post reported, who along with several congressional committees is investigating alleged russian efforts to tip the 2016 election in trump’s favor and whether any members of trump’s campaign colluded with moscow’s effort. mueller’s office declined to comment on the post story. manafort spokesman jason maloni told reuters the emails were an attempt by manafort to collect unpaid debts. maloni told the post that no briefings took place. the post said there was no evidence deripaska ever received manafort’s alleged offer or that any briefings took place. a spokesman for deripaska told the paper the emails were scheming by “consultants in the notorious ‘beltway bandit’ industry.” russia has denied it interfered in the u.s. election, and trump has said there was no collusion with his campaign.",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.784285714285716,14.171428571428573,0.0,0.0
court throws out $655.5 million terrorism verdict against palestinian groups - the new york times,"a federal appeals court in new york has thrown out a $655. 5 million verdict rendered last year that had held the palestinian authority and the palestine liberation organization liable for their roles in supporting terrorist attacks in israel that claimed american lives. in reversing the verdict on wednesday in the case, which drew the attention of the obama administration, the appeals court did not minimize the impact of the six terrorist attacks, which occurred from 2002 to 2004, but it held that the federal district court in manhattan had lacked the jurisdiction to hear the case. “the terror attacks and suicide bombings that triggered this suit and victimized these plaintiffs were unquestionably horrific,” said a panel of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit, in manhattan. “but the federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits prescribed by the due process clause of the constitution,” the court added, “no matter how horrendous the underlying attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs’ claims. ” the plaintiffs included 10 families, comprising about three dozen people, eight of whom were physically injured in the attacks, as well as the estates of several victims who were killed. the suit was brought under the act, which provided for the tripling of the $218. 5 million in damages awarded by a manhattan jury. the law, which allows united states citizens who are the victims of international terrorism to sue in the federal courts, was passed some years after the 1985 murder of leon klinghoffer in the palestinian hijacking of the cruise ship achille lauro. kent a. yalowitz, a lawyer for the families in the case, said in a statement that the law had been passed by congress “to protect americans wherever in the world they traveled. ” “the very terrorists who prompted the law have now hidden behind the u. s. constitution to avoid responsibility for their crimes,” mr. yalowitz said. “this cruel decision must be corrected so that these families may receive justice. ” mr. yalowitz said the plaintiffs were weighing their options, which could include seeking review by the full appeals court, or asking the united states supreme court to hear the case. the attacks in israel occurred on the street, at a crowded bus stop and inside a bus, and in a cafeteria on the hebrew university campus. hanan ashrawi, a member of the p. l. o. ’s executive committee who testified for the defense in the trial, expressed satisfaction with the appeals court’s decision, saying, “i hope this is the end of it. ” speaking by telephone from ramallah in the west bank, ms. ashrawi said, “finally the american justice system proved its impartiality. ” she added that the decision “restores my faith in the judicial system. ” the jury in the trial, which ended in february 2015, heard emotional testimony from victims and witnesses in the attacks. but in finding that the federal court lacked jurisdiction, the appellate panel ruled that the connections between the palestinian defendants and the united states were not sufficient to give the trial court the power to hear the plaintiffs’ claims. judge john g. koeltl, writing for the panel, said the attacks in israel had not been “expressly aimed at the united states,” and evidence presented by the plaintiffs had established the attacks’ “random and fortuitous nature. ” “evidence at trial showed that the shooters fired ‘indiscriminately,’” the judge wrote, “and chose sites for their suicide bomb attacks that were ‘full of people,’ because they sought to kill ‘as many people as possible. ’” the decision was joined by judges pierre n. leval and christopher f. droney. the trial judge, george b. daniels, had required the palestinian authority to post a bond of $10 million and an additional $1 million monthly to appeal the case. the bond is typically 111 percent of the judgment, but the authority said it could not afford that. lawyers for the victims had objected to the lower amount, but the authority won support from an unexpected source: the obama administration. officials at the justice and state departments had asked judge daniels to consider the ramifications of requiring too high a bond, suggesting that doing so could cause economic and political harm to the palestinian authority and the broader peace process. “a p. a. insolvency and collapse would harm current and future u. s. efforts to achieve a solution to the conflict,” antony j. blinken, the deputy secretary of state, said in a court filing in august 2015. the government’s filing came after sharp debate between officials at the state and justice departments over the strategy to take in the case.",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.368571428571428,8.514285714285714,0.0,0.0

[the late milton friedman in his book the tyranny of the status quo noted that “a new administration has some six to nine months in which to achieve major changes if it does not seize the opportunity to act decisively during that period, it will not have another such opportunity. further changes come slowly or not at all, and counterattacks develop against the initial changes. the temporarily routed political forces regroup, and they tend to mobilize everyone who was adversely affected by the changes, while the proponents of the changes tend to relax after their initial victories. ” from franklin roosevelt’s accomplishments during his first hundred days to ronald reagan’s economic recovery act, the signature legislative achievements of presidential administrations generally conform to friedman’s axiom. rahm emanuel’s “you never want a serious crisis to go to waste” axiom proves an exception to this rule. assassination attempts, wars, and other unforeseen events allow presidents to steamroll their legislation through congress. a second exception involves legislation that receives bipartisan support. reagan’s tax reform act of 1986, which represented a larger cut than his initial reduction, received support from such democrats as senator bill bradley and dick gephardt. bill clinton’s reluctant welfare reform, one of the more significant legislative achievements of his presidency, similarly received support from important figures in the opposition party, notably speaker newt gingrich, as most members from his own democratic party voted “no. ” given the partisan rancor surrounding obamacare, foreseeing a scenario where the parties get together to repeal and replace seems the stuff of fantasy. and the idea of a crisis erupting that leads to repeal appears equally . so, either the republicans regroup to unite to get this done now or look forward to a future in which obamacare becomes as much as an untouchable third rail as medicare or social security. for the side, “don’t make the perfect the enemy of the good” comes to mind as the strongest argument. instead of americans get obamacare because of the recalcitrance of conservative members of congress. the people want their republican colleagues to act like they control the house, senate, and the presidency instead of capitulating to the people who no longer control the house, senate, and presidency as they did when obamacare passed. why settle for a status quo when they could get the status quo ante? seven years ago, all republicans opposed obamacare. now in the majority, can’t they whip up 90 percent of their caucus in the house to repeal it? prospects for republicans fulfilling their promise to the american people now look bleak. and conservatives, once again, find themselves conserving liberal laws. “we’re going to be living with obamacare for the foreseeable future,” predicted paul ryan after his bill went down in flames before it even received a vote. congressman michael burgess bluntly explained, “we’re done with this. ” deflated republican voters may similarly find themselves done with their representatives on the hill. the gop enjoyed a floating pitch down the middle of the plate. they whiffed. such golden opportunities rarely present themselves. that’s the tyranny of the status quo.",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.62714285714286,17.02857142857143,0.0,0.0
breaking: the first charges have been filed in mueller’s russia investigation,"special counsel robert mueller appears to have turned something up in his investigation into the trump-russia scandal. the first official charges have been filed according to cnn, and someone may well be taken into custody in just a few days. while the house and senate seem to be throwing in the towel on their investigations, and republicans including trump himself are ramping up their calls for investigations into hillary and uranium one, mueller is still doing his job.cnn has an exclusive story on this. the charges are currently sealed by order of a federal judge, and mueller s office would not comment. however, they say: plans were prepared friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as monday, the sources said. it is unclear what the charges are. mueller was appointed special counsel shortly after trump fired fbi director james comey. the original investigation was into whether trump obstructed justice in firing comey, but lately, he and his team have been interviewing everyone from paul manafort to michael flynn both of whom have known ties to russia and pro-russia groups.mueller s office has also been looking into a meeting between don trump jr., jared kushner, paul manafort and a russian attorney who claimed to have damaging information about hillary clinton. don jr. even said he loved it when he said he d take the meeting. he promptly lied about it, saying it was about adoptions, and then released emails proving he lied.since it s not clear what the charges are or who they re against, there are all sorts of possibilities. the dominoes clearly are starting to fall, and trump s increasingly loud focus on hillary and democrats shows that he s running ever more frightened.featured image via media library",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0
"the horrifying reality of executions in this state has been uncovered, but it’s unlikely to stop","according to reuters, a grand jury in oklahoma found that jail staff did not verify what drugs they were using for lethal injections and were unaware when the wrong drugs were administered. this report is another damning piece of evidence that shows that there are many flaws in the supposedly humane systems in place for carrying out capital punishments.in 2014, the news broke that the execution of an inmate named clayton lockett, who was sentenced to death for murder. an executioner failed to properly put an i.v. line into lockett. the needle used to inject the lethal drugs into lockett began to spray all over the execution chamber that he was in. he died, after 45 minutes of agony. not because the toxins that were pumped into his body worked as intended, but because they caused lockett to die of a heart attack.after, a massive outcry from the public, which included a scathing condemnation from amnesty international, oklahoma made some minor changes to their policies regarding executions. in 2015, two more botched executions were performed. one of those executed was charles werner. his final words were my body is on fire. one of the major factors contributing to these botched executions is due to the absence of sodium thiopental, which is the executioner s drug of choice for lethal injections in the u.s. the drug was taken off from the market in 2011 due to increasing international regulations on lethal injections. states who have yet to abolish capital punishment, have been scrambling to find alternatives.that means, once again in its history, the u.s. is desperately clinging to a practice that the rest of the world is moving towards abolishing. there are many good reasons for abolishing the death penalty but there is one reason in particular that even the staunchest advocates of the deathly penalty must admit is terrifying. a recent study found that 1 in 25 prisoners who are sentenced to death are actually innocent.no matter what protocols are put in place, we can never know for sure if they are truly innocent. i share the same stance as many capital punishment abolitionists, that capital punishment is always wrong, no matter what, whether the convicted individual is guilty or innocent. the idea that innocent people might be subjected to what is increasingly becoming not only a death sentence but a sentence to living their final moments in a state of hell ( my body is on fire ) is unconscionable.oklahoma, you have already proven that reforming your policies on capital punishment are a facade. it s time to for you and the rest of the states that have yet to abolish the death penalty to give up this barbaric practice.right now, all executions are on hold in oklahoma. since then, not a single execution has been botched and not a single innocent person has been murdered by the state. it s sounds as if they have found the perfect solution to their problem now they just need to make it permanent.featured image from (photo by joe raedle/newsmakers)",1,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,12.037500000000005,18.900000000000002,0.0625,0.0
just in: criminal hackers who stole data from 500 million yahoo email users were russian agents obama regime invited to u.s…courted by fbi,"just two years ago, the obama white house welcomed russia s top internal security official, alexander bortnikov, to washington, as the head of a kremlin delegation attending a highly publicized u.s. government summit on countering violent extremism.obama was caught on an open mic telling russian president dmitry medvedev (on the left) who is pictured toasting with vladimir putin and head of the federal security service alexander bortnikov, that he would have more flexibility after his second term. of course, the mainstream media all but ignored the disturbing conversation. they re all over the fake news story however about trump and his alleged russian ties, of which they have absolutely no evidence. what u.s. officials did not then know is that officers of the agency that bortnikov heads, the fsb or federal security service, were at that moment directing an audacious state-sponsored cyberattack to penetrate yahoo s email network, deploying criminal hackers to steal data on 500 million email users, according to criminal charges unveiled by the justice department on wednesday. the indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in california charged two fsb officers and two civilians one russian and one from kazakhstan, now living in canada with crimes including computer hacking and economic espionage.the fsb sponsored cyberattack, which lasted from 2014 to last september, was described by government officials today as one of the largest data breaches in history: it involved the theft of vast amounts of credit card data and other financial information, as well as personal details on individuals of high interest to the russian government: journalists, u.s. officials and u.s. and foreign corporate executives and employees, including a senior officer of a major u.s. airline and even a nevada gaming official.but what was especially galling to u.s. officials is that the two fsb officers at the center of the plot, dmitry dokuchaev and igor sushchin, were assigned to the agency s center for information security, or center 18 a cybercrime unit that was the fbi s point of contact for investigating criminal hacking operations. what this shows is that we ve been had, said steve hall, a former cia station chief in moscow who later directed agency operations in russia. center 18 was the part of the fsb that was supposed to be working with us. but instead of working with the fbi and cia to catch hackers, the fsb officers were actually working with hackers themselves, according to the justice department charges. in the yahoo attack, two alleged cybercriminals were also charged as co-conspirators in the plot. one of them, alexsey belan, a notorious cyberthief who has been twice indicted in the united states and is on the fbi s cyber most wanted list, received sensitive law enforcement and intelligence information from the fsb that helped him avoid detection by the fbi and facilitated his theft of proprietary yahoo data including stealing the company s account management tool (amt), a system that yahoo used to make and log changes to user accounts. his purpose, a senior u.s. official said today, was to line his own pockets with money. for entire story: yahoo news",1,23,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.442826086956522,13.295652173913044,0.0,0.0

scientists find 19 pieces of non-human dna in the human genome,"according to a new study, eight percent of our dna is alien. in fact, it is made up of non-human, viral fragments. the new study was published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the recent study revealed that there is literally non-human dna residing in modern humans’ genome. this study comes after a froup of researchers from tufts and university of michigan medical school examined 2,500 people. experts discovered that our dna is less human and that nineteen pieces of ancient viral dna exist within our own genome. most strikingly, experts discovered the full genetic mockup for an entire virus within 2 percent of the people they examined. according to sciencedaily.com , whether or not the virus can be replicated or reproduced, isn’t yet known. but other studies of ancient virus dna have shown it can affect the humans who carry it. sciencedaily reports that the study offers new insight on human endogenous retroviruses. herv’s are actually antique diseases which possess eerily similar characteristics to human immunodeficiency virus, the precursor to aids. experts believe that this ‘viral dna0 has been passed down through thousands of generations of human beings. the study’s authors are still unsure whether the ancient strains of dna could cause infections. “this one looks like it is capable of making infectious virus, which would be very exciting if true, as it would allow us to study a viral epidemic that took place long ago,” says senior author and virologist john coffin, ph.d. of the tufts university school of medicine. “this research provides important information necessary for understanding how retroviruses and humans have evolved together in relatively recent times.” “many studies have tried to link these endogenous viral elements to cancer and other diseases, but a major difficulty has been that we haven’t actually found all of them yet,” says co-first author zachary h. williams, a ph.d. student at the sackler school of graduate biomedical sciences at tufts university in boston. “a lot of the most interesting elements are only found in a small percentage of people, which means you have to screen a large number of people to find them.” “this is a thrilling discovery,” says co-first author julia wildschutte, ph.d., who began the work as a ph.d. student in coffin’s lab at tufts. “it will open up many doors to research. what’s more, we have confirmed in this paper that we can use genomic data from multiple individuals compared to the reference human genome to detect new hervs. but this has also shown us that some people carry insertions that we can’t map back to the reference.” reference: http://www.pnas.org/content/113/16/e2326.full.pdf source: ewao",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.154545454545456,15.30909090909091,0.0,0.0
"rights advocates slam trump plans on muslim immigrants, refugees","new york (reuters) - immigrant and refugee advocates on wednesday denounced white house plans to temporarily stop receiving refugees and suspend visas for people from seven middle eastern and north african countries, saying they target muslims and will make america less safe. a draft executive order seen by reuters that trump is expected to sign in the coming days would block the entry of refugees from war-torn syria and suspend the entry of any immigrants from muslim-majority middle eastern and african countries syria, sudan, somalia, iraq, iran, libya and yemen while permanent rules are studied. trump is also expected to order a multi-month ban on allowing refugees into the united states except for religious minorities escaping persecution, until more aggressive vetting is in place, said the aides and experts, who asked not to be identified. the administration’s aim is to head off islamist violence in the united states, but critics say the measures soil america’s reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants of all kinds. “the president needs to know he’s an absolute fool for fostering this kind of hostility in his first few days. this will inflame violence against americans around the world,” said seth kaper-dale, a pastor at the reformed church of highland park, new jersey, which he said helped resettle 28 refugee and asylum-seeking families in the state last year. before his nov. 8 election victory, trump, a republican, pledged to stop taking refugees from syria and immigrants from countries deemed to pose a terrorism risk. “muslims, we believe, are the sole targets of these orders,” said nihad awad, executive director of the council on american-islamic relations, a muslim civil rights group. “these orders are a disturbing confirmation of islamophobic and un-american policy proposals made during the presidential election campaign,” awad told a news conference in washington. during the campaign, trump originally proposed a ban on all muslims entering the country, a measure that almost certainly would have faced legal challenges for discrimination on the basis of religion. he later altered his stance to target countries known to be sources of terrorism. about 100 protesters gathered in new york city’s washington square park chanting, “say it loud, say it clear, refugees are here to stay.” they also blasted the trump administration as “too male, too pale and too stale.” “we reject policies that turn their backs on those who have suffered,” u.s. representative nydia velazquez, a new york city democrat, shouted to protesters.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.89777777777778,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0
"trump gains on clinton, poll shows 'rigged' message resonates","newtown, pa./new york (reuters) - republican presidential candidate donald trump gained on his democratic rival hillary clinton among american voters this week, cutting her lead nearly in half, according to reuters/ipsos polling released on friday. the polling data showed trump’s argument that the nov. 8 election is “rigged” against him has resonated with members of his party. “remember folks, it’s a rigged system,” trump told a pennsylvania rally on friday. “that’s why you’ve got to get out and vote, you’ve got to watch. because this system is totally rigged.” clinton led trump 44 percent to 40 percent, according to the oct. 14-20 reuters/ipsos poll, a 4-point lead. that compared with 44 percent for clinton and 37 percent for trump in the oct. 7-13 poll released last week. an average of national opinion polls by realclearpolitics shows clinton 6.2 percentage points ahead at 48.1 percent support to trump’s 41.9 percent. trump is slated to give a speech saturday in gettysburg, pennsylvania, best known as the site of a decisive civil war battle and cemetery, and the place where republican president abraham lincoln delivered his famous address. aides told reporters on friday night that trump would make his closing argument to voters in his speech, and preview what he would do in his first 100 days in the white house. “i think this site is fitting in terms of understanding a positive vision for the republican party,” an aide said. trump’s campaign was thrown into crisis after a 2005 video released this month showed him bragging about groping and kissing women. he has since faced accusations - which he has said are “absolutely false” - that he made improper sexual advances to women over decades. the reuters/ipsos survey found 63 percent of americans, including a third of republicans, believe the new york real estate mogul has committed sexual assault in the past. reuters contacted a few of the poll respondents who said they felt that trump had likely “committed sexual assault” but were still supporting his candidacy. their answers were generally the same: whatever trump did with women in the past is less important to them than what he may do as president. at a trump rally in fletcher, north carolina, harold garren, 75, said he was skeptical of complaints from women about trump’s behavior. “i don’t believe all of this 30 years later, no,” garren said. garren also shrugged off trump’s lewd bragging about women, caught on the 2005 tape. “i’ve used that barnyard language myself,” garren said, clarifying that it was when he was younger and before he knew better. both candidates spent friday in battleground states, where the vote could swing either way. clinton, 68, campaigned in ohio, while trump, 70, was in north carolina and pennsylvania. trump, his voice lacking some of its usual energy in his third rally in one day, told voters in newtown, pennsylvania they had to vote or else he would have wasted a lot of “time, energy and money.” trump has been coy about whether he will accept the results of the election should clinton beat him. the reuters/ipsos data showed only half of republicans would accept clinton as their president, and nearly 70 percent of them said a clinton victory would be because of illegal voting or vote rigging. trump’s crowd chanted “lock her up!” at a rally in johnstown, pennsylvania after he declared clinton a “corrupt globalist,” a reference to campaign documents released by wikileaks in which clinton was quoted advocating free trade and open borders. after the chant went around the room for several seconds, trump responded, “don’t worry, that whole thing will be looked into.” the new york businessman’s assertion that the election is being rigged and his refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if he loses has challenged a cornerstone of american democracy and outraged democrats and many republicans. asked if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power during wednesday’s debate, trump replied: “what i’m saying is that i will tell you at the time. i’ll keep you in suspense. ok?” in ohio on friday, clinton called his refusal unprecedented. “now make no mistake: by doing that, he is threatening our democracy,” she told a rally in cleveland. “but we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right? and the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart,” clinton said. trump has offered no widely accepted evidence to back up his claims of vote-rigging. numerous studies have shown that the u.s. election system, which is run by the states, is sound. trump told an earlier rally in fletcher, north carolina, that he wanted to have no regrets about whether he worked hard enough to win the election, and urged followers to get out to vote. “win, lose or draw - and i’m almost sure if the people come out, we’re going to win - i will be happy with myself,” he said. “we have to work, we have to get everybody out there.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.964444444444446,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
billionaire ‘bilderberger’ david rockefeller dead at 101,"the trilateral commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the united states. the trilateral commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. senator barry goldwater, from his book with no apologies 21st century wire says controversial globalist and banker david rockefeller has died at 101 years of age.rockefeller has been described as a philanthropist and banker, yet much of his legacy will forever be tied to the creation of the well-known think-tank the council on foreign relations, the trilateral commission and his central role on the steering committee for the secretive bilderberg group established in 1954.the bilderberg group has often been passed off as an insignificant gathering of corporate ceo s, barons of oil, government top brass and royalty most mainstream outlets still continue to mask the group s influence on foreign policy and world finance but thankfully their exploits have been slowly uncovered with each passing year, as the list of attendees seem to change and grow with each new conference location.for those who still doubt there s a hidden element directing global interests, one only needs to look into the high-powered pursuits of bilderberg attendees that have been linked to creating a multi-national sovereignty override through many transnational corporations with world trade partnerships like the transatlantic partnership (ttip) and transpacific partnership (tpp), which now excludes the us via an executive order from donald trump.the following passage is from the ny times: he spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club, no matter what they did, the new york times columnist david brooks wrote in 2002, citing the profitable deals mr. rockefeller had cut with oil-rich dictators, soviet party bosses and chinese perpetrators of the cultural revolution. there was also an immense sphere of influence held by various power-hungry groups such as the trilateral commission, brought to fruition in 1973 by david rockefeller and perennial foreign policy advisor zbigniew brzezinski. the commission was also joined by fellow bilderberg attendee and longtime policy advisor henry kissinger. contrary to what most people think the vast majority of the trilateral commission s members have been from countries outside of america.rockefeller, like george soros, is ultimately tied to globalism and vast social engineering programs.more from rt below (photo illustration 21wire s shawn helton)billionaire banker david rockefeller dies aged 101rtrockefeller died in his sleep at home in pocantico hills, new york, on monday morning as a result of congestive heart failure, according to a family spokesperson fraser p. seitel.the businessman, who had an estimated fortune of $3 billion, retired as head of chase manhattan in 1981 after a 35-year career.in the statement from the the rockefeller foundation confirming his death, rockefeller was described as one of the most influential figures in the history of american philanthropy and finance, considered by many to be america s last great international business statesman . rockefeller, also known as the banker s banker , according to the statement, is said to have donated almost $2 billion over his lifetime to various institutions including rockefeller university, harvard university and art museum.david was the youngest of six children born to john d. rockefeller jr. and the grandson of standard oil co-founder john d. rockefeller.rockefeller graduated from harvard in 1936 and received a doctorate in economics from the university of chicago in 1940. appointed president of chase manhattan in 1961, he became chairman and ceo eight years later.rt continues here read more on social engineering: 21st century wire social engineering filessupport 21wire subscribe & become a member @21wire.tv",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.425714285714289,19.942857142857143,0.14285714285714285,0.0
milo: ’america has a problem with fake hate crimes’ - breitbart,"breitbart news senior editor milo declared that “america has a problem with fake hate crimes,” during his talk at the university of colorado colorado springs tonight, citing numerous news stories that turned out to be false.[ “the left didn’t learn anything from the beatdown they suffered on election night. in fact they are on their identity politics,” claimed milo. “conservatives aren’t just deplorables and racists, we’re ‘white nationalist hatemongers’. and white women and the working class who voted for trump are too. they’ve ramped up their fake news activities to prove how wrong we all are, and their top weapon is fake hate crimes. ” “america has a problem with fake hate crimes. the left is always searching for the next big outrage, and sometimes when the pressure gets too high, they just decide to make them up,” he continued. “that is basically how the uva rape fantasy that ran in rolling stone came about by the way. this trend has just accelerated since the election. fake attacks on muslim women seem to be in vogue right now. but it isn’t a new trend. i wrote an article in may 2016 that documented 100 fake hate crimes in the last decade. 100 of them! and surely there were more that just didn’t make it into the public eye. ” “i bring this up because colorado springs is part of the list. in 2015, threats were left outside of a predominantly black church referencing the kkk and a second one says ‘black men beware, you are the target’,” milo declared. “there’s just one problem … . this is the evil racist local police found behind the messages. ” in scooby doo unmasking fashion, milo displayed the image of the black perpetrator onto the projector. “woops, it’s a black guy!” he announced. “sadly, this is part of an increasing trend in the us towards sensational but untrue stories. fake hate crimes are the original fake news. ” “i mentioned the uva rape case, which was a complete fabrication happily carried by the leftist media. of course everyone with a brain knows that rape culture on campus is a myth,” he concluded. “1 in 4 women on campus will not be raped, and american universities are not more dangerous than african nations. ” “sorry about it. ” written from prepared remarks. milo wears glasses by givenchy, $350. distressed blue jeans by true religion, $329. brown leather belt with gold buckle by louis vuitton, $450. light pink dress shirt by brooks brothers, $92. sparkly purple suit jacket by angelino, $225. burgundy crushed velvet slippers by crockett jones, $370. socks by ralph lauren, 3 pairs for $21. 98. jewellery and pearls, too much money to count. charlie nash is a reporter for breitbart tech. you can follow him on twitter @mrnashington or like his page at facebook.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,8.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0
delegates for dummies: how they’re awarded…and how many your candidate needs to win [video],"stop counting the votes! your candidates nomination based strictly on the number of delegates they are able to obtain from each state following their elections.watch this great video explaining how hillary can receive less votes, but still win with super delegates:the nominating contests that will determine the democratic and republican nominees for the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election are about to enter a critical phase. on march 1, known as super tuesday, primaries or caucuses are being held in about a dozen states, and they could be turning points in both parties.but the key to winning the nomination for each party is ultimately not about the popular vote. it is about securing the number of delegates needed to win the nomination at each party s convention july 18-21 in cleveland for the republicans and july 25-28 in philadelphia for the democrats.like so many things in politics, there are twists and turns in how the popular vote is used to select each party s candidate.the following is a guide to the nominating process:q: is the delegate selection process the same for the republican and democratic parties?a: no. the parties set their own rules. one thing that is the same is that at each party convention, a candidate needs to reach only a simple majority of the delegate votes to win the nomination.q: how many delegates are there?a: the democratic convention will be attended by about 4,763 delegates, with 2,382 delegates needed to win the nomination. the republican convention will be attended by 2,472 delegates, with 1,237 delegates needed to win.q: i keep hearing about superdelegates. are they different from other delegates? do both the republicans and democrats have superdelegates?a: superdelegates, officially known as unpledged delegates, are a sort of wild card in the nominating process, but only the democrats have them.the category was created for the 1984 democratic convention, and according to political scientists, they are a legacy of the 1980 convention when there was a fight for the nomination between president jimmy carter, who was seeking a second term in the white house, and senator edward kennedy of massachusetts. members of congress were frustrated by their lack of influence, because delegates elected to support one candidate could not switch to support another. so democratic members of the house of representatives led an effort to win a role for themselves. that resulted in the creation of superdelegates. unlike other delegates, superdelegates may change what candidate they are supporting right up to the convention.there is no fixed number of superdelegates because the group is defined by various categories whose members change from one election cycle to another. here is who gets to be a superdelegate:all democratic members of the house of representatives and the senate; the democratic governors; the democratic president and vice president of the united states; former democratic presidents and vice presidents; former democratic leaders of the u.s. senate; former democratic speakers of the house and former democratic minority leaders. throw in the members of the democratic national committee and the former chairs of the dnc and you finally have the whole pool of superdelegates.q: what about the other delegates? do they get to choose which candidate to support?a: both the democratic and republican parties send delegates to their conventions based on the popular vote in the primary elections and caucuses held in each of the 50 states. but the parties have different rules on how delegates are allotted to a candidate.the democratic party applies uniform rules to all states. in each state, delegates are allocated in proportion to the percentage of the primary or caucus vote in each district. but a candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote to be allocated any delegates.the republican party lets states determine their own rules, although it does dictate some things. some states award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, although most such states have a minimum percentage that a candidate must reach to win any delegates. some other states use the winner-take-all method, in which the candidate with the highest percentage of the popular vote is awarded all the delegates. other states use a combination of the two methods.states that use the proportionate method may instead use the winner-take-all method if one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the popular vote.in addition, the republican party requires that all states with nominating contests held between march 1 and march 14 use the proportional method, meaning that all the states holding votes on super tuesday will have to award delegates proportionally.q: what happens to delegates if a candidate drops out of the race?a: another good question, because we have certainly seen that happen this year.for the democratic party, in every state, delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates.nomination about delegates, not votesthe power brokers of the democrat party are not about to let crazy uncle bernie represent them in the presidential election this year. he is anxious to flatten the economic map in the nation and go much further than obama has in stealing from the rich and destroying the wealth generating engine of the country. perhaps the elite wish things to do down a bit differently than what sanders has in mind.it turns out that the new hampshire primary, which bernie won in a landslide, will probably award him fewer delegates than hillary receives.sanders won 60 percent of the vote, but thanks to the democratic party s nominating system, he leaves the granite state with at least 13 delegates while she leaves with at least 15 delegates.new hampshire has 24 pledged delegates, which are allotted based on the popular vote. sanders has 13, and clinton has 9, with 2 currently allotted to neither.under democratic national committee rules, new hampshire also has 8 superdelegates, party officials who are free to commit to whomever they like, regardless of how their state votes. their votes count the same as delegates won through the primary.new hampshire has 8 superdelegates, 6 of which are committed to hillary clinton, giving her a total of 15 delegates from new hampshire as of wednesday at 9 a.m.the two remaining superdelegates remain uncommitted, so hillary actually comes out ahead in overall delegate count. clinton has 394 delegates that includes both super delegates and ones that are picked up in primary elections, while bernie now has only 42. in other words the fix is in, and clinton will absolutely be the democrat nominee for president unless she is indicted for her illegal acts dealing with top secret government documents.but as with the assigning of delegates, it seems that the will of the people, along with their clearly declared votes, will be ignored and the coronation will still take place. as some of my friends like to say, hillary for prison, 2016! may it be so.for the republican party, it varies by state. in some states, delegates are required to stick with their original candidate at least through the first ballot at the republican national convention. in some other states, if a candidate drops out, his or her delegates may immediately pledge to another candidate. there is also a middle ground in which those delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates. via: nypost",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.1,8.412857142857145,14.171428571428573,0.0,0.0
"donald trump, after difficult stretch, shows a softer side - the new york times","it has been a rough few weeks for donald j. trump and his team: a bruising loss in wisconsin, a public campaign and some missteps and gaffes, including his reference to the attacks on the world trade center as occurring “on . ” in a lengthy interview in his office on the 26th floor of trump tower on tuesday, shortly after casting a ballot for himself and hours before the polls closed, the usually boastful mr. trump seemed a bit more humbled as he reflected on his “evolving” campaign and looked to the challenges ahead. alongside his oldest son, donald j. trump jr. and his spokeswoman, hope hicks, mr. trump spoke freely, talking about whether to court delegates with lavish perks like visits to his mansions. below are some condensed excerpts from the conversation. on what it was like to vote for himself in new york on tuesday: i got over to the booth, a lot of people on the street. obviously, they saw somebody was coming, and when i got out, it was all cheers. and then i went in and i got the voter slip, and i saw my name, and i said: “oh, that’s very interesting. i’m voting for myself as president of the united states. ” and it does sort of hit you, a little bit differently than when you’re thinking of it in a different context. you see your name, and it says “president of the united states” on a quite nicely printed form. and check the box. and it’s very big for not very many names. so it’s a great honor. honestly, it’s a great honor. on the recent he ordered, which diminished the role of corey lewandowski, his campaign manager: well, now we are evolving. i’m very happy with my people — the people that both got me here and the people that will take it to the next level. i think that corey, and my whole group, i’m just very happy with them. we’ve become something that’s a very big thing. on jeb bush: i think jeb would have been the nominee had i not gotten in, but i was able to define jeb early. on what he sees as his unique ability to bring fresh thinking to old issues: don’t forget i’m the one that, when jeb would say, “the country was safe when my brother was president,” i said, “excuse me, the world trade center came down. ” do you know, nobody thought of that? it’s like the paper clip. nobody thought about the paper clip except for the guy that thought of it, and he became rich. and everyone else said, “why didn’t i think of that idea?” on the race for delegates: it’s a rigged system. it’s a disgraceful, disgusting rigged system in the republican party. worse than the democratic party, because in the democratic case it’s obvious with superdelegates. look at bernie. he wins every week, and everyone says he can’t win. in the democrat party, it’s obvious because they have a superdelegate, that’s like throwing it in your face. the republican party is worse, the republican party has a system where you can buy the delegates if you want. and you can do anything you want with a delegate, except give them cash. i can play the game better — i can fly them on a 757 to i can fly them to california where i own a place that’s unbelievable, on the pacific ocean. but it’s a bad system. you’re buying the election. it’s really wrong, and i’m looking into it, legally. on whether he will emphasize the economy and trade in the pennsylvania and indiana primaries: i think my message is so incredible for those two places, because they’ve been decimated, they’ve been decimated. there are some places where it wouldn’t work as well. on ted cruz possibly beating him in the delegate race: look, other than the fact that he’s using a corrupt system and rigged system to get delegates, he’d be out of it already. he can’t win. but how do you pick a guy who’s down millions of votes and many hundreds of delegates. i’m already over 200 delegates up. so how do you do that? do you understand? that’s pretty hard. i won. the voters voted for me. i think you’d have bedlam in the party. on top of it, cruz is not a popular guy. he’s not liked. on senator marco rubio of florida’s attempts to wage a war of insults with him: he played don rickles, and then i played don rickles times five. and then he stopped. they had to try something. all right? on not wanting to woo delegates: i don’t like the process of it — you’re buying the election. i’m not ruling anything out, but i’ll tell you what — i think that there’s a serious legal challenge to all of this, and it starts with the “super pacs. ” this is a very serious dilemma for the republican party. on whether he actually wants the job of president or simply wants to win: look, there’s no greater honor. but i’m not doing it for the honor. i’m doing it because i really believe that with substance, intelligence and having the proper ability, which i have, we can make this country so successful, so fast. we can bring it back. you know, make america great again. which is also a great slogan. on how the past year has turned out for him: a couple of people who know me actually said, “be careful what you wish for. ” it was very interesting. it was a compliment. well, they understand that i win. my life is winning. i win. i know how to win. most people don’t know how to win. in golf, in sports, in life — i win, always. better knock on wood.

syrian government team to arrive in geneva for peace talks on wednesday,"beirut/geneva (reuters) - a syrian government delegation will arrive in geneva on wednesday, a day later than expected, to attend peace talks being held there this week, syrian state news agency sana said. the delegation had delayed its planned departure for the talks, which begin on tuesday, because of the opposition s insistence that syrian president bashar al-assad step down. \ the united nations special envoy for syria, staffan de mistura, said the government and opposition would have a chance to negotiate directly for the first time, but it was not clear if they would choose to do so. we are going to offer it. we will see if this takes place. but we will be offering that, he said after meeting the opposition delegation. de mistura has received assurances that the syrian government delegation will attend the talks, u.n. spokeswoman alessandra vellucci told a geneva news briefing. at least we know that they are coming, she said, declining to give details on who transmitted the message from damascus. de mistura said the government had accepted a russian suggestion of a ceasefire in the besieged rebel-held enclave of eastern ghouta near damascus. bombardment on the area killed three people on tuesday, a war monitor said earlier. a delegation from the newly-unified syrian opposition, which arrived in the swiss city on monday, is due to hold a first meeting with de mistura later on tuesday, she said. in an emailed statement, the opposition negotiating committee said it was ready to meet the government side. it (the government) no longer has the pretext that the opposition is fragmented. we are one. we are ready to negotiate directly with the other side, said yahya aridi, the head of the negotiation committee. earlier, the pro-damascus syrian newspaper al-watan reported that the syrian government delegation to an eighth round of peace talks in geneva this week has not yet left damascus. it had reported on monday that the delay was because of the opposition s insistence that assad step down, which he has refused to do. nasr hariri, head of the opposition delegation, told a geneva news conference on monday night that he is aiming for assad s removal as a result of negotiations. the government delegation will be headed by syria s u.n. ambassador and chief negotiator bashar al-ja afari, sana said. a breakthrough in the talks is seen as unlikely as assad and his allies push for total military victory in syria s civil war, now in its seventh year, and his opponents stick by their demand he leave power.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.756666666666668,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0
eu executive moves to punish poland over court reforms,"brussels (reuters) - the eu executive launched an unprecedented process on wednesday to suspend poland s voting rights in the european union after two years of dispute over judicial reforms that brussels says undermine polish courts independence. the european commission, the guardian of eu law, will now ask the other eu governments to declare that poland s changes to the judiciary constitute a clear risk of a serious breach of eu values especially the rule of law. however, it gave warsaw, where a new prime minister took office only this month, three months to remedy the situation and said it could rescind its decision if it did so. often referred to as the eu s nuclear option , the move carries the ultimate threat of sanctions but is in fact unlikely to result in that. the commission has today concluded that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law in poland, the commission said in a statement. judicial reforms in poland mean that the country s judiciary is now under the political control of the ruling majority. in the absence of judicial independence, serious questions are raised about the effective application of eu law. the commission s deputy head, first vice president frans timmermans, who has conducted talks with the polish government dominated by law and justice party leader jaroslaw kaczynski for the past two years, said he was acting with a heavy heart but was obliged to take action to protect the union as a whole. we are open for dialogue 24/7, timmermans said, saying that if prime minister mateusz morawiecki, who took office just this month, were to change tack, he would be ready to respond. but timmermans insisted: as guardians of the treaty, the commission is under a strict responsibility to act ... if the application of the rule of law is left completely to the individual member states, then the whole of the eu will suffer. this decision has no merit. it is in our opinion a purely political decision, beata mazurek, a spokeswoman for poland s ruling party, was quoted as saying by state news agency pap. stung by britain s vote last year to leave the union, the eu institutions are battling a rise in euroskeptic nationalism across the continent and particularly in the former communist east, where poland s ally hungary has also prompted previously the commission to threaten sanctions over the rule of law. seeking to counter warsaw s accusations of an anti-polish bias in brussels and in his own behavior, timmermans, who once worked in the soviet bloc as a dutch diplomat, praised poland s historic contribution to overcoming the cold war divide of europe but said warsaw now bore a special responsibility to prevent new rifts opening up over democratic principles. i want to stand by the polish people in this time which is very difficult for them, and for us, he said, adding that the defending a separation of powers was of existential importance not just for the polish nation but for the eu as a whole . the next step in the process is that eu governments, meeting in the council of the european union, will hear poland out and ask it to address their concerns. but if 22 out of the eu s 28 countries and the european parliament are not satisfied in the end, the process will move on to the next stages, which may mean sanctions. the sanctions can involve the suspension of the rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the member state in question, including the voting rights . this formulation leaves open the possibility also of suspending eu financial transfers to poland, now the biggest beneficiary of european funds aimed at boosting living standards in the former communist country. sanctions can be imposed with the backing of a majority of countries representing a majority of the eu s citizens. but to get to that stage, eu governments have first to unanimously agree that what was initially just a risk of a serious breach of the rule of law has now become a reality. this is unlikely to happen, because hungary has already declared that it would not support such a motion against poland. but the mere threat of it underlines the sharp deterioration in ties between warsaw and brussels since the nationalist law and justice (pis) party won power in late 2015. the commission and council of europe legal experts, known as the venice commission, say poland s judicial reforms undermine judges independence because they give the ruling party control over the sacking and the appointments of judges, as well as the option to end the terms of some supreme court judges early. the council of europe, europe s human rights watchdog, has compared such measures to those of the soviet system. the pis government rejects these accusations, saying the changes are needed because courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist era-mentality. polish president andrzej duda has until jan. 5 to sign them into law.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
remember when bernie sanders was literally slapped in the face by the establishment? (video),"during the 1988 democratic presidential primaries, rev. jesse jackson emerged as an outside viable contender for the democratic party nomination against establishment backed massachusetts governor michael dukakis. an ardent supporter of rev. jesse jackson s presidential bid was bernie sanders, who was mayor of burlington, vermont at the time.during a democratic caucus in burlington, sanders gave a speech in support of jackson while many democrats in the room turned their backs as he spoke, and one woman actually slapped him in the face as sanders walked off stage. sanders helped rev. jackson win vermont against dukakis by one delegate in 1988. although dukakis would later win the democratic presidential nomination, rev. jackson made it closer than any black person before to becoming president. bernie sanders was one of the few elected officials at the time to cross the color line and openly endorse rev. jackson over mike dukakis. his speech in support of rev. jackson had many parallels to his speeches along his own campaign trail, such as one of his signature sayings: enough is enough. sanders also praised rev. jackson for bringing together disenfranchised voters, and focusing on issues such as wealth inequality and racial injustice. jackson s 1988 campaign platform closely resembles sanders current campaign platform. dr. cornel west, who has been campaigning on behalf of senator sanders for several months and worked for both of rev. jackson s presidential campaigns, likened sanders as an insurgent on par with jesse jackson, but even more progressive for sanders criticisms of wall street are more direct. jesse jackson is a serious candidate for the presidency. he was always serious; it was just that the political scientists and the other politicians who belittled his campaign, trivialized his efforts. and disdained his prospects. despite the contempt and condescension of the media or perhaps because of it-jackson went to the most remote and isolated grass roots in the american social landscape to find the strength for a campaign that has already begun to transform politics, wrote the editorial board of the publication, the nation, in its 1988 endorsement of jesse jackson for president. for five years his distance from the funders, the managers, the mediators and the consultants who manipulate the democratic party and legitimize its candidates has allowed jackson to do unimaginable things and say unspeakable words about race, about class, about equality and, indeed, about democracy. to an extent that may be unique in presidential elections in this century, he derives his power from the people. nearly two decades later, not much has changed in that the issues brought to the national spotlight by jesse jackson have yet to be adequately addressed by the democratic party in a meaningful way, and are rarely ever mentioned in the republican party at all.bernie sanders campaign provides hope that those inadequacies may be resolved if he wins. galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money, wrote the editorial board of the nation in its 2016 endorsement of sanders for president. sanders s clarion call for fundamental reform single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes has inspired working people across the country. the relationship between bernie sanders and rev. jesse jackson has started to become more public in response to criticisms from hillary clinton supporters that sanders would somehow be less effective in fighting for civil rights and racial justice. clinton s lead in south carolina is dependent on maintaining her support with the black community, who make up about half of democratic voters in the state, but that relationship was somewhat strained after her loss there in 2008 was cited by her husband, bill clinton, as due to barack obama being another black candidate like jesse jackson, who won the state in 2008.in an interview with the hill, rev. jesse jackson said he had no plans to endorse any democratic presidential candidate, as he has a history of working with both bernie sanders and hillary clinton. an endorsement would also likely have negative implications regarding support for his rainbow/push coalition.despite his neutrality, jackson did defend bernie sanders from criticism over his civil rights record recently in an interview with the daily caller: bernie was fighting back in chicago not in the deep-south in affordable housing struggles in chicago, jackson said. the movement was so broad based. there were civil rights leaders in chicago. jackson referred to a smear tactic employed by journalists and media sensationalists to skew a response from civil rights hero, congressman john lewis (d-ga). rep. lewis responded to a reporter s inquiry that he never saw or met bernie sanders during the civil rights movement, but the response was taken out of context to infer lewis suggested bernie sanders was not involved in the civil rights movement or was exaggerating his involvement. having heard rep. lewis speak a few months ago and interviewing him in person afterwards, i knew an accusation or character attack of that nature from the congressman was highly unlikely. congressman lewis clarified the remarks were not meant to be taken as any sort of criticism or allegations. featured image via flickr",1,14,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,11.784285714285716,14.171428571428573,0.0,0.0

becoming duterte: the making of a philippine strongman - the new york times,"davao city, philippines — president rodrigo duterte relishes the image of . he boasts of killing criminals with his own hand. on occasion, he calls for mass murder. speaking of the drug addicts he says are destroying the philippines, he said, “i would be happy to slaughter them. ” mr. duterte and his friends have long cultivated legends of his sadistic exploits, like throwing a drug lord from a helicopter and forcing a tourist who violated a smoking ban to eat his cigarette butt at gunpoint. it is a thuggish image that mr. duterte embraces. whether mr. duterte has done what he says — the killings he claims to have carried out are impossible to verify — he has realized his gory vision in national policy. first as a mayor, now as president of the philippines, he has encouraged the police and vigilantes to kill thousands of people with impunity. while his draconian justice and coarse manner have earned him widespread condemnation outside the philippines, an look at his rise to power and interviews with many people close to him reveal a man of multiple contradictions. he has alienated many with outrageous comments and irrational behavior, yet remains wildly popular. he is an antidrug crusader, yet has struggled with drug abuse himself. and he grew up a child of privilege, the son of a provincial governor, yet was subjected to regular beatings. his mother whipped him so often for his misbehavior that she wore out her horsewhip, according to his brother, emmanuel duterte. at parochial school, he was caned by jesuit priests and, the president says, molested by one. by his teenage years, he was known as a street brawler. “violence in the house, violence in the school and violence in the neighborhood,” emmanuel duterte said. “that is why he is always angry. because if you have pain when you are young, you are angry all the time. ” years later, a psychological assessment of mr. duterte, prepared in 1998 for the annulment of his marriage, concluded that he had “narcissistic personality disorder” and a “pervasive tendency to demean, humiliate others and violate their rights. ” nonetheless, his ailing campaigned for his presidential bid last year. that act of devotion only begins to unravel the paradox that is mr. duterte. behind his brutish caricature, according to interviews with dozens of mr. duterte’s friends, family members, allies and critics, is a man who can be charming and engaging. he has many loyal friends and a soft spot for sick children. as mayor of davao city, he was known to help people in need by digging into his pocket and handing them a wad of cash. to many, his vulgar jokes only burnish his bona fides as a man of the people. when he appears in public, he is swarmed by adoring fans. still, the bodies have been piling up. since mr. duterte took office last june and declared a “war” on drugs, the police and unknown assassins have killed more than 3, 600 people, the police say, mostly in the slums of philippine cities. some put the toll at more than 7, 000. “i might go down in the history as the butcher,” he acknowledged unapologetically in january. in less than nine months, he has already surpassed the death toll of president ferdinand marcos, whose forces killed about 3, 300 political opponents and activists during his harsh rule. yet his gangland approach to combating crime and drugs has largely endeared him to filipinos who have suffered high rates of violent crime and who see him as a refreshing change from the sophisticated but elite who have ruled this country for most of the last three decades. the dissonance between the image of the gentle, caring grandfather and the brutal strongman spilling blood on the streets is just one of many in a president who was born to the elite and has lived a life surrounded by violence. rodrigo roa duterte grew up in davao city, in the southern philippines, the oldest son of the governor of davao province. as a teenager, he hung out with the toughest kids, got into fights and learned the rude expressions he uses today. by 15, he was carrying a gun, his brother said. as a freshman at the ateneo de davao high school, he was fondled by an american priest, an experience he revealed only in 2015. he identified the priest as the rev. mark falvey, who later moved to california and died in 1975. the jesuit order agreed in 2007 to pay $16 million to nine people father falvey molested as children at a hollywood church. mr. duterte retaliated against another priest who had punished him by filling a squirt gun with ink and spraying the priest’s white cassock, his siblings said. for that, he was expelled. he often skipped classes and likes to tell audiences that it took him seven years to finish high school. his misbehavior was often overlooked because of his status, family members say. “he was known as the governor’s son,” said his older sister, eleanor duterte. a daredevil, he took flying lessons at 16. on his first solo flight, he buzzed the family home and hit a treetop with the wheel of his piper cub, emmanuel duterte said. later, a car accident put him in a coma for two days, his sister jocellyn duterte said. the first time he killed a man, he says, was in a drunken beach brawl at age 17. “maybe i stabbed somebody to death,” he told an interviewer two years ago. his reputation as a womanizer is well founded, but it was often women who sought him out. “being the governor’s son,” jocellyn duterte said, “the women were always available. ” his father told him that since he was always in trouble, he could save legal fees by becoming a lawyer, his brother recalled, so rodrigo went to law school. in his final year, he shot and wounded a fellow student whom he accused of bullying him. mr. duterte graduated anyway and became a prosecutor. “one thing about my brother is he is hardheaded,” emmanuel duterte said. “the more you tell him not to do it, the more he will do it. he needs to tone down on his anger. he needs anger management. ” in the 1980s, his mother led frequent marches against president marcos’s dictatorial rule. after his ouster, president corazon aquino offered her the post of davao’s vice mayor. she asked that rodrigo be appointed instead, friends and family said. two years later, in 1988, he ran for mayor and won, starting a lifelong streak in which he has never lost an election. when he took office, much of davao was a war zone. the iron rule of the marcos era had ended, and communist rebels held a large part of the city. armed groups operated with impunity and assassinations of police officers were common. making the city safe was mr. duterte’s biggest challenge, and one he accepted personally. jesus g. dureza, a high school friend who is now a adviser, recalls seeing him late one night in the taxi he often drove to patrol the city. mr. duterte said he was hunting for a man who had been robbing cabdrivers. mr. dureza noticed that his pistol was cocked. “he had a death wish,” mr. dureza said. shortly after he became mayor, crime suspects started turning up dead on davao’s streets. mr. duterte and his supporters have long denied the existence of a death squad in davao city. but in september, edgar matobato, 57, came forward and told a senate committee that he worked as an assassin on the squad for 24 years, killing about 50 people. in an interview with the new york times, he said the death squad was founded in 1988 at a lunch he attended at the old menseng hotel with mr. duterte, several police officers and six other recruits. they were told their job was to hunt down criminals. a police officer passed around a covered basket, and each recruit took out a weapon. mr. matobato considered it good fortune that he drew a . 45. “the only one who could command the davao death squad was mayor duterte,” he told the times. “if there was an order to kill, it had to be with his clearance. without his orders, we kill no one. ” mr. duterte took part in at least one killing, mr. matobato said. in 2007, a chance encounter on the road with a man named vicente amisola led to a shootout. after mr. amisola ran out of ammunition, mr. matobato said, mr. duterte arrived, grabbed an uzi and emptied two magazines at the defenseless mr. amisola. when they checked mr. amisola’s body, the squad discovered that he worked for the national bureau of investigation. arnold rosales, the bureau’s acting regional director in davao, said that mr. matobato’s account of mr. amisola’s killing matched the findings of the bureau’s investigation except for one detail: the allegation of mr. duterte’s involvement. investigators concluded that the death was a result of miscommunication, and no charges were filed, mr. rosales said. the investigative report is missing, he said. in february, a former police officer, arthur lascañas, 56, came forward and confessed to having led the death squad. he said that he received orders to kill directly from mr. duterte and that he had killed 200 people. “all the killings that we committed in davao city, whether they were buried or thrown in the sea, were paid for by mayor duterte,” he said. of the more than 1, 400 people the davao death squad is believed to have killed, at least one was not a crime suspect. jun pala, a journalist and outspoken critic of mr. duterte’s, was gunned down near his home in 2003. mr. lascañas said the mayor ordered the killing, and that mr. lascañas helped carry it out. mr. duterte has never directly addressed the accusations made by mr. matobato or mr. lascañas, and he declined to be interviewed for this article. after mr. matobato’s testimony, mr. duterte accused the senator who led the committee of taking payoffs from drug lords. she was arrested and jailed last month. mr. duterte’s personal death toll is harder to substantiate. if he stabbed someone on the beach, there is no record of it. in boasting that he hunted down suspects by night, he offered no specifics. his claim to have killed “about three people” probably refers to a 1988 hostage raid in which he says he fired an at three kidnappers. but he recently acknowledged, “i may have hit them all or none at all. ” becoming president has been an adjustment for mr. duterte, who is 71. for months, he still thought of himself as mayor and often called himself that. he prefers to go home to davao city rather than stay in the sprawling presidential palace complex in manila. in a land that is notoriously corrupt and where government officials often live like kings, he has lived for decades in the same modest house where he only recently installed . pomilda daniel, a neighbor, calls him “a simple man. ” she said that mr. duterte once admired her large new television and asked if he could have it if it ever broke so that he could fix it and use it. yet when he discovered during a visit to the house of hope, a child cancer treatment center in davao, that the children had no televisions, he returned the same day with nine tv sets and had them installed, said dr. mae dolendo, a pediatric oncologist who heads the center. “he is very, very compassionate,” she said. “we have had presidents who conducted themselves like we would expect presidents to conduct themselves, but they haven’t solved the country’s problems. he’s not perfect. he curses. but he gets things done. ” mr. duterte has no official first lady and boasted during his campaign that he had two wives and two girlfriends. later, he said that he should give pfizer an award for creating viagra. in 1973, he eloped with elizabeth zimmerman, a former flight attendant, after courting her for a month. the marriage lasted until 2000, when it was annulled. the psychological assessment of mr. duterte prepared for the annulment, a copy of which was obtained by the times, was based on an examination of ms. duterte and is not a diagnosis. in addition to the finding of narcissism, it described mr. duterte as a “control freak” and womanizer who began having affairs soon after he was married and flaunted his infidelity by bringing girlfriends to public functions. while still married, mr. duterte met cielito avanceña, a teenage contestant in a beauty pageant who goes by honeylet. she is 25 years his junior. he has described her as his second wife, although they never married. ms. duterte and ms. avanceña declined to be interviewed. perhaps some of the president’s mercurial behavior stems from the constant pain he suffers and his use of narcotics to treat it. mr. duterte has made a political career of fighting drugs but acknowledged in december that he had been abusing the opioid fentanyl, the powerful and addictive drug that killed the musician prince last april. mr. duterte began using fentanyl to treat back pain and migraines from a spinal injury, apparently a result of a motorcycle accident a few years ago. his doctor prescribed a quarter of a fentanyl skin patch, the president said, but he began using an entire patch at a time. when his doctor discovered that, he ordered him to quit. “he said: ‘stop it. the first thing that you would lose is your cognitive ability,’” the president recounted. “‘you are, you know, abusing the drug. ’” mr. duterte has not said publicly when he started using fentanyl or whether he has stopped. in december, he denied being addicted. his communications director, martin andanar, said that mr. duterte had stopped using fentanyl “way before he was elected president” last may. but a person with knowledge of his condition told the times in september that mr. duterte was using the drug then. mr. duterte’s energy and hair belie his age, but his afflictions have taken their toll. during public appearances, he often presses his fingers against a nerve on the side of his face to reduce the pain. he has skipped several public events because of illness. in his speeches, he sometimes suggests he will not live to serve out his term. he has not explained why. decades ago, mr. duterte learned that he had two rare conditions, barrett’s esophagus and buerger’s disease, which prompted him to quit drinking and smoking. as mayor, he enforced a strict public smoking ban, and he is now considering a similar measure nationwide. he dislikes being questioned about his health. after a reporter asked for his medical report, he publicly rebuked the journalist, demanding, “how is your wife’s vagina?” mr. duterte’s outrageous remarks have left many with the impression that he is unhinged. he says god speaks to him and made him president of this heavily roman catholic country. he has compared himself to hitler. he used a term that translates as “son of a whore” to describe both pope francis and president barack obama. antonio trillanes, a senator, recalled that when they met in 2015 to discuss a political alliance, mr. duterte only wanted to talk about people he had killed and “how the brains were splattered all over the place, gangland style. ” he seems never to have questioned the proposition that shooting people on the street is the best remedy for crime and addiction. “i have my own political philosophy,” he said recently. “do not destroy my country, because i will kill you. ” he scoffs at complaints about lack of due process for people killed by his police force and has threatened to kill human rights activists. on numerous occasions, his aides have had to walk back his comments. press secretary ernesto abella cautioned journalists that they should use their “creative imagination” to understand him and not be “too literal. ” that mr. duterte’s violent boasts should not always be taken literally matters little to his zealous supporters and is of little consolation to the families of the thousands killed by his policies. “he is a child of privilege, but he became a champion of the little guy,” said ken angeles, mr. duterte’s college roommate and lifelong friend. “he’s a very passionate guy. ” senator trillanes, now a leading critic of mr. duterte, has another name for him: “mass murderer.

"neither george bush voted for trump, book author tells new york times","(reuters) - george h.w. bush and his son george w. bush did not vote for fellow republican donald trump last year, says the author of a new book on the 41st and 43rd u.s. presidents in which they open up about their disapproval of the man now occupying the white house. the elder bush voted for hillary clinton, while his son voted for neither trump nor his democratic challenger, or “none of the above,” said mark k. updegrove, who wrote “the last republicans” with the cooperation of the two bushes. harpercollins will publish the book on nov. 14. in an interview with the new york times, updegrove said the elder bush, 93, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, had an instinctive dislike of trump though he did not know him personally. in an interview during the 2016 presidential campaign, george h.w. bush told the author that trump was a “blowhard,” driven by “a certain ego” and lacking a commitment to public service. the younger bush, 71, who served in the white house from 2001 to 2009, believed candidate trump lacked both humility and a necessary understanding of the presidency, updegrove said in previewing the book about the relationship between the bushes, written with the cooperation of the father and son. during the campaign, george w. bush told the author that he feared he would turn out to be the last republican elected president. “at the time, i think he was concerned that hillary clinton would win,” updegrove told the times. “but if you look at his values and those shared by his father and ronald reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the republican party today, in particular the platform that donald trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia,” said updegrove, a historian who has written several books about the presidency. updegrove could not be reached for further comment. “the american people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change - instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests,” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said in a statement. “if they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won.” like many americans, george w. bush was surprised that trump fared so well in last year’s republican state primaries, where his brother jeb, a former florida governor, emerged as one of trump’s most frequent targets. during the campaign, the billionaire real estate developer, a political novice, promised to “drain the swamp” in washington, a vow that extended to the republican establishment, which the bush family epitomized. the book follows a rare speech by the younger bush in which he delivered a sweeping yet thinly veiled critique of the trump administration’s policies and the president’s blunt style. the 43rd president decried “bullying and prejudice” in public life while defending open immigration and trade, two of the pillars of previous republican administrations that have come under sustained attack by the new president.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.84,4.800000000000001,0.0,0.0
"california today: meet the new mayor, age 26 - the new york times","good morning. (want to get california today by email? sign up.) california pulled off several mayoral firsts on election day. the city of elk grove in sacramento county elected steve ly, the first hmong mayor anywhere in the country. in berkeley, jesse arreguin became the city’s first latino mayor. and in stockton, voters elected not only the city’s first black mayor, but also its youngest ever — the michael tubbs. californians have in the past elected a number of mayors, but perhaps never in a city the size of stockton, with a diverse population north of 300, 000. (the league of california cities said it did not track the ages of mayors.) mr. tubbs, a city council member for the last four years, focused his campaign on renewal in a city that was hammered by the 2008 housing crisis. “he sort of represents, i think, people’s hopes for the future of stockton,” said keith w. smith, an associate professor of political science at university of the pacific, which has a campus in stockton. mr. tubbs, a democrat, won 70 percent of the vote, a result that was also seen as a repudiation of his rival. the campaign of the incumbent mayor anthony silva, a republican, was tainted by reports of improper conduct. the latest was an arrest over accusations that he gave alcohol to minors during a strip poker game. mr. silva did not respond to requests for comment. “so as much as the vote is for michael tubbs a lot of the vote is also against anthony silva,” professor smith said. mr. tubbs was born in south stockton to a teenage mother and an incarcerated father. he went on to graduate from stanford and intern at google and the white house, before going into politics. speaking on thursday, he said he was “a little overwhelmed” by his victory. “coming from where i’m from, living in poverty, not coming from a political family, it’s an incredible honor,” he said. asked what his political future might hold, mr. tubbs said he was focused on the job at hand. as a however, he was more candid. in 2008, mr. tubbs was part of a team that won a national debate competition sponsored by the n. a. a. c. p. as a result, he got to meet senator barack obama, then the presumptive democratic presidential nominee. ”i looked at him, shook his hand and told him, ‘i’m next,’” mr. tubbs said, according to one local news account. “he said, ‘o. k.’” • los angeles leaders began outlining a battle plan against deportations of people who are in the country illegally.

arab coalition says will keep yemen port open; air raids kill at least nine,"aden (reuters) - the saudi-led coalition fighting in yemen said on wednesday it would keep the houthi-controlled hodeidah port, vital for aid, open for a month despite a fresh missile attack against riyadh, but it kept up air raids that killed at least nine people. the western-backed coalition, which controls yemen s airspace and port access, said last month it would allow humanitarian relief through hodeidah following a nearly three-week blockade imposed because of a missile attack toward the saudi capital s international airport. the saudis say the red sea port, which is yemen s main entry point for food and humanitarian supplies, is also a hub used by the houthis to bring in weapons, which it accuses iran of supplying. tehran denies the charges. on wednesday, the coalition confirmed it would keep access open to the port despite another missile attack at riyadh on tuesday by the houthis which saudi forces also intercepted. keen to maintain humanitarian aid to the brotherly yemeni people and as a result of intensified inspection measures, the coalition command announces that hodeidah port will remain open for humanitarian and relief supplies, the coalition said in a statement carried by saudi state news agency spa on wednesday. the saudi ambassador to sanaa said the coalition would also allow the provision of four cranes to the port to boost aid deliveries to the war-damaged country. the ambassador, mohammed al-jaber, who was speaking in a televised news conference, did not give details on how the cranes would be delivered. earlier this year, the united nations said the coalition turned back four cranes the united states donated to the world food programme to boost aid operations at hodeidah. the cranes would have replaced parts of the port s infrastructure destroyed by coalition air strikes in august 2015, damage that forced ships to line up offshore because they could not be unloaded. the coalition said ships bringing in fuel and food would also be allowed to enter for another 30 days while proposals made by the united nations envoy to yemen were implemented, it added. the agency did not elaborate on the proposals. but the coalition has been demanding that a u.n. inspection regime agreed in 2015 be further tightened to prevent weapons from reaching the houthis. salman-trump call saudi state news agency spa said king salman discussed in a telephone call with u.s. president donald trump ways to hold the iranian regime accountable for its hostile acts and its involvement in supplying the houthi militia with missiles to threaten the security of the kingdom and the region . the white house later confirmed the call and said the two leaders agreed on the importance of reinvigorating a political process to end the war in yemen and that the king briefed trump on a saudi plan to alleviate the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict. tuesday s missile attack took place as the houthis marked 1,000 days since the coalition intervened in the yemen war in march 2015 to try to restore president abd-rabbu mansour hadi after a houthi advance on his base in aden forced him to flee. saudi arabia said that since the war began the houthis had fired 83 ballistic missiles toward the kingdom. more than 10,000 people have been killed and a humanitarian crisis unleashed in a conflict which has intensified since former president ali abdullah saleh was killed on dec. 4. coalition forces, which are supported by the united states and britain, meanwhile launched fresh air strikes overnight. residents said at least nine members of the same family, including at least five children, were killed in one air strike which hit their home in wadi khair in southern yemen s shabwa province. coalition aircraft have been providing air support for southern fighters and pro-government troops as part of a push to clear the houthis from shabwa and the family were killed in an apparently mistaken attack. residents also reported that coalition aircraft bombed a new parliament chamber, part of a government compound being built in sanaa, causing damage but no casualties. the coalition had no immediate comment on the report but says it does not target civilians. similar air strikes in which civilian homes, markets and hospitals were hit are recurrent in yemen. on monday, eight women and two children from the same family died when war planes struck a vehicle returning from a wedding party in marib, east of sanaa.",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.727142857142859,8.457142857142857,0.07142857142857142,0.07142857142857142

lessons of syria: russia to form a 'superlight' brigade equipped with 'technicals',"politics lessons of syria: russia to form a 'superlight' brigade equipped with 'technicals' russian ministry of defense wants to take a uaz pickup and strap on it a machine gun, a grenade launcher or anti-tank missiles and use them to conduct raids over open terrain originally appeared at russian defense policy izvestiya reports that defense minister sergey shoygu is organizing some “superlight” army brigades. it’s an interesting turn given that his widely discredited predecessor anatoliy serdyukov also looked at forming light motorized rifle brigades based on wheeled vehicles. perhaps the latter’s mistake was that the vehicles weren’t necessarily russian-made. shoygu’s “superlight” brigades will use the uaz patriot — either the suv or pickup variant. the suv is referred to as a jeep at times. an earlier model — the hunter — actually resembles a jeep. uaz-hunter.jpg uaz hunter the intent, reportedly based on syrian combat experience, is for these “superlight” motorized rifle brigades to slip around or through heavier enemy forces to conduct raids at distances of several hundred kilometers. according to izvestiya, the uaz patriot or pickup is supposed to carry up to seven soldiers (a highly dubious proposition), their weapons and gear, as well as additional fuel, supplies, and ammo. it will be armed with either a 30-mm ags-30 automatic grenade launcher or kornet or konkurs atgms, as well as a 12.7-mm kord machine gun. the brigade’s mortar batteries are supposed to have 82-mm 2b14 podnos mortars mounted on the uaz vehicles. an mod official familiar with the developments told izvestiya the formation of the “superlight” brigades has begun, and they will appear “soon” in the southern and central mds. they will have less personnel and equipment than traditional mrbs, but will be more mobile and maneuverable. the “superlight” brigades will also have one battalion in btr-82s as well as artillery and mrl battalions. izvestiya got a comment from vladislav shurygin: “these battalions are being developed from the experience of combat actions in syria. in a day, the typical motorized rifle battalion equipped with armored personnel carriers or infantry fighting vehicles can complete a march of not more than100 km. but an mrb in the uaz patriot can go several hundred kilometers in a day. moreover, acting in small groups, motorized rifle platoons and companies in pickups can slip through enemy forces and deliver quick strikes. but these battalions are only effective in desert, steppe, and semidesert terrain. in forests and forest-steppe, automobile-mounted infantry loses out to infantry in bmps and btrs in combat capability.” izvestiya notes that, in 2009, serdyukov put the 56th independent air-assault brigade in the uaz hunter, but the experiment was quickly abandoned. the mod official says they were needed and worked well in the volgograd steppe, but it was difficult to fit personnel and equipment in the hunter. soldiers, he said, sat cheek to cheek in very cramped conditions. that brigade returned to its venerable gaz-66 trucks. the same problem is likely with the uaz patriot and pickup. they look like four-seaters. this sounds like a sweet little deal for uaz. it is part of the larger sollers automobile manufacturing group, itself owned by russian steel conglomerate severstal. it’s odd there’s no photo of an uaz patriot or pickup military prototype when the first “superlight” brigades are reportedly almost ready to appear. and there is also potential competition. the military-industrial company (vpk) has its tigr light armored vehicle with a 30-mm gun or kornet or konkurs atgm launchers mounted. the tigr, however, is a larger, heavier, and much more expensive vehicle. gaz might make something comparable to the patriot or pickup. gaz already makes the btr-82. like vpk, gaz is owned ultimately by oleg deripaska. did you enjoy this article? - consider helping us! russia insider depends on your donations: the more you give, the more we can do. $1 $10 other amount if you wish you make a tax-deductible contribution of $1,000 or more, please visit our support page for instructions click here for our commenting guidelines on fire",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.740000000000002,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0

"battleground state recounts are now getting underway, and trump is clearly petrified","it s funny how trump kept screaming that the election was rigged all through his campaign, and now screams there s massive voter fraud everywhere considering that the three states that gave him the white house are getting ready to recount their votes. lawyers for trump are mobilizing to block recounts in michigan and pennsylvania in a panic, trying to stop these efforts. wisconsin s recount is already underway, so good luck there.michigan s recount is set to begin today, yet trump believes that any recount in that state would be lawless, despite the fact that recounting election votes is as american as hot dogs with ketchup at the ballpark. his complaint could stall that recount until it becomes impossible to do it, and that s probably his goal. the board of canvassers is scheduled to discuss trump s specious claims today.in pennsylvania, trump s attorneys accused jill stein of commandeering pennsylvania s electoral process, with an eye toward doing the same to the electoral college. they go on to say that there s no evidence of fraud or tampering, and imply that the recount shouldn t happen because of this. indeed, one judge has blocked recount efforts in one part of the state, but it s not clear what the state itself will do.what are they so afraid of? seriously. trump himself alleged massive voter fraud, and his minions have glommed on to that absurd narrative, but they won. they won the white house, so what s the problem here? if anything, they ought to be celebrating these recounts because they should believe such recounts will just reinforce the legitimacy of trump s win.is it the anomalies in wisconsin that s scaring the living demons out of him? perhaps it s his shrinking margin in pennsylvania that s got him terrified. following philadelphia s final tally, trump s lead shrank from roughly 71,000 to 46,435 votes. that could be scary. or maybe it s the fact that michigan agreed to a recount despite the fact that the state only uses paper ballots.hillary is now down by less than 80,000 votes across all three battleground states.the problems in all three states could be enough to worry him. if he were any kind of classy, though, he d tell them to go ahead with their recounts, and he d have his people tell the press and anyone else who will listen that he s confident these recounts won t reveal anything new.that should be obvious. but what s truly obvious is that trump is scared that the recounts will show he lost. whether they actually will or not remains to be seen, but he and his officials are making complete fools of themselves by contesting the recounts like this.featured image by mark wilson via getty images",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.740000000000002,14.8,0.0,0.0
james comey is doing something that will have trump sh*tting his pants,"trump s numerous attacks on former fbi director james comey are about to come back and bite him in the ass. while trump has spent his time attempting (poorly) to portray comey as someone who is unreliable and worse, the former director has spent his time writing a book.the failing new york times (as the donald says) reports that comey s book will cover his work as a public servant including and perhaps most notably his brief tenure in the trump administration. it s a book about leadership and his search for truth, informed by lessons and experiences he s had throughout his career, including his recent experiences in the trump administration, matt latimer, whose agency also represents comey, says. it will speak to a broader desire in our country for more ethical leadership.it really does sound interesting, and it s no surprise that publishers are willing to hand comey ridiculous amounts of money for it:the book will not be a conventional tell-all memoir, but an exploration of the principles that have guided mr. comey through some of the most challenging moments of his legal career. among those are his investigation into hillary clinton s private email server during a contentious election, and his recent entanglement with the president over the f.b.i. s inquiry into russia s interference in the 2016 election.comey initially was reluctant to write a tell-all, but ultimately decided that he had more to say than just a retelling of his career. the times notes that he plans to use the book to write candidly about his experience serving in multiple administrations, and to use moments from his career to draw lessons about ethics, decision making and leadership. as with his personal memos he shared with the media through a friend, comey s book will be vetted to ensure that no classified information is contained.while the book is simply going to be a study of comey s principles through the years, it is sure to enrage trump, who considers facts and truth to be an anathema.featured image via screengrab",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.08333333333333333,3.84,4.800000000000001,0.0,0.0

senators seek to stop expansion of airport facial scans,"washington (reuters) - two u.s. senators on thursday urged federal authorities to halt the planned expansion of a $1 billion airport facial scanning program, saying the technology used to identify travelers on some flights departing from nine u.s. airports for international destinations may not be not accurate enough and raises privacy concerns. congress has approved the use of the program for non-u.s. citizens, but never expressly authorized its use for americans. the department of homeland security has said the system is needed to prevent travelers from leaving the country using someone else’s identity and to prevent visitors to the united states from overstaying their visas. senators mike lee, a republican, and edward markey, a democrat, in a letter to department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen, raised concerns that too many travelers would be inconvenienced by faulty scan results and questioned why americans are being subjected to the screens, known as biometric exit detection technology. in the letter, they raised objections to expanding the program beyond the nine airports where it is already in use. “we request that dhs stop the expansion of this program and provide congress with its explicit statutory authority to use and expand a biometric exit program on u.s. citizens,” the senators wrote. “if there is no specific authorization, then we request an explanation for why dhs believes it has the authority to proceed” they cited a report released thursday by georgetown university law school’s center on privacy & technology that found dhs is conducting the scans “without basic legal and technical safeguards - or any meaningful justification of its billion-dollar cost.” congress in 2016 authorized spending up to $1 billion over 10 years on the facial scans. the u.s. customs and border protection (cbp), on its website, says the program collects “facial images from all travelers from the united states” on a flight and uses the images to verify identities. it says the images are stored for no more than two weeks and says that “cbp is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all travelers.” the government said thursday that u.s. citizens may opt out of the facial screening and instead have a separate review of their id documents. a u.s. customs and border protection spokeswoman said the government is working to establish the biometric exit program “in a way that’s most efficient and secure for the traveler and that is least disruptive for the travel industry.” airports using the system include boston, las vegas, miami, new york’s john f. kennedy, washington dulles, both houston airports, chicago o’hare and atlanta. the senators want dhs to provide data that the program will not unduly burden travelers. dhs said previously its goal is a 96 percent “true accept rate,” meaning the technology can positively identify 96 percent of the faces it scans. the senators, however, said this meant “there would still be a false denial for one in 25 travelers. further there is evidence that certain face scans exhibit different error rate depending on the race or gender of the person being scanned.” dhs has said travelers who cannot be verified are escorted to another area where customs and border patrol uses other methods to verify their identity. the georgetown law report also noted that dhs has not established any rules governing the program. “it’s as if dhs has hired a billion-dollar bouncer to check ids but never checked how good he is at spotting a fake,” said laura moy, deputy director of the center and co-author of the report. “they also don’t know if he’s biased against certain groups of people.” the senators said dhs also needed safeguards to ensure facial data is not shared with other u.s. agencies.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.58666666666667,12.488888888888889,0.1111111111111111,0.0

michigan silently gave clean water to state employees for months before flint crisis broke,"starting an entire year ago in january of 2015 long before the flint water crisis broke into mainstream public awareness the michigan department of technology, management & budget determined that state employees needed an alternate source of clean drinking water. they began stocking water coolers on each floor of their offices for employee use.flint residents were sent a notice that the level of trihalomethanes, which can cause liver and kidney problems, were exceeding federal limits yet the city insisted the water was still fine and no actions needed to be taken to correct it. the notice followed two separate boil advisories in august and september of 2014. despite assuring the citizens of the city that the water was safe, officials at the capitol gave state employees clean water to drink from coolers, instead of municipal sources like fountains and faucetsaccording to documentation, the coolers were to remain for employees to use as long as the public water does not meet treatment requirements. via progress michiganthe residents of flint, as you know by now, did not deserve such consideration. it took nearly an entire year for them to start being taken seriously by the state government. this came only after the story finally broke loose in the national media in a huge and embarrassing spectacle for state republicans. if the media had not forced state republicans hands on this issue, people would still be drinking poison today. water only started being distributed in january of 2016 in any kind of substantial way in the city, by the national guard.even the excuse of saving money which was given by the governor has been called into doubt. recent emails which were released by governor rick snyder under intense pressure by the media show that if flint had simply stayed with detroit water the city would have saved as much, if not more money, anyway.featured image via pixabay",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.255714285714287,14.171428571428573,0.0,0.0

breaking: oregon armed militia holding federal building [video],"oregon ranchers take a stand: the feds felt a rancher father and son didn t spend enough time in prison for arson so they ordered them jailed again. father and son, dwight and steven hammond, were ordered back to jail for burning land in an effort to keep it from endangering their property: call to action: patriot call to action: a major storm is brewing in oregon over fed gov charging rancher with terrorism for insane reasonhere s the lowdown from superstation95:the feds, operating outside the law, are trying to jail two men without legal jurisdiction. instead the tables turned when armed militiamen seized their federal complex instead!the bundy family of nevada joined with hard-core militiamen saturday to take over the headquarters of the malheur national wildlife refuge, vowing to occupy the remote federal outpost 50 miles southeast of burns pictured below for years.the occupation came shortly after an estimated 300 marchers militia and local citizens both paraded through burns to protest the prosecution of two harney county ranchers, dwight hammond jr. and steven hammond, who are to report to prison monday.the story could set the stage for a western-style soap opera. i call it as the sagebrush burns, said erin maupin of the long and storied history involving the bureau of land management (blm), special interest groups and the cattle ranchers on the steens mountain of oregon.the latest scene involved two ranchers being sentenced to five years in federal prison for inadvertantly burning about 140 acres of blm rangeland in two separate fires, years ago. that is an area big enough to feed about three cow-calf pairs for a year in that neck of the woods.dwight, 73 and son steven, 46, admitted in a 2012 court case, to lighting two different fires. both fires started on hammonds private property. an august lightening storm started numerous fires and a burn ban was in effect while blm firefighters fought those fires. despite the ban, without permission or notification to blm, steven hammond started several back fires in an attempt to save the ranch s winter feed. the back burn fire break worked and protected the hammond s ranch. blm firefighters saw the back-burn and called it into their headquarters as an arson. sadly, wind drove the back-burn onto federal land, on which the hammonds paid for grazing rights. despite this, the us attorney for oregon prosecuted the two men, saying they committed arson against federal property along with nine other charges. the jury convicted the men of only two charges, starting the fires they readily admitted to starting.arson against federal property calls for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years prison. the hammonds argued that such minimum mandatory sentences were unconstitutional and a judge agreed. he sentenced the two men to less than the five years. not satisfied, the us attorney appealed and the ninth us circuit ordered the district court to re-sentence the men in accordance with the statute.the fires:the first, in 2001, was a planned burn on hammonds own property to reduce juniper trees that have become invasive in that part of the country. that fire burned outside the hammonds private property line and took in 138 acres of unfenced blm land before the hammonds got it put out. no blm firefighters were needed to help extinguish the fire and no fences were damaged.dwight s wife susan shared some crucial details in an exclusive interview with superstation95. they called and got permission to light the fire, she said, adding that was customary for ranchers conducting range management burns a common practice in the area. we usually called the interagency fire outfit a main dispatch to be sure someone wasn t in the way or that weather would be a problem. susan said her son steven was told that the blm was conducting a burn of their own somewhere in the region that very same day, but that they believed there would be no problem with the hammonds going ahead with their planned fire. the court transcript includes the same information in a recording from that phone conversation.in cross-examination of a prosecution witness, the court transcript also includes admission from mr. ward, a range conservationist that the 2001 fire improved the rangeland conditions on blm.maupin, a former range technician and watershed specialist who resigned from the blm in 1999, said that collaborative burns between private ranchers and the blm had become popular in the late 1990s because local university extension researchers were recommending it as a means to manage invasive juniper that steal water from grass and other cover. juniper encroachment had become an issue on the forefront and was starting to come to a head. we were trying to figure out how to deal with it on a large scale, said the woman whose family also neighbored the hammonds for a couple of years. in 1999, the blm started to try to do large scale burn projects. we started to be successful on the steens mountain especially when we started to do it on a large watershed scale as opposed to trying to follow property lines. because private and federal land is intermingled, collaborative burns were much more effective than individual burns that would cover a smaller area, maupin said.susan said the second fire, in 2006, was a backfire started by steven to protect their property from lightening fires. there was fire all around them that was going to burn our house and all of our trees and everything. the opportunity to set a back-fire was there and it was very successful. it saved a bunch of land from burning, she remembers.the blm asserts that one acre of federal land was burned by the hammonds backfire and susan says determining which fire burned which land is a joke because fire burned from every direction.neighbor ruthie danielson also remembers that evening and agrees. lightening strikes were everywhere, fires were going off, she said.maupin said prescribed burns to manage juniper were common in the late 1990s and early 2000s, best done late in the fall when the days are cooler.prescribed burns on federal land in their area have all but stopped due to pressure from special interest groups, maupin said. as a result, wildfires now burn much hotter due to a ladder of material on the ground grass, brush and trees. the fires now burn really hot and they sterilize the ground. then you have a weed patch that comes back. maupin said planned burning in cooler weather like the hammonds chose to do improves the quality of the forage, and makes for better sage grouse habitat by removing juniper trees that suck up water and house raptors a sage grouse predator.// <![cdata[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getelementsbytagname(s)[0]; if (d.getelementbyid(id)) return; js = d.createelement(s); js.id = id; js.src =

russia hopes to agree on debt repayment with venezuela by year-end,"moscow (reuters) - the russian finance ministry wants to find a solution on how venezuela will fulfill its debt obligations to moscow by the end of this year, a senior ministry official said on friday. konstantin vyshkovsky, head of the state debt department at the finance ministry, told reuters that venezuela owed russia more than $3 billion. venezuela borrowed from russia in late 2011 but failed to keep up with payments on the debt in 2016 as the south american state faced a full-blown economic and financial crisis. for now we consider it to be a liquidity crisis but not a crisis of financial solvency, vyshkovsky said. vyshkovsky said that the finance ministry hoped to agree on new conditions for how caracas would honor the debt by the end of 2017. what the conditions would be like and how quickly we would find a compromise remains to be seen. but our partners speak about a strong desire to reach an agreement quickly, vyshkovsky said. vyshkovsky declined to say when he would expect caracas to pay back its debt. venezuela s unraveling socialist government is increasingly turning to ally russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive, according to a reuters special report published last month.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.081818181818182,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
arrested protester of baton rouge police shooting files suit - the new york times,"new orleans — deray mckesson is a prominent voice of the black lives matter movement who was arrested in july while protesting the fatal police shooting of a baton rouge man selling cds outside a convenience store. on thursday, he filed a proposed lawsuit against the city of baton rouge and several law enforcement agencies. the suit, in which mr. mckesson is joined as a named plaintiff by two other protesters who were also arrested, says that the police “employed unconstitutional tactics to disturb, disrupt, infringe upon and criminalize” the constitutional rights of assembly and free speech. mr. mckesson was arrested july 9, four days after the shooting of the man, alton sterling, and as demonstrations had been growing in baton rouge. the night he was arrested, on the grounds of “simple obstruction of a highway of commerce,” more than 100 people were also arrested, mostly on the same charge. mr. mckesson was held overnight and released the next day. about a week later, the parish prosecutor announced that he would drop charges against mr. mckesson and about 100 of the 185 people who had been arrested during the protests. like mr. mckesson, the two other named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, gloria la riva of san francisco and kira marrero of louisiana, were arrested on the charge, which was later dropped. the suit, which seeks to represent all those arrested on this charge during the july protests, demands the removal of the arrests from criminal records and the reimbursement of bond payments, lawyers’ fees and other costs paid by the plaintiffs. the defendants include mayor kip holden of baton rouge the city’s police chief, carl dabadie jr. the parish sheriff and the superintendent of the louisiana state police. a spokesman for the mayor’s office could not be reached for comment, and a baton rouge police department spokesman would not comment. mr. mckesson’s lawsuit followed another one concerning the baton rouge protests, by the american civil liberties union of louisiana. that suit seeks a court order to change the way police respond to protests. responding to the july protests, which were nearly all peaceful, officers in baton rouge wore riot gear, carried long guns and made arrests on private property. their tactics have drawn intense criticism, but city officials defended them, citing suspected violent plots against the police. on july 17, a former marine angered over police shootings traveled to baton rouge from missouri and shot six law enforcement officers, killing three.",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.633846153846157,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0
eu should enforce rules to prevent vetoes on tax reforms: juncker,"strasbourg (reuters) - tax reforms in the european union, such as higher taxation of online giants, should no longer require unanimous votes from eu ministers, the head of the european commission said on wednesday, urging the use of rules that limit governments veto powers. jean-claude juncker was speaking two days before eu finance ministers meet to discuss plans to introduce higher taxes on digital multinationals like google and amazon, which stand accused of paying too little tax in europe. he urged eu states to adopt tax reforms with a qualified majority rather than by unanimity, a practice that has so far blocked major overhauls of tax legislation in the 28-country bloc. his proposal would end the ability of a single country to veto such decisions at ministerial level, although national leaders would retain veto power at eu summits. if taken up, the idea could reduce the power of smaller states, which offer some of the most favorable tax rates for multinationals, to block reforms. juncker said it was possible under already existing rules to switch to majority voting in certain areas, and this should be applied to decisions on fair taxes of the digital industry . i want decisions in the council (of eu ministers) to be taken more often and more easily by qualified majority, juncker said. in separate remarks, the commissioner in charge of tax issues, pierre moscovici, said on wednesday that the eu executive will present a new initiative on digital taxation in the coming weeks. the simpler decision-making should also be used to decide on legislative proposals on value added tax (vat) and on a common consolidated corporate tax base, which would harmonize national rules on tax deductions, juncker said. he added that he also supported this solution for decisions on a european financial transactions tax, a long-running plan from which most eu states have opted out, but which remains under discussion among 10 euro zone countries. europe has to be able to act quicker and more decisively, juncker said in a speech to the european parliament in strasbourg, urging the use of so-called passerelle clauses to reduce countries veto powers. these provisions, included in the eu treaties, allow for simplified legislative procedures if eu leaders decide so unanimously, and if national parliaments do not oppose it. eu leaders, who usually meet every three months, tend to reach overall political agreements that are later translated into legislative acts by relevant ministers.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.936363636363637,4.4,0.0,0.0

report: trump denounces nuclear arms control treaty to putin - breitbart,"president donald trump in his first phone call with russian president vladimir putin denounced a treaty that caps u. s. and russian deployment of nuclear warheads, according to a report. [trump told putin that the treaty, known as new start, was one of several bad deals negotiated by the obama administration, according to a report by reuters. unnamed sources said that trump did not know what the treaty was, and had paused to ask his aides in an aside what it was, according to the report. white house press secretary sean spicer told reporters on thursday that trump understood the topic, but had wanted an opinion from an aide. “it wasn’t like he didn’t know what was being said. he wanted an opinion on something,” spicer said. the treaty requires russia and the united states to lower the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1, 550 or less by 2018. it also limits deployed and missiles, and bombers. in the phone call, putin suggested extending new start, which is set to expire in 2021, the sources told reuters. trump had criticized the treaty during a 2016 presidential debate, saying russia had “outsmarted” the u. s. with former secretary of state hillary clinton. critics view the agreement as requiring deep cuts in the u. s. nuclear arsenal and abandoning missile defense in europe. trump had also tweeted, as “the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. ” supporters of the treaty argue that the end of the treaty could lead to a new arms race. “new start has unquestionably made our country safer, an opinion widely shared by national security experts on both sides of the aisle,” democratic sen. jeanne shaheen (nh) said in a statement. a mutual agreement can extend the treaty’s provisions for another five years. the original agreement, known as start, was renewed in 2010 by obama, and went into effect in 2011, according to cnn. it aims to cut the number of nuclear weapons that the u. s. and russia could deploy by about . it would limit a maximum of 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarines and bombers, and a total of 1, 500 warheads.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.91,16.0,0.0,0.0
"trump shows amazing disrespect for media, brags about holding rally without his press corps","during presidential campaigns, it is pretty standard procedure for there to be a press corps that travels with the major party candidates. however, last night, donald trump s press corps was late getting to his rally. instead of doing what any normal, reasonable candidate would do and telling the crowd to wait patiently for the press to arrive, trump held the rally without them. they got there 3 minutes and 28 seconds before the rally ended. as if that weren t bad enough, trump actually bragged about snubbing the press, and mocked them for their travel issues: i have really good news for you. i just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane, they can t get here. i love it. they re trying to get here now, they re going to be about 30 minutes late. they called us and said, could you wait? i said, absolutely not, let s get going. the media members on twitter were not going to let trump and his campaign get off that easy, though. they took to trump s own favorite social media platform and slammed the trump campaign for allegedly screwing around with their travel situation, so that they would miss the rally. they also blasted the candidate himself for not having the same sort of official press pool that trump s democratic rival hillary clinton and, indeed, every presidential candidate in modern history prior to donald trump has. here are just a few of those tweets, via the hill:trump doing this rally without his traveling press corps even here is an absurd joke. phil mattingly (@phil_mattingly) september 16, 2016this week, conway said clinton treats the press like second class citizens. please note that trump is speaking right now and we are on a bus sopan deb (@sopandeb) september 16, 2016here's another view of trump's traveling press corps as trump is on stage in nh pic.twitter.com/xdiqifrl8m noah gray cnn (@noahgraycnn) september 16, 2016and now apparently he's on stage mocking the fact that he started without the press arriving. 2/2 https://t.co/kabvyvuack jeremy diamond (@jdiamond1) september 16, 2016the traveling trump press saw 3 minutes and 28 seconds of his rally in laconia. nick corasaniti (@nytnickc) september 16, 2016this is disgraceful, but hardly surprising. trump hates the press. in fact, he hates them so much that he has actually banned a multitude of media outlets from having press credentials to cover his rallies, just because he doesn t like what they have to say about him. this is just another new low for donald trump and his travesty of a campaign. hopefully, the media keeps hounding him, and treats him just as badly as he treats them.featured image via mark wallheiser/getty images",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.06666666666666667,10.098571428571429,14.171428571428573,0.0,0.0
u.s. military says will not disclose details on injured service members,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. military will not provide details on specific cases of american service members injured in iraq and syria because it could give information to islamic state militants, a pentagon spokesman said on tuesday the spokesman, peter cook, was responding to a question at a pentagon press briefing seeking confirmation that four americans had been wounded in syria earlier this month. cook said there had been no a change in policy and aggregate numbers would still be provided. “our policy is not to identify wounded service members for a variety of reasons, including operational security, including privacy reasons,” cook said. “also, we do not want to provide additional information to the enemy that might enhance their own assessment on the battlefield situation,” he said. however, the pentagon has released such information in the past and responded to queries, and it was unclear how cook’s comments were consistent with previous disclosures. last month a spokesman said two u.s. service member had been injured, one each in iraq and syria, during the last weekend in may. captain jeff davis said the incident in iraq took place in the north, near erbil, while the injury in syria was north of raqqa, islamic state’s de facto capital. according to pentagon data, there have been 16 american service members wounded in action since the start of operation inherent resolve, the military’s name for an operation targeting islamic state militants in iraq and syria which started in 2014. cook’s comments came the same day that president barack obama visited walter reed national military medical center; he has visited wounded u.s. service members there throughout his presidency.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.081818181818182,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0
where are the mass media firings and resignations?,"*articles of the bound* / where are the mass media firings and resignations? where are the mass media firings and resignations? november 12, 2016, 5:56 am by cliff kincaid leave a comment 0 accuracy in media i missed a few losers in my column on the big media losers of the 2016 campaign. one person told me, “bret stephens of the wall street journal has totally lost all credibility with his anti-trump rants in his weekly column right up to the very end. we used to be ardent fans of his, but no more!!!” i agree that stephens is a big loser. his attacks on trump were relentless and he declared that he wanted to build a new political party to compete with trump. sounding like the huffington post, stephens used his november 8 column to find trump guilty of “unrelenting and apparently irrepressible bigotry, misogyny, bullying and conspiracy-mongering…” after the election, his readers responded with comments like: you are fired! deep breaths bret. you’ll be ok. msnbc has several openings on their jobs page, bret. stephens, you have climbed out on a limb and sawed it off. best way to handle stephens is to not read his columns anymore. that’s my solution to george will also. eventually, they will be fired. speaking of the huffington post, consider these post-election headlines from the online publication: “why huffpost’s presidential forecast didn’t see a donald trump win coming. here’s how we blew it and what we’re doing to prevent a repeat.” but no resignations or firings were announced, and stephens will also apparently keep his job. journalists and columnists should not be fired for their opinions, but for their lack of objectivity. it’s fine to have anti-trump opinions, but that should not have interfered with an analysis of why trump was striking a chord with the american people. my own views of trump changed as i saw how the people were responding to him. one good source was right side broadcasting , which aired live coverage of trump rallies. their broadcasts captured the size of the crowds. i saw trump’s appearance in the heavily-democratic city of toledo, ohio, where he was greeted by enthusiasm. i also took trips to states like pennsylvania and saw the dozens of “trump for president” signs. my july 29 column, “ democrats abandon workers to trump ,” looked at how the democratic party had abandoned the working class. my column on the eve of the election examined how “people power” could guarantee a trump victory. these trump supporters were not serial liars, rampant xenophobes, racists, misogynists, etc. they were ordinary people who were sick and tired of the liberal establishment. by contrast, the elitist bret stephens wrote about the trump rallies, “the fervor of his crowds recalls nasser’s egypt.” stephens had nothing but contempt for the average american. the problem with people like stephens and publications like the huffington post is that they let their anti-trump orientation interfere with the need for a professional analysis of what was actually happening in america’s cities and towns. one huffington post writer with egg on his face is ryan grim, who was promoting the bogus story that trump had raped a 13-year-old girl. regarding the rape story, grim informed his readers on november 2 that “a woman who says trump raped her as a 13-year-old in the 1990s is planning a press conference at 6:00 est today. i coincidentally was working on a piece explaining why this case has gotten so little coverage.” it got little coverage because it was false. the woman, who had a history of drug abuse, pulled out of the news conference. she was identified by name and dropped the lawsuit. the allegations were obviously fabricated. grim also promoted the publication’s inaccurate predictions, saying on november 8, “our final forecast is that she’ll [hillary will] win 323 electoral votes, far more than the 270 she needs to win. according to our model, she’ll win florida, north carolina and new hampshire, and that’ll be that. early night.” the story by natalie jackson of the huffington post about how the publication totally botched coverage of the campaign admits the magnitude of the mistake: “our model predicted that democrat hillary clinton had a 98 percent chance of being elected. that was more pro-clinton than most other forecast models (although all of them predicted a clinton win). our model said five senate seats would shift from republican to democratic, giving democrats a likely majority.” but nobody in the media loses their jobs for getting the facts wrong and doing their work in an unprofessional manner. what’s more, we see the same left-wing pundits and reporters on networks like cnn coming back for more, giving viewers more slanted coverage and commentary disguised as news. consider “former” communist van jones using cnn to accuse trump supporters of being white racists. the same old liberal talking heads are currently trying to dictate the make-up of trump’s cabinet and staff by warning against certain people deemed too conservative or “controversial.” james o’keefe of project veritas comments that millions overcame “the firewall that existed within the media.” that partly occurred because of his undercover videos that led to resignations by democratic operatives. in a post-election video , he explained that the most stunning admission of election night was “the power shift in this country,” as citizens exercised their power, “despite the overwhelming forces working them against them.” we can see that, as a result of the media’s failure to clean house, those who opposed trump will not give up their power. since they have shown that they have no professional standards, the only answer is to further drain the media elite of viewers and readers, and build up the power of alternative sources of news and information. any ordinary business that got things so wrong and performed so incompetently would go out of business. let’s help the liberal media bite the dust. cliff kincaid cliff kincaid is the director of the aim center for investigative journalism

"ivanka’s rabbi breaks ranks, roundly condemns trump on charlottesville","donald trump expects unwavering loyalty from everyone around him. that is likely why there has been radio silence from his daughter ivanka, who is a jewish convert, and his son-in-law jared kushner, who is a genetic jew. trump s grandchildren are jewish as well, of course. however, that did not stop him from defending the white nationalists, neo-nazis, hitler sympathizers, and other assorted racists who marched with torches through the streets of charlottesville, virginia shouting racist and anti-semitic slogans.therefore, it should come as no surprise that the rabbi who helped ivanka convert to judaism is not impressed. in fact, he seems to be quite outraged. rabbi emeritus haskel lookstein is beside himself with rage at trump s response to the charlottesville tragedy, and rightly so. he wrote a letter condemning trump s remarks, saying: we are appalled by this resurgence of bigotry and antisemitism, and the renewed vigor of the neo-nazis, kkk, and alt-right. while we avoid politics, we are deeply troubled by the moral equivalency and equivocation president trump has offered in his response to this act of violence. rabbi lookstein released the letter publicly, and likely will be attacked by trump. the divider-in-chief may have done the unthinkable with this one and divided his own family. ivanka and jared take their faith very seriously, and ivanka has been a devout jew since 2010 and is raising her children in a seriously observant jewish home. they likely already have a hard time working in trump s white house, which is chock full of open racists, neo-nazis, and anti-semites. jared has family members who died in the nazi holocaust. there is simply no way, he is happy with trump s equating white supremacists with those fighting against that kind of hate.this is especially evident considering the fact that ivanka immediately denounced the hate and called the groups perpetuating it out by name in ways her father has repeatedly refused to do.ivanka and jared, do you really want your jewish children growing up in this environment? loyalty to your nazi father simply is not worth it. take a stand and resign from his white house.featured image via sean gallup/getty images",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.2755555555555596,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0

watch: bill maher hilariously mocks libertarians to their presidential nominee’s face,"on friday, during an interview on real time with bill maher, libertarian party presidential nominee gary johnson sat down with bill maher and tried to make the case for a libertarian president. maher brutally mocked johnson and his party s economic beliefs saying that their economic theory is like mad max takes your gas and you die. the libertarian party would be more aptly named the neoliberalist party. they are both radically conservative on economic issues and radically liberal on social issues. as maher described their views on government saying, i saw your convention. the vision of government is somewhere between colonial williamsburg and atlantis. both maher and johnson cited examples of some of the more unorthodox views some people hold within the libertarian party. johnson mentioned that he was booed at the libertarian national convention for stating that he believes that people should be required to get a driver s license in order for them to be able to drive. maher mentions that the question as to whether 5-year-olds should be able to purchase heroin legally is a major debate between libertarians.as nutty as that sounds, johnson insists that here are extremists and loons in every party, while posturing himself as an alternative to people who might be voting for the presumptive republican nominee this november. johnson insists that he is the best non-major party candidate to take votes away from trump due to his predicted status of being on the ballot in all fifty states in the 2016 general election.the left has fervently hoped that a serious non-major candidate would run against trump in the general election. with republicans begrudgingly beginning to rally around trump, it is looking more unlikely that either a serious or protest candidate backing a moderately conservative agenda will come from the republican party.whether johnson can run a serious campaign in november will mostly be determined by whether he can make his way into the debates. candidates must be polling at 15% in order to make it into the debates. johnson is currently polling at 10%. it s unlikely that johnson is going to reach the necessary threshold to join the debates. that being said, he does seem like a reasonable choice for conservatives who cannot hold their nose to vote for hillary clinton and are adamantly a part of the #nevertrump camp.you can watch the interview below, in full.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rk3idl8ry8featured image from video screenshot",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.07692307692307693,14.445454545454545,18.94545454545455,0.0,0.0

executive actions ready to go as trump prepares to take office,"washington (reuters) - donald trump is preparing to sign executive actions on his first day in the white house on friday to take the opening steps to crack down on immigration, build a wall on the u.s.-mexican border and roll back outgoing president barack obama’s policies. trump, a republican elected on nov. 8 to succeed democrat obama, arrived in washington on a military plane with his family a day before he will be sworn in during a ceremony at the u.s. capitol. aides said trump would not wait to wield one of the most powerful tools of his office, the presidential pen, to sign several executive actions that can be implemented without the input of congress. “he is committed to not just day 1, but day 2, day 3 of enacting an agenda of real change, and i think that you’re going to see that in the days and weeks to come,” trump spokesman sean spicer said on thursday, telling reporters to expect activity on friday, during the weekend and early next week. more from reuters * trumponomics may be wrong medicine for u.s. economy today * graphic: the presidential touch on markets * politics live: latest on trump's inauguration trump plans on saturday to visit the headquarters of the cia in langley, virginia. he has harshly criticized the agency and its outgoing chief, first questioning the cia’s conclusion that russia was involved in cyber hacking during the u.s. election campaign, before later accepting the verdict. trump also likened u.s. intelligence agencies to nazi germany. trump’s advisers vetted more than 200 potential executive orders for him to consider signing on healthcare, climate policy, immigration, energy and numerous other issues, but it was not clear how many orders he would initially approve, according to a member of the trump transition team who was not authorized to talk to the press. signing off on orders puts trump, who has presided over a sprawling business empire but has never before held public office, in a familiar place similar to the ceo role that made him famous, and will give him some early victories before he has to turn to the lumbering process of getting congress to pass bills. the strategy has been used by other presidents, including obama, in their first few weeks in office. “he wants to show he will take action and not be stifled by washington gridlock,” said princeton university presidential historian julian zelizer. trump is expected to impose a federal hiring freeze and take steps to delay a labor department rule due to take effect in april that would require brokers who give retirement advice to put their clients’ best interests first. he also will give official notice he plans to withdraw from the 12-nation trans-pacific partnership trade deal and renegotiate the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico, spicer said. “i think you will see those happen very shortly,” spicer said. obama, ending eight years as president, made frequent use of his executive powers during his second term in office, when the republican-controlled congress stymied his efforts to overhaul immigration and environmental laws. many of those actions are now ripe targets for trump to reverse. trump is expected to sign an executive order in his first few days to direct the building of a wall on the southern border with mexico, and actions to limit the entry of asylum seekers from latin america, among several immigration-related steps his advisers have recommended. that includes rescinding obama’s order that allowed more than 700,000 people brought into the united states illegally as children to stay in the country on a two-year authorization to work and attend college, according to several people close to the presidential transition team. it is unlikely trump’s order will result in an immediate roundup of these immigrants, sources told reuters. rather, he is expected to let the authorizations expire. the issue could set up a confrontation with obama, who told reporters on wednesday he would weigh in if he felt the new administration was unfairly targeting those immigrants. advisers to trump expect him to put restrictions on people entering the united states from certain countries until a system for “extreme vetting” for islamist extremists can be set up. during his presidential campaign, trump proposed banning non-american muslims from entering the united states, but his executive order regarding immigration is expected to be based on nationality rather than religion. another proposed executive order would require all cabinet departments to disclose and pause current work being done in connection with obama’s initiatives to curb carbon emissions to combat climate change. trump also is expected to extend prohibitions on future lobbying imposed on members of his transition team. washington was turned into a virtual fortress ahead of the inauguration, with police ready to step in to separate protesters from trump supporters at any sign of unrest. as obama packed up to leave the white house, trump and his family laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in arlington national cemetery and attended a concert at the lincoln memorial. trump spoke earlier to lawmakers and cabinet nominees at a luncheon in a ballroom at his hotel, down the street from the white house, announcing during brief remarks that he would pick woody johnson, owner of the new york jets of the national football league, as u.s. ambassador to britain. “we have a lot of smart people. i tell you what, one thing we’ve learned, we have by far the highest iq of any cabinet ever assembled,” trump said. trump has selected all 21 members of his cabinet, along with six other key positions requiring senate confirmation. the senate is expected on friday to vote to confirm retired general james mattis, trump’s pick to lead the pentagon, and retired general john kelly, his homeland security choice. senate republicans had hoped to confirm as many as seven cabinet members on friday, but democrats balked at the pace. trump spokesman spicer accused senate democrats of “stalling tactics.” also in place for monday will be 536 “beachhead team members” at government agencies, vice president-elect mike pence said, a small portion of the thousands of positions obama’s appointees will vacate. trump has asked 50 obama staffers in critical posts to stay on until replacements can be found, including deputy defense secretary robert work and brett mcgurk, envoy to the u.s.-led coalition fighting islamic state. the list includes adam szubin, who has long served in an “acting” capacity in the treasury department’s top anti-terrorism job because his nomination has been held up by congressional republicans since obama named him to the job in april 2015. the supreme court said u.s. chief justice john roberts, who will administer the oath of office on friday, met with trump on thursday to discuss inauguration arrangements.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0
twitter destroys trump after he whines that eric can’t sell access to his administration (tweets),"in case you haven t heard, eric trump recently had to cancel an auction in which he was using his charity as a front to sell access to his father s administration. recently the eric trump foundation announced an auction for coffee with his sister, incoming first lady ivanka, who will be serving as an adviser to her father and occupying the space in the white house normally reserved for the president s spouse.to any casual onlooker, this is exactly the sort of situation that used to cause trump to scream lock her up, but now that he s president, the obvious conflict of interest presented by the sale of access to those closest to the president-elect doesn t matter much to him. on friday, the donald took to twitter to whine that his family can t sell access to his administration:my wonderful son, eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) december 23, 2016my presidency. isn't this a ridiculous shame? he loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. wrong answer! donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) december 23, 2016now, nothing is stopping any of the trumps from donating their own money, or encouraging direct donations to st. jude, the organization that was allegedly going to receive the money (anytime the trumps and charity are mentioned, allegedly is appropriate until it actually happens). but for them to think it is in any way ok to sell access to ivanka no matter the reason is just asinine. it s conflicts like this that caused obama to prohibit members of his family from directly raising money for anyone, no matter the cause:the obama administration prohibited any member of the first family from directly soliciting charitable donations, said norm eisen, who served as an ethics lawyer early in president obama s tenure. mr. obama and his wife, michelle, have attended occasional charitable fund-raising events, including the congressional black caucus annual dinners. the obamas also allowed their daughters high school to auction off magazines they had signed, mr. eisen said, but they did not auction off access to themselves. you never, ever want to have government officials using their public office for the private gain, even for a worthy charity, mr. eisen said. that was how we did it. eric trump, like his father, whined that he can t raise money by selling his sister despite getting by just fine without that sort of thing in the past. i get that people will try to use anything they can for their own interests, trump said. the reality is, i ve been raising money for sick kids far longer than his dad has been involved in politics, eric trump told the new york times, though he did explain that he understands the quagmire presented by what he had hoped he would not get caught doing.naturally, in what is almost becoming a daily ritual, twitter swarmed trump s morning bloviating whinefest and once again hammered him into oblivion:@realdonaldtrump sorry your children can't get the tax deduction on your name. but people should donate directly to st. jude. tony posnanski (@tonyposnanski) december 23, 2016@realdonaldtrump remember when you used trump foundation money to buy a big picture of yourself?

osama bin laden’s youngest wife speaks out for first time: tells chaotic story of night u.s. navy seals killed her “frightened” husband,"the family of osama bin laden has spoken out for the first time about what it was like to watch the 9/11 mastermind and al-qaeda terrorist die in a hail of us military gunfire.amal bin laden, the fourth and youngest wife of the man who was at the top of the us s most wanted list for over a decade, has recounted the story of the night he died at the hands of seal special forces.she and their six children lived in their safe house in the mountains of abbottabad in pakistan when bin ladin was killed on may 11, 2011.amal bin laden told the story of the night to cathy scott-clarke and adrian levy for their book the exile: the flight of osama bin laden, which has been excerpted in the sunday times uk.along with amal bin laden and her children, also living in the house was bin laden s second wife khairiah and third wife seham and son khalid, 22.first wife najwa had married him as a teen and bore him 11 children, but left him two days before the 9/11 attacks.by 11pm on may 1, 2011, after dinner, the dishes, and prayer, bin laden was fast asleep while his fourth wife lie next to him.outside, the streets were dark due to an electricity shortage, something that was a common occurrence in the area, but amal awoke uneasily just past midnight.she heard a chop chop chop sound and thought she saw shadows dancing on the windows.bin laden sat up, looking frightened. americans are coming, he said, panting. then there was a loud screeching noise and the house rocked.the pair clutched at each other and crept to the balcony. it was a moonless night and difficult to see, amal said.on the lawn, out of their sight, were two us military black hawks, and 24 seals were stealthily rushing over the lawn and towards the compound.up on the second floor balcony, seham and khalid could see the americans approaching.bin laden called to his son to come to him and, still in his pajamas, khalid grabbed an ak-47, which amal knew he hadn t fired since he was 13.amal and seham comforted the children, who were crying. they all went to the top floor and huddled.they heard a blast as the seals blew off the gate to the house. they want me, not you, bin laden finally said, telling his family to go downstairs. but oldest daughters miriam and sumaiya hid on the balcony while seham and son khalid went downstairs.upstairs, amal, bin laden and their young son hussein remained in the room and prayed. amal said she realized someone within their inner circle had betrayed them.the seals were now in a hallway and blasted a locked door before heading upwards.one of the forces members, who spoke arabic and knew what khalid looked like, called to him, and when khalid glanced over the balcony, he was shot.sumaiya and miriam rushed the seals but they were quickly flicked against a wall by the arabic-speaking man.seal robert o neill walked past them and entered the room. amal was in front of her husband. she rushed o neill and was shot by someone as other seals entered the room.amal felt pain tear through her leg and she collapsed onto the bed and passed out.o neill would later describe shooting bin laden, and thinking he s going down .more seals crashed into the room and fired rounds into bin laden.meanwhile, amal said she awoke but knew she had to play dead. she closed her eyes and tried to slow her breathing.little hussein, who had witnessed everything, was grabbed by a seal, and water was thrown in his face, according to amal.she remained motionless as miram and sumaiya were grabbed by the forces and held over the bodies of their father, and voices demanded that they make an identification.at first miriam gave a fake name, but sumaiya said tell them the truth, they are not pakastanis . my father, miriam said. osama bin laden. safiyah, then 11, was hiding on the balcony when he was also grabbed by a seal and told to make an identification. safiyah was crying hysterically but told the men it was her father.khairiah, who was in the hallway, was also grabbed by a seal. stop f***ing with me, the seal yelled, according to the account. who s that? osama, she murmured. for entire story: daily mailnavy seal robert o neill who tells his story of how they found and how he killed osama bin laden to fox news here:",1,22,0.0,0,0,0,0.037037037037037035,5.327272727272728,8.036363636363637,0.045454545454545456,0.0

attorney general sessions brushes off trump criticism,"washington (reuters) - u.s. attorney general jeff sessions on thursday brushed off sharp criticism from president donald trump over his recusal from the justice department’s russia investigation, saying he loved his job and planned to continue serving. “we love this job, we love this department, and i plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate,” sessions said at a news conference announcing a cyber crime bust. sessions was flanked by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and acting federal bureau of investigation director andrew mccabe, who were both also criticized by the president in an interview with the new york times on wednesday. trump took a broad swipe at his administration’s top law officers in the interview, saying he would not have appointed sessions as attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself. the republican president also noted rosenstein’s connection to democratic baltimore and that mccabe’s wife took money from a leading democrat during a political campaign. the public lashing came after a turbulent first six months in office during which trump fired national security adviser michael flynn and fbi director james comey, then the top official leading the probe into whether russian meddled in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties to the trump campaign. sessions recused himself in march from the russia criminal investigation. he did so after failing to disclose at his confirmation hearing that he had held meetings last year with russia’s ambassador. “sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and i would have picked somebody else,” the times quoted trump as saying. white house spokesman sarah sanders said later on thursday that, while trump was disappointed in the recusal, “clearly he has confidence in him or he would not be the attorney general.” sessions was trump’s first supporter in the u.s. senate and helped shape his political team throughout the campaign and into the transition after the nov. 8 election. he declined on thursday to acknowledge trump’s criticism. “i have the honor of serving as attorney general. it’s something that goes beyond any thought i would have ever had for myself,” sessions said. similarly, rosenstein declined to comment when asked about trump’s remarks that there were very few republicans in baltimore, where he was a former federal prosecutor. “i was proud to be here yesterday, i’m proud to be here today, i’ll be proud to work here tomorrow,” he said. they took only a few questions before a spokesman asked if there were any questions about the department’s dismantlement of alphabay, a “dark web” market. seeing no hands, sessions left as reporters shouted questions about whether he would resign. an aide to sessions said the recent disparaging remarks from trump are “nothing new,” given news media reports last month that the president was upset with the attorney general over the russia recusal. a federal special counsel has been appointed to take over the russia investigation, and several congressional committees are conducting probes. next week, trump’s son-in-law and white house adviser, jared kushner, and the president’s eldest son, donald trump jr., are scheduled to testify before senate panels, as well as former trump campaign manager paul manafort. the kremlin says it did not interfere in the election, and trump has denied any collusion. in the times interview, the president also took aim at the special counsel appointed to take over the russia investigation, robert mueller, saying mueller would be crossing a “red line” if he began investigating trump’s personal finances. “i think that’s a violation. look, this is about russia,” trump told the times. at the white house, sanders said trump has no intention of firing mueller at this time. the times also reported on wednesday that deutsche bank ag (dbkgn.de) has been in contact with federal investigators about trump’s accounts, citing two people briefed on the matter. and the bank was expecting to eventually have to provide information to mueller, they said. deutsche bank, which has loaned the trump organization family business millions of dollars for real-estate ventures, late last month rejected demands by democratic lawmakers in the u.s. house of representatives to provide details of trump’s finances, citing privacy laws. on capitol hill, the senate judiciary committee approved trump’s pick to replace comey at the fbi, christopher wray. the full senate was expected to confirm wray before its august recess. democratic senator dick durbin said at the hearing that trump’s latest comments raised troubling questions about the independence and credibility of the justice department. “now what happens next as members close to the president, his own administration, and his family are being asked critical questions?” durbin asked. “we have to make it clear that no one in this country, including the president of the united states, is above the

(reuters) - the california public employees’ retirement system (calpers) on monday said it was considering making direct investments in private companies, a potential major shift in strategy that would be the first such action by a u.s. public pension fund. the change, discussed at a meeting of calpers board in monterey, would be closely watched by other u.s. public pensions as they look to improve returns on their investments, in part by cutting fees. the $323 billion pension fund, the largest in the country and a trend setter, has been under increasing pressure to achieve returns closer to the fund’s assumed rate of return of 7 percent by 2020. in the fiscal year ended june 30, private equity investment returned 13.9 percent, the second best performer behind public equities, or stock portfolio. the asset class helped to boost the fund’s total year-end returns to 11.2 percent, exceeding expectations for the first time since 2014. private equity has been calpers’ best performing asset class in the past two decades and accounts for about $26 billion of its portfolio. but calpers mainly invests in private equity funds and has been criticized for accepting the high fees and limited disclosures typically associated with the asset class. the shift in strategy, if adopted, is likely to require a considerable investment in staff and expertise in the years ahead to handle the strategic shift. calpers chief investment officer ted eliopoulos told reuters he would recommend calpers “explore setting up a separate vehicle” for direct investments and expand the current co-investment program. eliopoulos suggested calpers focus on opportunities that do not compete with its current private equity investments, such as owning companies for longer than 10 years, and investing in technology and life science companies. “calpers has a unique opportunity to be a leader in the co-investment space,” sandra horbach, u.s. buyouts co-head at the carlyle group, told the board on monday. calpers’ massive size would make it a formidable player and allow the fund to dictate some investment terms, horbach said. most u.s.-based funds shy away from such investments, while canadian pension funds are considered leaders in the strategy. by its own account, calpers has developed somewhat of a negative image among private equity firms as being difficult to work with and slow to make decisions, john cole, calpers investment director, told the board at monday’s meeting. a number of funds “have told us that we have become too unpredictable to do business with, and many larger general partners are cutting back the amounts that they are willing to allocate to us in their new funds”, cole said.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.080000000000002,18.2,0.0,0.0
"after a breakup, an app to help breathe, then run - the new york times","“when was the last time you breathed properly?” the therapist asked me. his name was allan. thirty minutes into my first visit, i was still waiting for him to reach the part where he would help me get over the end of my relationship. “i’m not sure what you mean,” i said. “easy, open breathing. big lungfuls of air. ” “i don’t know,” i said. “i breathe all the time. ” i tried steering the conversation myself. “i just think i need to work out what happened — — ” “i’m not interested in what happened,” he said. “i’m interested in the last time you breathed normally. you’re a young, healthy woman. but your paperwork tells me you’re struggling at work, haven’t eaten a full meal in weeks and can’t sleep. you need to fix that. ” i thought therapy would help convince me that the loss of the person i had been devoted to for years was a good thing. instead, something in allan’s blunt insistence on the symptoms and not the cause had put me on my heels. he peered over his notepad. “you’re all hunched up,” he said. “you look miserable. your homework for next week is to do the exercises i’ll email you. you’ve got six sessions, and i want you breathing and sleeping properly by the end of it. ” cycling home afterward, i had already dismissed allan’s words and returned to my regular programming: raking through the seven years since i had met my ex, mining memories for details of where it went wrong. we had started with two years of silent longing (me) and dating other people (him) before finally feeling our way into a life and home together in london. until one painful, protracted summer, he left. i had always prided myself on being strong, on being able to bounce back, but here i was, months later, wrestling with questions without answers at night and awakening to a frightening bleakness. lying awake that evening, i wondered if i was making a mistake in outsourcing my problems. allan’s focus on breathing sounded suspiciously like mindfulness to me. i had another long night ahead, though, so i groped around the bedsheets for my phone, and that’s when i saw his promised email. “download the app in the link below,” it read. “when you use it, imagine a place you feel happy and safe. hold that image in your mind. then focus on your breathing. use the app each night before you go to sleep. exercise. ” my mind cast around for the prescribed happy place, settling on a pebble beach on the south coast of england where i had spent childhood summers. i tried to remember its hard, smooth stones, the sounds of my brother yelling from the sea. the app, positivity with andrew johnson, started. in a scottish burr, a man counted down from 10. with a twinge of curiosity, i tried breathing in. allan had a point: my chest was tight with tension. i attempted to push the air down, and my tummy distended like a child’s. as i tried to synchronize my breathing, the vision of the beach kept escaping and then reappearing, interrupted by jags of thought. still, i kept trying every night. learning how to breathe was at least something different, a quick break from analyzing my own love story with exhausting precision. when i visited allan a few weeks later, our conversation turned to intuition. “what does your gut tell you about what you should be doing?” he asked. “my gut?” i felt embarrassed. “i don’t feel anything in there. ” i looked down hopefully at my stomach. privately, i had always wondered what people meant by intuition. “you mentioned that you were nervous, that you often experienced anxiety from the start of the year,” he said. “why do you think that was?” i have always relied on the flush of adrenaline to get stuff done. yet a deeper, more frantic energy than usual had seeped in during the months before my boyfriend left. this tension pushed the vacuum cleaner faster round the living room and infused the meals i had started to make from cookbooks. our apartment had never looked so tidy. on rainy sundays, i urged him to make plans for a trip to paris, which he wasn’t keen on. “i find it hard to believe that my body knew something was up before my brain did,” i said, petulance creeping into my voice. “intuition is a sense developed from your past experiences, books you’ve read, sounds on the street, conversations, facial expressions,” allan said. “all valuable information. it can help you to distinguish between what is real and what is fake, to notice something dangerous. perhaps you trust your thoughts more, though. ” “thoughts are all i have, surely,” i said. “that’s where all that information ends up getting used. ” “there’s plenty of research that would disagree with you. why not try listening to your body instead of your head? that’s where all your feelings have been coming from. ” feelings. we hadn’t talked about feelings at all. but as the weeks passed, i found that painful emotions, long ossified and remote, began overtaking me in humiliating ways. tears streamed down my face in supermarkets my shoulders heaved silently on family car trips. my feelings were like the drunk who shows up too late to the party, misjudging the mood. yet it was a strange relief to find i was capable of them. the tears were new, and they felt animal. salt burned a rash around my eyelids in a way that i suspected wasn’t entirely about the end of a relationship. the breakup had done something else: it had caused a crack, and the breathing only seemed to be making it wider. earlier, secrets and disasters found the fissure and out they came, noisily, messily. they had been quiet for years, but now they wanted water and air. in allan’s company, i seemed to spend increasing amounts of time feeling like an idiot. “i’m not trying to be difficult — — ” he suddenly sounded kind. “i don’t think you are,” he said. “but deep down, people often know when something is coming. when something has to change. ” the last time i spoke to allan was on the phone i had work i couldn’t get out of. he was as unrepentantly to the point as ever. “it’s fine,” he said as i apologized. “you’ll be fine. but i wanted to say, if your comes back, think seriously. good luck. and don’t forget to fill in the feedback form. ” later that day, from across my office desk, my phone pinged. it was a message from my ex: “do you want to meet up? i’d like to speak to you. ” how had allan foreseen that? the old love drew me back in, even when reduced to digital form. “when?” i replied. “where do you want to meet up?” a few days later, after an evening of stilted small talk in a pub, we stood together on a london street streaming with people. it was a sharp, clear november night. i felt blindsided. ten minutes earlier he had stared cryptically into my face and said: “i think we should try again. i miss you. ” words i had been willing him to say. “i understand this is a surprise,” he said. “i’ll wait for you to decide. ” “i don’t know what to say,” i mumbled. but then there was the beach. i had found that the more time i spent imagining that beach, the better i felt, the more i noticed things. that afternoon, for example, i had enjoyed how the cold air smelled of bonfires. even now, flooded with fear, i had briefly thought how cheerful the city’s scarlet buses looked as they slid past in the dark. i could see him waiting for a response, but i stood dumb. the traffic roared and i could feel my feet vibrating with the pavement. cold wind brushed past, goading me. it was all in league with a new, internal voice, one that spoke quietly and unexpectedly. “leave him,” it said. “take what you have and run. ” so with hardly a word, i turned and ran for the bus. that was a couple of years ago. allan gave me no cure for heartbreak, but he did teach me some things. to look after my body, to pay it respect. to question my mind, which doesn’t understand half as much as it thinks it does. to understand that the time spent in the gap between the endless stories we tell ourselves is the present. these days, i care more about being peaceful and happy than about being in love. i’m not sure love is love if it consumes you, if it dominates your thoughts. perhaps that’s something else: obsession, limerence. while it’s a trip to get lost in a relationship, finding yourself again can prove and costly. but breathing freely, feeling alert to the world and being in touch with your emotions? just $2. 99 at the app store. and a lot of work. next i’d like to try having love and happiness at the same time, though. i’ve heard it’s possible.",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.355714285714285,5.6000000000000005,0.0,0.0

the truth about apple vs the us government…and why americans should care who wins,"americans need to know the truth about apple and what the government is asking them to do. they need to know what apple has already agreed to do for the incompetent government. this article spells it all out before we get into too much detail about the apple vs us government dispute, we thought it was important to share with you a letter from apple ceo tim cook to their customers:february 16, 2016 the united states government has demanded that apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. we oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.this moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.smartphones, led by iphone, have become an essential part of our lives. people use them to store an incredible amount of personal information, from our private conversations to our photos, our music, our notes, our calendars and contacts, our financial information and health data, even where we have been and where we are going.all that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission. customers expect apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data.compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. that is why encryption has become so important to all of us.for many years, we have used encryption to protect our customers personal data because we believe it s the only way to keep their information safe. we have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iphone are none of our business.we were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in san bernardino last december. we mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. the fbi asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the government s efforts to solve this horrible crime. we have no sympathy for terrorists.when the fbi has requested data that s in our possession, we have provided it. apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the san bernardino case. we have also made apple engineers available to advise the fbi, and we ve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal.we have great respect for the professionals at the fbi, and we believe their intentions are good. up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. but now the u.s. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. they have asked us to build a backdoor to the iphone.specifically, the fbi wants us to make a new version of the iphone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iphone recovered during the investigation. in the wrong hands, this software which does not exist today would have the potential to unlock any iphone in someone s physical possession.the fbi may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: building a version of ios that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. and while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.some would argue that building a backdoor for just one iphone is a simple, clean-cut solution. but it ignores both the basics of digital security and the significance of what the government is demanding in this case.in today s digital world, the key to an encrypted system is a piece of information that unlocks the data, and it is only as secure as the protections around it. once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge.the government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. but that s simply not true. once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. in the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. no reasonable person would find that acceptable.the government is asking apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers including tens of millions of american citizens from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. the same engineers who built strong encryption into the iphone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe.we can find no precedent for an american company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. for years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. doing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like apple to protect their data. criminals and bad actors will still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them.rather than asking for legislative action through congress, the fbi is proposing an unprecedented use of the all writs act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority.the government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. this would make it easier to unlock an iphone by brute force, trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.the implications of the government s demands are chilling. if the government can use the all writs act to make it easier to unlock your iphone, it would have the power to reach into anyone s device to capture their data. the government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone s microphone or camera without your knowledge.opposing this order is not something we take lightly. we feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the u.s. government.we are challenging the fbi s demands with the deepest respect for american democracy and a love of our country. we believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.while we believe the fbi s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. and ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.tim cook, apple ceorush limbaugh explains how our incompetent government is responsible for the mess in which they find themselves: the terrorists phones were not owned by the terrorist. mr. syed farook skyhook did not own his phone. san bernardino county owned the phone.do you know that over the weekend we learned the fbi told san bernardino to change the password on this phone? they thought that they would be able to find out information if they changed the well, not the password. the apple id password. it s just it s an absolute mess. nobody knows what s going on or how to use these things.since san bernardino county owned the phone, they could have had total control over it. if you are a business right now and you deploy iphones and i m gonna stick with iphones in this case cause that s what i know, but it s true of any others. if you re a small business, a corporation, and you provide phones for your employees and you own those phones, there is something called digital device management. it is software that allows you to control everything on their phone.you can put restrictions on what they can do with it. you can put restrictions on which apps work and which apps won t. in other words, you can stop them from using the phone personally. in addition to that, you, because you own the phone, have the ability to erase it at any time and find out what s on it. you can reset the pass code yourself as the owner of the phone. you can do it with four clicks.if the people in san bernardino county had ever taken the time to find out what they could do with the phones that they were giving to employees, if they had just taken the time to have somebody come in and teach them, we wouldn t be here. because there already is a way for the fbi and san bernardino to get what they want in the circumstance where somebody s using a phone owned by a business: it s called mdm. mobile device management. and in the case of apple, it s free. other software, $4 a phone is what it averages out but with os x server which is simply what you would need. it s an app, a server operating system. you can deploy all you have to do is set up the profiles for the phones that you want that are under your management. this is why you have an it guy. it s why you hire one. and there is a specific opportunity for owners of phones in this like san bernardino county, they could have gone in.it costs about $4 per phone and you have your it manager research it and learn how to operate it, and you control and manage every phone that you deploy, remotely. you don t have to have it in your possession to set up these restrictions. it just has to be signed in to the proper id, apple id, and whatever other identification systems a company uses.the moment this incident happened, they could have locked farook and whoever out of the phone, anybody else, and only allowed themselves in. they could have gone in, they could have gotten every bit of data they wanted off that phone via a backup or a dump. they could have changed the password themselves. they could have done any number of these things. but they didn t know they could. they had no idea. and i ll wager that 95% of companies or organizations that give away phones or provide them for businesses have no clue about any of this.apple doesn t need to add anything, and the fbi doesn t need to have apple rewrite software for all of us because what they want exists in a large number of circumstances and did exist in this san bernardino situation. but i m sure the people at san bernardino were clueless and had no idea how to do this. they even confused the passcode to unlock phone and the passport for the apple id connecting the phone to icloud. they got confused over that. they literally had no idea what they were doing. it s stunning what they did not know.",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.255714285714287,11.314285714285715,0.07142857142857142,0.07142857142857142
barack obama’s nsa susan rice ordered spies to provide “detailed spreadsheets” of trump calls…”that’s a felony”…brother of cbs news president also involved [video],"while obama hangs out in tahiti, his nsa director susan rice and her deputy director ben rhodes, brother of david rhodes cbs news president, appear to be two of the key figures behind the surveillance of donald trump s campaign. what was hillary s role in this massive scandal? why is the media not questioning her? does anyone really believe she had nothing to do with this? meanwhile, not surprisingly at cbs news you can find the latest headline:the cbs news headline is followed up by two paragraphs citing the washington post (one of the news publications who sat on the susan rice spying story). the story is clearly a distraction from the real news, which is that susan rice and the cbs news president s bother were behind the surveillance of trump s campaign. apparently, cbs news thinks that an alleged secret meeting between a donor of president trump and a russian close to putin with an agenda that remains unclear is somehow supposed to be relevant or important to the american people in the midst of a spying case that makes president nixon look like an amateur:washington the united arab emirates arranged a secret meeting in january between an american businessman supporting then president-elect trump and a russian close to president vladimir putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between moscow and the incoming president, the washington post reports.citing u.s., european and arab officials, the post said the uae agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with iran, including in syria, a trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to moscow on u.s. sanctions. the full agenda remains unclear, the newspaper said.daily caller former president barack obama s national security adviser susan rice ordered u.s. spy agencies to produce detailed spreadsheets of legal phone calls involving donald trump and his aides when he was running for president, according to former u.s. attorney joseph digenova. what was produced by the intelligence community at the request of ms. rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals, digenova told the daily caller news foundation investigative group monday. the overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with, digenova said. in short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls. also on monday, fox news and bloomberg news, citing multiple sources reported that rice had requested the intelligence information that was produced in a highly organized operation. fox said the unmasked names of trump aides were given to officials at the national security council (nsc), the department of defense, james clapper, president obama s director of national intelligence, and john brennan, obama s cia director.joining rice in the alleged white house operations was her deputy ben rhodes, according to fox.critics of the atmosphere prevailing throughout the obama administration s last year in office point to former obama deputy defense secretary evelyn farkas who admitted in a march 2 television interview on msnbc that she was urging my former colleagues, to get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before president obama leaves the administration. farkas sought to walk back her comments in the weeks following: i didn t give anybody anything except advice. col. (ret.) james waurishuk, an nsc veteran and former deputy director for intelligence at the u.s. central command, told thedcnf that many hands had to be involved throughout the obama administration to launch such a political spying program. the lawyers and counsel at the nsa surely would be talking to the lawyers and members of counsel at cia, or at the national security council or at the director of national intelligence or at the fbi, he said. it s unbelievable of the level and degree of the administration to look for information on donald trump and his associates, his campaign team and his transition team. this is really, really serious stuff. michael doran, former nsc senior director, told thedcnf monday that somebody blew a hole in the wall between national security secrets and partisan politics. this was a stream of information that was supposed to be hermetically sealed from politics and the obama administration found a way to blow a hole in that wall. that s a felony, he told thedcnf. and you can get 10 years for that. it is a tremendous abuse of the system. we re not supposed to be monitoring american citizens. bigger than the crime, is the breach of public trust. we re looking at a potential constitutional crisis from the standpoint that we used an extremely strong capability that s supposed to be used to safeguard and protect the country, he said. and we used it for political purposes by a sitting president. that takes on a new precedent. for entire story: daily caller",1,23,0.0,0,0,0,0.030303030303030304,14.414782608695656,16.156521739130437,0.0,0.0

"painted as epipen villain, mylan’s chief says she’s no such thing - the new york times","america has a new pharmaceutical villain. her name is heather bresch. as the chief executive of mylan, the owner of the severe allergy treatment epipen, ms. bresch is at the center of the latest public outrage over high drug prices, excoriated for overseeing a fourfold price increase on epipen while taking a huge pay raise. from talk shows to twitter, her name is being mentioned alongside martin shkreli, the pharma bro who ignited anger last fall over raising the price of the drug daraprim, and j. michael pearson, the onetime mckinsey consultant who took over valeant pharmaceuticals international and sharply raised prices on lifesaving drugs. but mr. shkreli and mr. pearson were outliers trying to upend the industry. at one point, the pharmaceutical industry’s main lobbying group disavowed them. not so with ms. bresch. in many ways, she is an ultimate insider. her father is a united states senator. she runs one of the largest generic drug companies in the world. she also oversees the generic pharmaceutical association — the generic industry’s lobbying group. now the question is whether her different position will give her a different result. both mr. shkreli and mr. pearson were forced out of their companies. already, ms. bresch, 47, has moved more quickly than they did to quell public furor over prices. on thursday, she announced that the company was increasing financial assistance to patients to reduce their costs. but the company did not say it would lower the list price — which has risen to about $600 for a pack of two epipens, from about $100 when mylan acquired the product in 2007. in an interview, ms. bresch said the price increases on epipen weren’t even in the “same hemisphere” as what mr. shkreli did when he raised the price of daraprim by 50 times overnight. over the years, her brash leadership style has bruised egos but also, some say, improved access to drugs and raised quality standards. her company, mylan, also has a reputation for tactics that have angered competitors and investors alike. “i think we mean what we say: you can do good and do well, and i think we strike that balance around the globe,” ms. bresch said. still, she was unapologetic that mylan’s actions were driven by profit. “i am running a business. i am a business. i am not hiding from that. ” how the company, and ms. bresch, strikes that balance seems to be quickly changing. generic drug companies once dealt almost exclusively in making cheap copies of pills and railed passionately against the anticompetitive tactics of competitors. now, through a series of acquisitions and mergers, the handful of large generic companies that are left are increasingly investing in expensive drugs, and in doing so, are embracing many of the tactics they once scorned. “it’s like talking out of both sides of your mouth,” said dinesh thakur, an advocate for generic drug quality. “to me, i think, it’s opportunistic. ” in the interview, ms. bresch said the company’s latest actions would do the most to help patients where it mattered, by reducing their costs. and she said that the $600 list price was necessary for the company to recoup its investment in the epipen, which includes raising awareness for severe allergic reaction and making improvements to the way the product works. but she also sought to shift blame away from mylan, saying that patients are feeling the pain in part because insurers have increased the amount that customers must pay in recent years. “what else do you shop for that when you walk up to the counter, you have no idea what it’s going to cost you?” she said. “tell me where that happens anywhere else in the system. it’s unconscionable. ” to some, the company’s response seemed to ring hollow. “it’s a real challenge to understand how a management team sits around a board table and makes a decision to raise the price of a lifesaving medication over and over and over, and when the p. r. storm hits, decides to blame someone else for that price increase,” said david maris, an analyst for wells fargo. he had warned investors in june that mylan’s price increases on epipen and other drugs could soon draw unwanted media scrutiny. the company is not a stranger to controversy. robert j. coury, mylan’s chairman who served as chief executive until 2011, came under scrutiny in 2012 for using the company’s corporate jet to travel to his son’s music concerts. and last year, the wall street journal reported that one of the board members had undisclosed ties to the land where the company built its new pittsburgh offices. ms. bresch has also weathered her share of controversy, like when it was discovered that west virginia university awarded her a business degree 10 years after she had attended the school, even though she had completed only about half of the coursework. a report by the university later concluded that officials wrongly awarded her the degree because she was the daughter of the joe manchin, now a democratic senator representing west virginia. mr. manchin and ms. bresch have said they did nothing wrong. the company also angered shareholders when it switched its headquarters to the netherlands, and then used a provision in dutch law to block a takeover by the pharmaceutical giant teva, which many investors had favored. the move to the netherlands in 2014, called an inversion, also reduced the company’s tax rate. mylan is one of a string of pharmaceutical companies that have done inversions in recent years, prompting outcry in washington and calls to limit the practice. ms. bresch’s rising salary has also fueled anger over the epipen price increase. since 2007, when epipen was acquired and she was the company’s chief operating officer, she earned about $2. 5 million in total compensation. in 2015, her compensation was nearly $19 million. mylan’s board has said in company filings that it believes her pay is justified because she has contributed significantly to the company’s growth in recent years. ms. bresch, who has worked at mylan for 25 years, said her west virginia upbringing had informed her approach to serving as chief executive. “there is a work ethic and grit about that that allows me to help make a difference,” she said. some of the chafing at her style, she said, is because people are resistant to change. her top accomplishments, she said, include getting a federal law passed that required more inspections of overseas drug manufacturers, and improving access to aids drugs for patients overseas. “to make change happen, to make a difference, mediocrity doesn’t get you there,” she said. even as they have ruffled feathers within the industry, ms. bresch and mylan have earned measured praise from consumer advocates, who said she wielded her influence in ways that helped consumers. james love, director of the consumers group knowledge ecology international, said ms. bresch opened doors at the office of the united states trade representative when his group and others were working to change provisions in the proposed partnership that they said would have limited access to drugs by people overseas. mylan, as a seller of generic drugs, shared their interest, he said. “they came in with some very talented people in the negotiations, and they knew what was going on politically,” mr. love said. still, he said, he opposes their position on the epipen and said his group was composing a letter of complaint to the federal trade commission. “i’m appalled at the price increase,” he said. “i don’t want to sugarcoat that. ”",0,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.05263157894736842,4.420000000000002,6.0,0.0,0.0
kentucky lawmaker a 'probable suicide' amid sexual misconduct accusations,"(reuters) - kentucky state representative dan johnson, who was facing sexual assault accusations, died in a probable suicide on wednesday, bullitt county coroner dave billings said. johnson, 57, also the leader of the louisville-area heart of fire church, held a news conference on tuesday at which he denied accusations contained in a report by the kentucky center for investigative reporting. the report, published earlier in the week, included accusations from a woman that johnson molested her in 2013 when she was a teenager. johnson, whose press conference was widely reported by local media, also defied calls by some legislators to step down. on wednesday evening, johnson was found dead in a probable suicide from a single gunshot wound near louisville, the coroner said, adding that an autopsy would be performed on thursday. billings said law enforcement officials had been searching for johnson after someone read a post on his facebook page, became concerned and contacted police. the post has since been taken down, but the courier-journal reported that it appeared to be a farewell and read in part, “the accusations from npr are false, god and only god knows the truth. nothing is the way they make it out to be.” the death comes amid a national reckoning over sexual harassment and abuse that has included allegations of misconduct in a number of state legislatures, including in kentucky. kentucky republican jeff hoover recently resigned his post as speaker of the kentucky house of representatives under a cloud of sexual harassment allegations. “saddened to hear of tonight’s death of ky representative dan johnson,” kentucky republican gov. matt bevin wrote on twitter. “my heart breaks for his family tonight...these are heavy days in frankfort and in america...may god indeed shed his grace on us all...we sure need it.” michael skoler, president of louisville public media, which operates the investigative reporting center, said in a statement on social media that the organization reached out to johnson numerous times during its seven-month investigation but that he declined to discuss the group’s findings. johnson was elected in 2016 despite becoming known for a 2016 facebook post comparing president barack obama and michelle obama to monkeys, wdrb-tv has reported.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,20.697777777777777,34.71111111111111,0.0,0.0

"responding to criticism, trump calls on justice ginsburg to resign","washington (reuters) - u.s. republican presidential contender donald trump called on wednesday for the resignation of supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg, describing her as mentally unfit after she lambasted him in a series of media interviews. “justice ginsburg of the u.s. supreme court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me,” trump said in a twitter post. “her mind is shot - resign!” the new york billionaire chided ginsburg, 83, for criticizing him this week and expressing concern for the country’s future if he is elected in november. trump said it was inappropriate for supreme court justices to weigh in on political campaigns. he told the new york times on tuesday that he thought it was a disgrace to the court and that ginsburg should apologize to her colleagues on the bench. trump was not alone in the rebuke. in an editorial on wednesday, the new york times urged ginsburg to uphold the court’s tradition of silence in political campaigns. “justice ruth bader ginsburg needs to drop the political punditry and the name-calling,” the editorial said. the times said there was no legal requirement that supreme court justices keep silent on political campaigns, but it expressed concern that ginsburg would jeopardize her own commitment to impartiality. ginsburg was not immediately available for comment on trump’s remarks and the editorial. in a cnn interview posted on tuesday, ginsburg called trump “a faker.” “he has no consistency about him,” she said. “he says whatever comes into his head at the moment. he really has an ego. “how has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? the press seems to be very gentle with him on that.” earlier, ginsburg joked about moving to new zealand if trump wins the white house. “i can’t imagine what this place would be - i can’t imagine what the country would be — with donald trump as our president,” she said in a new york times interview published on sunday. trump adviser sam clovis told cnn on wednesday that ginsburg’s comments were out of character for supreme court justices but should not have been surprising. “she has always been a firebrand,” he said.

sentenced to death: a look at dylann roof’s rampage and its aftermath - the new york times,"update: a federal jury has unanimously sentenced dylann s. roof to die. the white supremacist showed no remorse for killing nine members of a black church in south carolina. read more » • mr. roof, a white supremacist with no known ties to any organized group, was convicted of the assault on dec. 15 by the same federal jury. • mr. roof’s guilt was never in question in the trial, and the jury deliberated for about three hours before assessing the death penalty. • judge richard m. gergel has scheduled a formal sentencing hearing for wednesday at 9:30 a. m. “we want to express our sympathy to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by dylann roof’s actions. today’s sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. we are sorry that, despite our best efforts, the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy. ” “we are dylann roof’s family. we will always love dylann. we will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people. we wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes, and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt. we continue to pray for the emanuel a. m. e. families and the charleston community. ” “no verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at mother emanuel. and no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to roof’s callous hand. but we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of charleston — and the people of our nation — with a measure of closure. ” on the evening of wednesday, june 17, 2015, mr. roof, a white man, walked into the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston, s. c. and asked for the pastor, the rev. clementa c. pinckney. mr. roof was directed to a bible study session, where he sat down next to the pastor, and for nearly an hour, listened and took part in the discussion. mr. roof then pulled out a . glock semiautomatic pistol, loaded with bullets, and according to witnesses, told the minister and parishioners, “you are raping our women and taking over our country. ” he shot and killed nine people, including mr. pinckney, before fleeing the church. he shot each victim multiple times, reloading his gun several times. mr. roof told investigators and friends that he had hoped to start a race war. he complained of what he saw as black corruption and takeover of the united states and what he said was an epidemic of crime. he owned a website that included an essay on his belief in the danger and inferiority of blacks and the value of segregation. in the essay, mr. roof, a dropout with few friends and no steady work, also gave his reasons for the attack: “we have no skinheads, no real kkk, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and i guess that has to be me. ” the gunman could not have chosen a target more laden with symbolism about the nation’s tortured racial history, and he apparently knew it, singling out the church for that reason. emanuel a. m. e. lies in the historic heart of charleston, the capital of the slave trade in the united states, the cradle of the confederacy and the place where the first shots of the civil war were fired. the church, known as mother emanuel, occupies a place of pride in southern black history it is one of the oldest black congregations in the south, dating back two centuries. many people were shaken because the shooting happened in a place of sanctuary and because of who the victims were: nine people who were described as gentle and deeply religious. three of them were over age 70, and four were pastors. at mr. roof’s first court appearance a few days later, victims’ family members stunned and moved millions of americans by speaking of forgiveness and redemption, rather than anger and vengeance. black churches have been frequent targets of racist attacks for generations, and for people old enough to remember, the shooting carried reminders of the 1963 church bombing in birmingham, ala. that killed four black girls. one of the charleston dead, mr. pinckney, 41, was also a democratic state senator and a leader of south carolina’s black community whose warmth won him friends even among political adversaries. at his funeral, president obama gave the eulogy, an impassioned plea to recognize and oppose prejudice, saying, “for too long, we’ve been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. ” after decades of debate, a confederate battle flag was removed from the grounds of south carolina’s state capitol with remarkable swiftness, lowered for good less than a month after the shooting, following an emotional debate in the legislature. in previous fights over the flag, white conservatives defended it staunchly, but this time, conservative republicans like gov. nikki haley, senator lindsey graham and state senator paul thurmond — son of the united states senator and onetime segregationist champion strom thurmond — publicly opposed the flag, sealing its fate. but calls for stricter gun controls, including tighter background checks for buying weapons, fell flat. under federal law, mr. roof’s record of drug abuse might have barred him from buying the gun he used, but the balky background check system failed to produce the needed information within three days, so he was able to go ahead with the purchase. mr. roof confessed to investigators soon after he was arrested, and more recently, he offered to plead guilty in return for a sentence of life in prison. but federal prosecutors decided to go to trial and seek the death penalty. at his trial last month, his lawyers conceded that he had committed the attack. a jury found him guilty of all 33 counts against him, including hate crimes resulting in death. the case then moved to the penalty phase, to determine whether mr. roof should be executed. (if he had not been sentenced to die, he could have still faced capital punishment in state court.) acting as his own lawyer in the penalty phase, mr. roof declined to present any defense, and he refused any argument or evidence suggesting mental illness. in a journal he kept before the shooting, he had written: “i am morally opposed to psychology. it is a jewish invention. ” the vast majority of capital sentences and executions stem from state courts, not federal. of about 2, 900 people on death rows in the united states, just 68 face sentences meted out by federal courts, including six by military courts. the federal inmates under death sentences include dzhokhar tsarnaev, one of the brothers who carried out the boston marathon bombing in 2013 and nidal hasan, who committed the fort hood shooting in 2009. when timothy mcveigh, the oklahoma city bomber, was executed in 2001, he was the first federal inmate put to death in 38 years. there have been just two federal executions since then — in 2001 and 2003. it would be hard to find another crime where the toll was as high, the victims were as sympathetic, the premeditation was as evident and the defendant’s guilt was as . but mr. roof’s case has prompted a debate over whether he should be put to death. some commentators and editorial boards have argued that a crime of this magnitude cries out for execution. even some with doubts about how the death penalty is used say that if capital punishment is to continue, mr. roof warrants it. death penalty opponents agree that if any defendant deserves the ultimate punishment, it is mr. roof, but they insist that the case against capital punishment should still outweigh the anger and revulsion over any particular case. they argue that its use has been wildly inconsistent and even arbitrary, and exonerations of convicted inmates show that the risk of putting an innocent person to death is high. a twist in this case is that a common argument against the death penalty is that it is more likely to be used when the victims are white and the accused are black — the reverse of the circumstances in the charleston shooting. another is that even some family members of those who were murdered have spoken out against executing mr. roof. much less common than it used to be. states carried out 20 executions last year, the lowest figure in 25 years. courts handed down just 30 new death sentences, down from more than 300 in 1996, the lowest figure since the early 1970s.",0,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.05263157894736842,6.137499999999999,8.9,0.0,0.0
"raising money for clinton, cher sounds off (and not just about trump) - the new york times","she compared him to hitler, likened his campaign to a “racist” version of “fun with dick and jane” and even said he evoked the murderous child star in “the bad seed. ” “i just think he’s” an idiot, cher said of donald j. trump, adding a decidedly unprintable modifier. the crowd on sunday in provincetown, mass. one of the country’s gay capitals, roared its approval at cher’s succinct and salty assessment. but the famed singer and actress was not just riffing between songs at a concert: she was introducing hillary clinton at a for her presidential campaign. cher did more than just blister mr. trump. she also offered a blunt appraisal of mrs. clinton’s strengths and weaknesses. “this chick is just tougher than chinese algebra,” cher said of the democratic nominee. prompting a mix of nervous laughter and applause, she added, “she is shy, and she’s not the greatest speaker in the world. ” cher said mrs. clinton had told her of being deeply affected by her failed effort to spearhead an overhaul of the nation’s health care system in 1993. “she got so crushed by the g. o. p. just for trying to set up health care, and she never thought it would be so personal, and she said it made her kind of pull in. ” “i hope she doesn’t mind my telling this story,” cher said, adding: “too late now!” her remarks, recorded by an attendee and posted on facebook, offered a colorful glimpse at a part of the presidential campaign that has been mainly to the general public and journalists this election cycle. both mrs. clinton and mr. trump have generally barred reporters from attending their . as cher demonstrated, the language used in private settings like the event on cape cod — which brought in more than $1 million for mrs. clinton’s campaign — can be more inflammatory and raw than what is said with a bank of television cameras present. and it was not just the entertainer, whose twitter posts often employ a toilet emoji instead of mr. trump’s name, who spoke bluntly. mrs. clinton, who often discusses how well she was able to work with republicans during her tenure in the senate, took the stage and acknowledged former representative barney frank, democrat of massachusetts, noting that he has been promoting a new bumper sticker. “i think it is something like, ‘democrats aren’t perfect — but they’re nuts! ’” said mrs. clinton. “you understand that. ” but mrs. clinton, a portion of whose remarks was also posted online, was not onstage when cher, 70, arrived to loud applause, a few lines of her song “woman’s world. ” cher warned that mr. trump’s slogan, “make america great again,” was only a guise for a more divisive message. “he means, ‘we want to make america straight and white,’” she said. and she belittled mr. trump for his stumbling reference at the republican convention to the “l. g. b. t. q. ” community. “it’s like he just learned it, you know?” she said to laughter. speaking without notes, cher’s performance was more of an routine than a traditional political speech. “do you remember ‘fun with dick and jane? ’” she asked, referring to the 1970s comedy. “it’s like ‘racist fun with dick and jane.’ we’re going to build walls!” mr. trump, she added, reminded her of the pigtailed blond actress patty mccormack from “the bad seed. ” “consummate liar, doesn’t care who she hurts, insane and, you know, sociopathic narcissist,” she said. “i just wish he’d fall off the face of the earth. ” veering into more incendiary territory, cher invoked “old despots” and received a subdued response when she mentioned hitler and stalin. “we’re going to make germany great again,” she said, before digressing to a bit on britain’s vote to leave the european union. even as she sought to use her closing comments to praise mrs. clinton — “i believe in her so much,” she said — cher could not help but return to the object of her ire, mr. trump. “i know that if he got into office, our world would be the worst place,” cher said. “i don’t think we could imagine how bad it could get. ” she added that, “if breaking news ever happened and he had to go to the podium, we would just all go . .. ” she finished her thought with a expression of disgust. then she walked off to a roar of applause.",0,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.400000000000002,6.4,0.0,0.0

equatorial guinea leader's son found guilty of embezzlement by french court,"paris (reuters) - millions of euros of assets belonging to the son of equatorial guinea s president were ordered to be seized by a french court that found him guilty in absentia on friday of using money plundered from his country to buy property and luxury cars. the paris court found teodorin obiang, 48, guilty of embezzlement, and ordered the confiscation of more than 100 million euros worth of his french assets. obiang denied the charges. obiang, eldest son of president teodoro obiang and a vice president himself, was also handed a three-year suspended prison sentence and a suspended 30 million euros ($34.78 million) fine. the court president cited the slow response from parts of the french banking system in contributing to those penalties being suspended and hence more lenient. the case is the first of several to reach court in a broader judicial investigation into allegations of illicit acquisitions in france by long-time leaders and family relatives in several african countries including gabon and congo republic. obiang s luxury residence on paris avenue foch - a grand, sweeping road near the arc de triomphe often favoured by wealthy african expatriates and politicians - was among the assets scrutinised during the trial. the property, bought for 25 million euros in 2005, had 101 rooms, a gym, hair-dressing studio and disco with cinema screen. paris prosecutor jean-yves lourgouilloux said obiang s fraudulent spending amounted to more than 150 million euros. the court was critical of societe generale, france s second biggest bank, and the bank of france, deeming them complacent towards obiang s finances and too slow to react. the role of the two banks was taken into account to justify the suspended sentences for obiang, the court said. the attitude of societe generale, similar to that of the bank of france, may have led (obiang) to think for a long period of time that there was, in france, some kind of tolerance for these practices, benedicte de perthuis, the most senior judge sitting in the case, told the court. societe generale said it had not been a party in the trial and therefore we don t have any particular comment to make . officials at the bank of france did not immediately respond to a request for comment. obiang was first put on trial in january but the case, 10 years in the works, was postponed after his lawyers argued they had not had enough time to prepare his defence. his father, president teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo, has ruled equatorial guinea - a former spanish colony - for more than three decades, making him one of africa s longest-serving leaders, and rights groups have labelled his administration as one of the world s most corrupt.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.22727272727273,11.672727272727274,0.09090909090909091,0.0
china's xi lays out vision for 'new era' led by 'still stronger' communist party,"beijing (reuters) - chinese president xi jinping on wednesday laid out a confident vision for a more prosperous nation and its role in the world, stressing the importance of wiping out corruption and curbing industrial overcapacity, income inequality and pollution. opening a critical communist party congress, xi pledged to build a modern socialist country for a new era that will be proudly chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world. although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, xi said china s development had entered a new era , using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours. with decades of hard work, socialism with chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era, xi said. the twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new politburo standing committee to rule china s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place. the 64-year-old xi, widely regarded as the most powerful chinese leader since mao zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted great hall of the people, including 91-year-old former president jiang zemin. security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital. as expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans. on the economy, xi said china would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms. during xi s first term, china disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector. if xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done, damien ma, fellow and associate director at u.s. thinktank the paulson institute, told the reuters global markets forum. if not, then i would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in china. there have been talks in beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see. the european union chamber of commerce in china said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said european companies operating in china continued to suffer from promise fatigue . the only cure for this is promise implementation, it said in a statement. in what was probably an indirect reference to u.s. president donald trump s america first policy, xi promised that china would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. trump this year opted to withdraw the united states from the paris climate pact. no country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation, xi told the delegates, among them buddhist monks, olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut. xi set bold long-term goals for china s development, envisioning it as a basically modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist strong power with leading influence on the world stage by 2050. but he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling china s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people. xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the communist party and its place in contemporary china. we should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries, he said. we must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger. xi praised the party s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the gravest threat the party faces. on self-ruled taiwan, claimed by beijing as its own, xi said china would never allow the island to separate from china, adding that china would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century. he made no mention of neighbouring north korea, which has angered beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of u.n. sanctions. pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting. xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting china s rising might on the world stage. focus at the congress will be on how xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022. that could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with mao, the founding father of modern china. in all aspects he is on the right track to be our next chairman mao, su shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of qinghai, told reuters. he will lead the party and central committee to continue its way to success. as with other major set-piece events in the capital, beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down. large red banners plastered around beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet. tencent holdings ltd s wechat, china s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on tuesday that system maintenance would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end. the disabled features are sporadically used to show solidarity for popular social and political causes.",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.570000000000004,8.457142857142857,0.0,0.0

"trump just bailed on his own pittsburgh not paris rally, the reason why is infuriating","this week, donald trump disappointed the entire world by pulling out of the paris climate deal. it was a decision that was condemned by several world leaders, and marked yet another way that trump had ruined america s standing as a global leader. to celebrate his horrible decision, trump organized a pittsburgh not paris rally to celebrate america s exit from the deal. there was just one major problem trump blew it off.the trump campaign had hyped up this event so much, and even organized it to be located right across the street from the white house put donnie wasn t there. he bailed, and decided to play golf instead. so much for being a dedicated potus and showing his dwindling number of supporters that he appreciates them, as his approval ratings continue to plummet to historic lows.the white house press pool told politicususa: after an uneventful ride along highways and byways toward sterling, virginia, motorcade pulled up to the trump national golf club at 10:42 a.m.motorcade split off and pool is now holding in a spectacular clubhouse overlooking indoor tennis courts. if any of trump s supporters still think trump cared about and appreciated them, this is a pretty rude awakening. when trump s campaign announced the rally, it certainly sounded like trump would actually be present. however, the event invitation was a little more cryptic. it said: as you know, the president has been under siege from the mainstream media and the democrats, especially now that he put american jobs first by withdrawing from the paris accord. therefore, we are organizing a group to demonstrate our support for president trump and his fearless leadership. either way, these trump supporters expected trump to be there, and he wasn t because he was playing golf his main hobby when he wants to avoid doing his job. trump must know that his presidency is doomed, because blowing off a rally full of supporters when his popularity is suffering is a bold move. to make matters worse, this rally couldn t have been more convenient it was just across the street! and yet, trump couldn t be bothered.featured image via chip somodevilla / getty images",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0625,8.353333333333339,8.666666666666668,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667
more than half of britons now want to stay in eu - poll,"edinburgh (reuters) - a poll has found that 51 percent of britons would now keep european union membership while 41 percent want to leave the bloc, a near reversal of last year s referendum result. the bmg poll of 1,400 people for the independent published on the newspaper s website on saturday came as britain moves into a second phase of negotiations on exiting the eu, which will focus on trade. the independent said the lead for remain over leave was the biggest in any poll so far since the vote in june 2016. but the head of polling at bmg, quoted in the independent, said that the reason for the change was a shift in opinion among those who did not vote in last year s referendum, while around nine in 10 leave and remain voters were unchanged in their views. the survey was carried out from december 5 to 8. in the referendum last year, 52 percent of britons voted to leave the eu and 48 percent voted to remain. mike smithson, an election analyst who runs the www.politicalbetting.com website who is also a former liberal democrat politician, said on twitter it was the biggest lead for remain since (the eu referendum). prime minister theresa may this week secured an agreement with the eu to move brexit talks on to trade and a transition pact, but some european leaders warned that negotiations, which have been arduous so far, could now become tougher.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,2.8566666666666656,4.800000000000001,0.0,0.0
boehner vows fight to scuttle iran nuclear deal,"house speaker john boehner vowed wednesday to do ""everything possible"" to stop the newly struck iran nuclear deal, as congress formally begins consideration of the hard-fought pact. ""while the president's iran deal may have been applauded at the united nations, i think he faces serious skepticism here at home,"" boehner told reporters at a briefing. ""let me just assure you that members of congress will ask much tougher questions this afternoon when we meet with the president's team, because a bad deal threatens the security of the american people."" the warning comes just days after the u.n. security council endorsed the deal, over the objections of many in congress. republicans, and some democrats, had wanted the administration to wait until congress reviews it before seeking approval from the united nations. congress nevertheless will have its say. fox news has learned the administration formally sent the deal to capitol hill on sunday -- this starts a 60-day clock for lawmakers to consider it, and then vote to approve or disapprove it or take no action. the white house has launched an aggressive campaign in recent days, trying to sway wavering democrats while publicly ripping republicans for opposing the deal. in an appearance on ""the daily show"" tuesday, obama portrayed the controversial deal as the best compromise the government could achieve. in a jab at the george w. bush administration, he joked that his critics think if only former vice president dick cheney had been on the u.s. negotiating team, ""then everything would be fine."" but congress is facing pressure from both sides of the issue. while the white house lobbies for approval, israeli ambassador ron dermer, a foe of the iran nuclear, is telling republicans that congress must stop the pact. dermer met wednesday morning with some 30 to 40 republicans -- part of the conservative opportunity society -- at the invitation of rep. steve king of iowa, the group's chairman. dermer told the group that congress is the last backstop and no deal is better than a bad deal. the u.n. action would not take effect for 90 days. congress technically has limited leverage over the international aspects of the agreement. still, obama does not want congress to kill any part of the deal, and has vowed to veto any such effort. the agreement itself would roll back sanctions in exchange for limits on iran's nuclear program, with the ultimate goal of blocking tehran's pathway to a nuclear weapon for as long as the deal's in place. critics argue that iran could still be well-positioned to pursue a nuclear weapon after a decade, all the while reaping billions in economic benefits. further, they're concerned the deal gives iran too much leeway to stall when international inspectors want to visit suspected nuclear sites. sen. tom cotton, r-ark., and rep. mike pompeo, r-kan., said in a statement tuesday that they learned from the international atomic energy agency (iaea) that two ""side deals"" between iran and the iaea will remain secret from congress and the public. according to the lawmakers, one agreement covers inspection of the parchin military complex, and the other concerns potential military aspects of iran's nuclear program. on the former, they said, iran would be able to strike a separate arrangement with the iaea concerning inspections at parchin. ""in failing to secure the disclosure of these secret side deals, the obama administration is asking congress and the american people to trust, but not verify,"" cotton said in a statement. ""what we cannot do is trust the terror-sponsoring, anti-american, outlaw regime that governs iran and that has been deceiving the world on its nuclear weapons work for years."" fox news' chad pergram and lucas tomlinson and the associated press contributed to this report.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.705000000000002,8.200000000000001,0.125,0.0
"fatah, hamas to discuss security in gaza under unity deal","gaza/ramallah (reuters) - negotiators from rival palestinian factions fatah and islamist group hamas will discuss security in the gaza strip at unity talks in cairo on tuesday, including a proposal that would see fatah security personnel deployed to hamas-dominated territory. the plan for 3,000 fatah security officers to join a gaza police force over the course of a year, part of a unity deal mediated by egypt in 2011, would restore much of the influence of fatah leader president mahmoud abbas in gaza and further loosen hamas grip. the deal was never implemented. the western-backed mainstream fatah party lost control of the enclave to hamas, considered a terrorist group by the west and israel, in fighting in 2007. the loss damaged abbas credibility in the eyes of the west and israel, after years of being their main palestinian diplomatic counterpart. but under egypt s mediation, major steps have been made toward narrowing rifts since hamas handed administrative powers in gaza to a fatah-backed government last month. the move was a major reversal for hamas and was partially prompted by the group s fears of potential financial and political isolation after its main donor qatar suffered a major diplomatic crisis with key allies. the sides will discuss the security issue, especially in gaza, in the way that serves the home front, enforces the rule of law in a professional and national way and is not factional, said hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum. under the deal, hamas would still have the most powerful armed palestinian faction, whose estimated 25,000 well-equipped fighters have fought three wars with israel since 2008. the issue of arms of resistance is not up for discussion, hamas official sami abu zuhri told reuters. israel s enmity with hamas means greater unity with fatah is unlikely to help any future efforts for a peace deal with israel. but both sides hope that the deal s proposed deployment of security personnel from the fatah-led palestinian authority to gaza s borders will encourage egypt and israel to ease their tight restrictions at border crossings, a badly needed step to help gaza revive its economy and improve the living standards of its two million residents. officials said that apart from the implementation of the 2011 agreement and security, the cairo talks would also cover issues such as setting a date for presidential and legislative elections and reforming the palestine liberation organization, which is in charge of long-stalled peace efforts with israel. what happened in the past days is something like a declaration of principles while the two sides have postponed final status issues to the talks in cairo, said gaza political analyst akram attallah. abbas has pledged there would be one authority, one law, one administration, one weapon in the gaza strip, a statement seeming to challenge hamas continued security dominance. but tayseer nasrallah, a member of the fatah revolutionary council, told reuters: there are difficult challenges and it will take time to overcome them. outstanding issues include the fate of 40,000 to 50,000 employees hired by hamas over the past 10 years and its demand abbas lift economic sanctions he imposed in recent months to try to pressure the group to compromise.

u.s. house panel to begin hearings on tax reform next week,"washington (reuters) - the tax-writing committee of the u.s. house of representatives will begin holding hearings on a republican tax reform proposal next week, the panel’s chairman said on tuesday, even as the timeline for overhauling the tax code slips toward late 2017. house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady told fox news he would soon announce a hearing schedule to examine his house tax reform blueprint with its proposal to tax imports, a plan that appears to have lost ground as the white house works to unveil its own approach. the investment consulting firm veda partners advised clients on tuesday to expect an april 27 hearing on the import tax proposal known as the border adjustment tax, or bat. brady’s committee could not confirm the date or topic, but he told fox news the committee “will soon be announcing congressional hearings on our blueprint starting next week.” he also acknowledged that the tax reform timeline could slip as house republicans try to reach agreement to repeal and replace the affordable care act, known as obamacare, following their failed attempt to pass healthcare legislation in march. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said this week that tax reform may not get done before an august deadline. “we probably ought not be focused on the month but the year that it happens, which is this year,” brady said. “if it moves a little past august and still lands in this year, it’s going to be an incredible achievement.” much of the debate has focused on the house republican bat proposal, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports, while exempting exports from taxation. the proposal is opposed by import-dependent industries and republicans who worry it could lead to higher consumer prices. tax experts say the proposal’s future depends on whether the white house backs it. president donald trump, who dislikes the term “border adjustment,” said on tuesday his tax reform plan would create “a level playing field” for u.s. industry - a phrase widely viewed as referring to some kind of border tax. brady identified the critical elements of legislation as significant rate reduction, full and immediate expensing for capital investments and a simplified tax code. he cautioned against straightforward rate reductions of the kind that some in congress have begun to consider. “a rate cut alone would have worked in the 1980s. it doesn’t in 2017 if we’re going to be competitive,” brady said.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.790909090909089,4.4,0.0,0.0

even trump voters think obama’s economy is doing great,"democrats and a lot of republicans are scratching our heads trying to figure out the appeal of the braggadocios billionaire. democrats say that the appeal is very basic; his message of nationalism, xenophobia, sexism and racism makes aging white people feel like they are losing all their power. trump voters say it s something different; they say it s the economy, unless it s their economy. while obama has apparently screwed up the economy, they think their local economies are doing just great.it s not terribly surprising. to hear trump speak, we are in some sort of post apocalyptic hellscape that only the orange one can take us out of. you know he s trying to justify the economy. it s the slowest recovery in our history, and it s not a recovery, he said.source: the hilltrump calls the economy a disaster. trump even repeats the bogus claim that the unemployment rate is over 40 percent. that would be apocalyptic.now, delegates are supposed to be (supposed to be) a cross section of the american people. if anything, they should be a little smarter than the average bear, at least the average republican bear, but even they seem to excel at compartmentalizing. they are individually very happy with the economy, but they also believe trump when the billionaire tells them they are suffering. actually, we re doing great, says donna gottschall, a human resources consultant in greenville, s.c. employment s up. housing s up. everything s green in greenville! oh, yeah, unemployment is way down, says al baldasaro, a state legislator and retired marine from londonderry, n.h. obviously, it s gotten better. things are wonderful in our town, says ranae lentz, a republican county chair from bellefontaine, ohio. we can t fill all the job openings. source: politicowhile it s unlikely that any trump supporter would credit obama with anything at all, some do credit bush.tina harris, a longtime realtor in palm harbor, florida, told me the housing market is booming. but she argued that this was a troubling data point, because buyers were liquidating their 401(k) accounts and taking money out of the real economy to purchase homes. have you checked your 401(k) lately? asked her friend nancy riley, another veteran realtor in the st. petersburg area. i said i hadn t, but i did know the stock market had just hit an all-time high, and i didn t see why jobs in construction and real estate like theirs shouldn t count as the real economy. i m not saying everything is horrible, harris said. but it was george w. bush who put in the policies that got the economy going. obama did nothing. strangely, even trump himself has accidentally given a thumbs up to obama s economy. in announcing his running mate, indiana s governor, mike pence, trump bragged that the unemployment rate has gone from 8.4 percent to 5 percent. well, under obama, the nation s unemployment rate has gone from 10 percent to under 5 percent.no one is claiming the economy is perfect. thanks in part to republican policies, like refusing to raise the minimum wage, wages have been stagnant, and also thanks to republican policies, the income gap has only grown. there s still a lot of work to be done, but trump s policies won t do it. in fact, the chief economist at moody s predicts that trump s protectionist platform will lose us 3.5 million jobs.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.89777777777778,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.1111111111111111

"in nairobi slum, rock-throwers, police keep voters at bay","nairobi (reuters) - it had all the trappings of a proper polling station - ballot-boxes, pots of indelible ink, registration lists and a dozen election officials dutifully seated behind school desks. the only things missing were the voters. in nairobi s kibera slum, a hot-bed of support for veteran opposition leader raila odinga, many young men failed to heed his call for a peaceful stay-away from thursday s election, a re-run of an august presidential vote annulled by the courts. after opening six hours late because of a lack of security, the polling station at kibera s olympic primary school came under attack from stone-throwing youths determined to ward off any voters. police at the gates responded with volleys of tear gas followed by live rounds, sending gangs of youths chanting slogans against president uhuru kenyatta scurrying for cover in the warren of streets and tin-shacks next to the school walls. riot officers then sealed off the area, making it impossible for even residents to get through, let alone would-be voters prepared to run the gauntlet of pro-odinga peer pressure. i don t want to vote. i just want to go to my home, said 24-year-old kevin ouma-sigiria, after being turned back by armed riot police blocking the rubble-strewn road 500 metres (1500 feet) from the school. as he spoke, another man tried to talk his way through the road-block, only to receive a prod in the chest from a wooden club, followed by a nonchalant whack around the ankles. there is a crisis up there, one of the riot officers, who idenitified himself only as kevin, said. if they come one-by-one, that s ok. but if they gather again, the crisis will get bigger. moments later, 35-year-old said mohammed scurried down the street in the opposite direction with his wife and three small children to pack them off to relatives living up-country. it s not good for their health, he said, clutching his children s hands as the pop of exloding tear-gas grenades echoed across the tin roof-tops. other opposition strongholds in western kenya saw similar unrest, causing the election commission to postpone voting there until the weekend - although there is little prospect of a 48-hour delay yielding a different outcome. in kibera, polling station staff should have slept overnight at the olympic school but were unable to do so because of fear of being attacked. as it was, they arrived under armed escort at 10am - four hours after voting was meant to start. the ballot boxes, also escorted by a heavily armed police contingent, arrived an hour after that - not that there was any chance of them being used. nobody is going to vote here today, said olympic deputy presiding officer jaqueline onuko, blithely tucking into a sandwich as rocks clanged against the metal roof of the classroom-cum-polling station. the first time around was very busy...they were here queueing at 3 in the morning. now nobody is going to come. they are scared of both the police and their neighbors.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.58666666666667,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.1111111111111111

pence voices u.s. concern to turkish prime minister about arrests,"washington (reuters) - u.s. vice president mike pence expressed “deep concern” to turkey’s prime minister on thursday about the arrests of american citizens and local staff of u.s. missions in turkey, the white house said. the matters raised by pence are some of the issues that have created tension between the two nato allies in recent months, along with a dispute over a turkish cleric living in the united states whom ankara accuses of orchestrating a failed military coup in turkey last year. in a white house meeting with prime minister binali yildirim, pence voiced “deep concern over the arrests of american citizens, mission turkey local staff, journalists, and members of civil society under the state of emergency and urged transparency and due process in the resolution of their cases,” the white house said in a statement. in may, a translator at the u.s. consulate in the province of adana in southern turkey was arrested. more recently, a u.s. drug enforcement administration worker was detained in istanbul. both are accused of links to last year’s coup attempt. the u.s. embassy has said the accusations are baseless. before leaving for the united states, yildirim had said turkey’s demand for the united states to hand over cleric fethullah gulen, who has lived in pennsylvania since 1999, would be discussed during his visit. u.s. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to order gulen’s extradition. another issue to be raised, yildirim had said, was the fate of some turkish citizens arrested in the united states - a reference to a wealthy gold trader who was arrested over iran sanctions evasion last year and an executive at a state-owned bank arrested this year. the white house statement made no mention of any discussions about either subject. it said the two officials “expressed hope that their meeting would help to usher in a new chapter in u.s.-turkey relations and agreed on the need for constructive dialogue, as friends and allies, on bilateral challenges.” pence reaffirmed the “enduring strategic partnership” between the two countries and stressed the u.s. commitment to stand with turkey against the militant kurdistan workers party (pkk) “and other terrorist threats.” the united states partially resumed issuing visas in turkey on monday after getting what it said were assurances about the safety of staff at its missions following a number of detentions. turkey said it would relax a visa ban of its own.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.420000000000002,6.0,0.0,0.1
"as turkey coup unfolded, ‘the whole night felt like doomsday’ - the new york times","istanbul — thousands of soldiers and officers purged from the military. a helicopter shot down over the capital. hundreds of people lying dead on city streets. as dawn broke saturday, the citizens of turkey emerged and after a night of violence that felt more like life in neighbors like syria or iraq. and trying to assert control was president recep tayyip erdogan, targeting plotters in the previous night’s coup and other perceived enemies of the state. the embattled president, after a confusing absence in the early hours of the coup, appeared to speak to the nation early saturday. he exhorted his followers with the facetime app from his cellphone, resorting to the kind of medium he has long sought to suppress. that stunning scene, televised nationwide, at first seemed an embarrassment for a leader who presents himself as and suggested his end. but it was actually the turning point, as mr. erdogan called on his followers to take to the streets and gather at the airport in istanbul, which the military had shut down, to resist the coup. by the afternoon, after a standoff in ankara, the capital, the government had wrested back an army headquarters building held by coup plotters. mr. erdogan, who had frequently talked of conspiracies afoot to undermine his power, was back in control, seemingly as powerful as ever, and perhaps even more paranoid. the attempted coup, as it unfolded, suggested an alarming unraveling for a country that is seen in the west as a crucial partner in the fight against terrorism and an anchor of stability in a region full of trouble. the united states has sought close cooperation with turkey in the fight against the islamic state, while europe has relied on turkey to help stem the flow of refugees from countries of the middle east to the continent. “the whole night felt like doomsday,” said sibel samli, an independent film producer in istanbul. “people flocked to the markets to get bread, eggs and water. people were going to cash machines to draw out cash. ” a steamy friday was just getting going when the first hint came that something was not right: the military sealed off two bridges across the bosporus. then, fighter jets and helicopters began flying low over istanbul and ankara, rattling residents enjoying a night on the town, and sporadic gunshots rang out. suddenly, turks were transfixed by their cellphones, or the televisions in bars and restaurants, trying to figure out what was going on. no one seemed to know where the president was. as rumors swirled that the military was maneuvering to thwart a terror plot, or that a hijacked airliner was in the sky, many turks, given their nation’s history of military meddling in politics, began to wonder if a coup was afoot. soon enough, they had their answer: the prime minister, binali yildirm, spoke on television and said a renegade faction within the military was trying to mount a coup. and a military group, later calling itself the peace at home council — a reference to a mantra of turkey’s secular founder, mustafa kemal ataturk — issued a statement saying it had seized control of the country. and so began a surreal evening that stretched until daybreak, punctuated by violence that killed at least 265 people, most of them members of the security forces, as various factions fought each other for control of the country. the night seemed to encapsulate the many dramas and conflicts that have roiled turkey in recent years: street protests the bitter fight between mr. erdogan, an islamist, and a onetime ally, the muslim cleric fethullah gulen, whom the president late in the night blamed for the coup attempt and rising political violence and terrorism. ms. samli had been sitting with friends at a rooftop bar of a chic hotel on the european side of istanbul when a helicopter passed low over their heads. “we didn’t think anything of it at first because we knew the city was on high terror alerts following recent attacks,” she said. “then we started getting the calls and whatsapp notifications about the start of a military coup. people were calling one another telling them go home. ” the first signs that the coup might not succeed came as it become clear that the military failed to secure important government buildings, or to seize elected officials, normally the first actions of a putsch. later it was learned that the conspirators had sought out mr. erdogan at the seaside town of marmaris, where he was apparently vacationing, but were too late. and then mr. erdogan himself appeared, from an undisclosed location, and spoke to the nation on facetime. once again — as he did when he faced down a widespread street revolt in 2013 and to win elections, for himself as president and in parliament for his islamist justice and development party — mr. erdogan relied on his power base of turkey’s religious conservatives. mosque preachers joined mr. erdogan’s call to resist. “we will not let turkey fall!” men shouted in the conservative istanbul neighborhood of istinye on saturday morning, firing guns in to the air. “god is greatest!” the scariest hour was the one just before mr. erdogan’s jet landed in istanbul after 3 a. m. fighter jets flew low over istanbul, setting off sonic booms that felt like airstrikes. gunfire crackled throughout the city and in ankara, where soldiers seized civilian cars to use as barricades. several explosions were reported at parliament, and a helicopter used by the plotters was blown from the sky, officials said. a helicopter landed at the offices of cnn turk, and soldiers, apparently coup plotters, tried to seize the station during a live broadcast. “around 3 a. m. we heard loud fighter jets and explosions,” said ms. samli, the film producer in istanbul. “that’s when i felt scared. and this morning, everyone is in shock. everyone is trying to work out what happened. ” late in the night, as the sounds of war mixed with muezzins at mosques exhorting people to go into the streets and people chanting “allahu akbar,” or “god is greatest,” turkey’s cities felt like besieged cities in iraq or syria. when mr. erdogan landed in istanbul, chaos was still gripping istanbul and ankara, with more explosions and gunshots, but his very appearance seemed to signify that the conspiracy was reaching its end. in characteristic fashion, as he has when confronted with street protests and a corruption investigation, he vowed to root out the conspirators. “this attempt, this move, is a great favor from god to us,” he said. “why? because this move will allow us to clean up the armed forces, which needs to be completely clean. ” it was becoming clear, by the time mr. erdogan landed in istanbul, that those behind the coup did not have enough support within the military, even as the whole episode exposed deep divisions within the military that had not been so apparent. while the turkish military has a history of intervening in politics — it carried out three coups in the past five decades — mr. erdogan and his allies had systematically sought to the army through a series of sensational trials, and it was thought not able to mount a takeover of the government. officials said the main plotters were from the gendarmerie, a police force the air force and some elements of the land forces. several generals and colonels were arrested — none figures recognizable to the public — and thousands of officers and soldiers were rounded up saturday in a purge that is likely to go one for some time. “all of these guys will go to prison for life,” said ilnur cevik, an aide to mr. erdogan, in a telephone interview saturday afternoon. as the night wore on, some turks, underscoring the hold that conspiracy theories have on turkish society, believed the whole thing was a hoax or something staged by mr. erdogan so he could ride to the rescue. that would give himself a pretext to crack down even further on his perceived enemies and pursue more power by establishing an executive presidency. “we didn’t know if it was real or a hoax,” ms. samli said. “people around us were saying that it was a staged coup orchestrated by president erdogan to help him obtain more power over the country. ” younger turks panicked after seeing older turks, who have lived through coups and the street violence that has come with them, react with horror. “we had barely recovered from the istanbul airport terrorist attack and now everyone has started talking about a civil war,” said esra goksu, 32, an artist who lives in istanbul. “hundreds of people died for what? one man’s ego? it breaks my heart. i don’t recognize my country anymore. i want to leave. ” after daybreak on saturday, when it was apparent that the coup attempt had failed, central istanbul was eerily quiet. there was little sign of security forces, which are usually out in force at any sign of trouble, sealing streets and lining up at intersections while backed by armored vehicles. but there were signs of life, as workers hauled trash, shops and cafes began opening, and a group of religious men on mopeds motored down istiklal avenue, the city’s main pedestrian street, waving the turkish flag and chanting, “allahu akbar!” across the city, the police began rounding up suspected plotters, and soldiers who had taken control of the bosporus bridge the night before began surrendering, leaving equipment and clothing strewn about. “when i was waking up, i was thinking, ‘was this a nightmare, or did we really witness these things? ’” said sinan ulgen, a former turkish diplomat who is the chairman of the center for economics and foreign policy studies, a research organization in istanbul. mr. ulgen said of the intrigue friday night and saturday morning: “it was clearly a junta within the military that staged a botched coup attempt. ” but, he said, given that those arrested so far did not appear to be of the highest rank in the military, “it shows how little support the coup had within the top brass of the military. ” with turkish society so deeply polarized, with about half the country supporting mr. erdogan and the other half bitterly opposed, a refusal to return to the dark days of military coups seemed to be one thing that united them as the episode unfurled over night. while the military factions clearly did not have enough support within the military to finish the job, they also appeared to miscalculate how the plot would be received by those who have long wished to see the end of mr. erdogan and his government. the coup plotters, mr. ulgen said, appeared to “grossly misjudge the sentiments of the turkish people, which over time, despite turkey’s own democratic shortcomings, have turned very intervention. ” under mr. erdogan, turkey has cracked down severely on journalists, sending many to jail and charging others with insulting mr. erdogan, a crime in turkey. but ultimately, in many ways, it was modern media that helped mr. erdogan fend off the coup. as the coup unfolded, he was able to communicate with the country over facetime, and it was coverage of a number of turkish outlets that, analysts said, helped sway the tide of public opinion and allow government officials a platform to communicate with the public. among those outlets was cnn turk, which has faced the wrath of the government over coverage officials believe to be . the coup plotters seemed stuck in the 1970s, having seized, for a time, the state broadcaster trt, while other news channels continued coverage, opposing the coup. turks were able to communicate over social media, sometimes using a vpn when twitter or facebook seemed to be inaccessible. “it’s a total media story,” said asli aydintasbas, a turkish journalist and writer. “this was about not being able to control the message. ” ms. aydintasbas was attending a dinner party friday when guests were alerted to messages on twitter about the intrigue unfolding. someone joked that it might be a coup. “we all laughed, because it’s not an option in turkey these days,” she said. “the idea of a coup is so retro. ”",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.041428571428572,8.457142857142857,0.0,0.0
republican gov wrecked economy so bad he’s started censoring reports,"kansas is bleeding money and jobs and governor sam brownback doesn t want the people to know how devastating his economic policies have been.in 2011, the tea party governor was so confident that his economic policy of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced spending would turn kansas into an economic powerhouse that he created a special group charged with writing reports on the results.but brownback s experiment has failed so spectacularly that the state is billions of dollars in debt, education funding is suffering, and job growth is pathetic. so pathetic that kansas is losing more jobs than it has gained.in january, brownback couldn t handle a report put together by his group that admitted kansas sometimes was faring worse than it had before brownback became governor, so he made every effort to cover it up.in other words, he censored it because his group was supposed to report that the economy is soaring, not falling to the ground like a rock.kansas center for economic growth executive director heidi holliday blasted brownback for killing the report. he specifically asked the council to hold him accountable through rigorous performance metrics. five years later, the metrics clearly show his tax experiment has failed while business leaders and local chambers of commerce across the state openly ask him to change course. in fact, brownback is so desperate to keep the people of kansas from calling for tarring and feathering him in a public square that he is turning to the federal government. instead of writing their own independent reports, the group is now restricted to getting their information from the federal reserve, which conservatives often claim is responsible whenever economic issues occur.that particularly surprised kansas house minority leader tom burroughs, who was quick to point out the irony. the missed revenue marks, missed job reports, missed projections shed light on his failed policies. i kind of find it a little ironic they chose to go to a federal government report after they blamed president obama for our economic problems. governor brownback s economic experiment is a complete failure and a joke. kansas economy is now in shambles and republicans have no one to blame but themselves. they believed that by implementing an extreme conservative fiscal policy without interference from democrats that they would prove trickle-down economics as a total success. instead, it failed miserably and now they want to censor any results from being reported.by all rights, brownback should have ousted by voters in 2014. but now kansas is stuck with him and his failed policies for at least another two years. meanwhile, the wealthy are laughing all the way to the bank.featured image via liberalbias.com",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.09090909090909091,11.91,16.0,0.1,0.0

finnish president says joining nato would require referendum,"helsinki (reuters) - any move by finland to join nato would need public approval via a referendum, president sauli niinisto told a panel debate on monday ahead of elections in january. the nordic country is a member of the european union but has stayed outside the nato military alliance in line with its tradition of avoiding confrontation with russia, with which it shares an 833 mile (1,340 km) border and a difficult history. it has forged closer ties with nato in recent years, however, sharing information and taking part in military exercises, reflecting concerns in finland about the ukraine crisis and increased east-west tensions in the baltic sea. niinisto, who is expected to easily win a second six-year term in the jan. 28 election, did not indicate whether he favoured joining nato but said a decision to apply for full membership would require a referendum. i am convinced that (membership) decision would require legitimacy, a wide acceptability... i would warn against making decisions where a significant part of citizens would get deep wounds, niinisto said in a panel discussion in helsinki. only 21 percent of finns support joining nato, while 51 percent are opposed, a poll by yle showed in february. niinisto, 69, who will stand as an independent candidate after previously representing the conservative national coalition party, is known for cultivating good relations with russian counterpart vladimir putin. finland s president is in charge of foreign and defence policy together with the government. nils torvalds, the only one of seven presidential candidates who advocates joining nato, said politicians needed to show leadership on the issue. the thesis of a referendum blocks the discussion on membership. everybody s waiting for a referendum and are not taking a stance on the real question ... we do have a parliament to decide on issues. to apply for a membership when a crisis is knocking on the door, forget that. the membership must be applied for when the weather is still rather beautiful. torvalds, a politician for swedish people s party of finland, had 1 percent support in a recent opinion poll while niinisto had 76 percent. finland s centre-right government has said it will monitor the security situation in the region and retain the option of joining nato. russia, which has opposed nato s eastward expansion has said any move by helsinki to join would be of special concern .",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.080000000000002,18.2,0.0,0.0

obama to visit mosque where radical imam condones suicide bombings…even more unbelievable is list of muslims who committed horrific acts of terror against americans who prayed there,"our imam in chief told america he was a christian when he wanted us to elect him in 2007. his black liberation theology pastor of hate later revealed that barack only used the church as a way to boost his status as a community organizer. he s been openly mocking christianity for years now and now, of all the mosques in america he feels compelled to visit, it just happens to be one with a radical imam and ties to several terrorists who have committed atrocities against americans.all is forgiven with ignorant liberals who believe terror organization cair, when they say obama just wants to send a message of inclusion and mutual respect. president obama is set to speak next week at a mosque which was led for over a decade by an imam who justified suicide bombings in some circumstances and who helped found a mosque with ties to al qaeda.the president will visit the islamic society of baltimore on wednesday and deliver remarks there, the white house confirmed on saturday. this will be the first time the president has paid an official visit to a mosque during his seven years as president. however, obama has toured mosques while on overseas trips. the president believes that one of our nation s greatest strengths is our rich diversity, white house spokesman keith maley said, confirming reports. as the president has said, muslim americans are our friends, and neighbors; our co-workers, and sports heroes and our men and women in uniform defending our country. the council on american islamic relations (cair) which has been declared a terrorist organization in the united arab emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the holy land foundation s hamas-funding operation welcomed obama s decision. for a number of years we ve been encouraging the president to go to an american mosque, said cair spokesman ibrahim hooper. with the tremendous rise in anti-muslim sentiment in our country, we believe that it will send a message of inclusion and mutual respect. but critics of obama s decision may question his choice of the islamic society of baltimore, where mohamad adam el-sheikh, a native of sudan and former member of the muslim brotherhood, led the institution for eighteen years as its imam.before becoming imam there, el-sheikh helped found the muslim american society, an outfit created by muslim brotherhood members.in 2004, he told the washington post, commenting on palestinian suicide bombers: if certain muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued fatwas to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle. el-sheikh also helped found the dar al-hijrah mosque, which was once led by the deceased infamous al qaeda terrorist anwar al awlaki.when he left the islamic society of baltimore, el sheikh became the imam of dar al-hijrah, following awlaki s escape from the u.s. after the september 11 attacks.the dar al-hijrah mosque was founded thanks, in part, to a large grant from saudi arabia s embassy in the united states, which allowed for the large facility to accommodate some 5,000 muslims.dar al-hijrah, which is located right outside washington, d.c., is connected to several high-profile islamic terrorists who prayed there, including major nidal hassan the ft. hood massacre jihadi, two september 11 hijackers, and an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 world trade center bombing.via: breitbart news",1,27,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,18.102962962962966,22.651851851851855,0.0,0.0
fantastic! trump's 7 point plan to reform healthcare begins with a bombshell! » 100percentfedup.com,"email healthcare reform to make america great again since march of 2010, the american people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the affordable care act—obamacare. this legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the house and senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan president in american history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don’t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. as it appears obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the democrats and president obama, and abetted by the supreme court, will be difficult to repair unless the next president and a republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. congress must act. our elected representatives in the house and senate must: 1. completely repeal obamacare. our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. no person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 2. modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. as long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. by allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 3. allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn’t congress allow individuals the same exemptions? as we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. we must review basic options for medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. trending on 100% fed up",1,14,0.0,2,0,0,0.0,8.541538461538462,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0

"re: election not over? money is being raised to challenge the election results in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania","michael on television election not over? money is being raised to challenge the election results in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania 23rd, 2016 just when you thought it was safe to celebrate trump’s victory, the left is hatching a plan to try to steal the election right from under his nose. a group composed of “prominent computer scientists” and “election lawyers” is urgently asking the clinton campaign to challenge the election results in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania. they claim that there is “persuasive evidence” that the election results in those states were “manipulated or hacked”, and they are pushing clinton to file formal challenges to those results while there is still time to do so. as i write this article, the final result in michigan could still go either way, and if hillary clinton does end up winning michigan all she would have to do would be to flip the results in wisconsin and pennsylvania to become the next president of the united states. many on the left are absolutely incensed that donald trump is going to be the next president even though it looks like hillary clinton is going to win the popular vote by a very wide margin. in fact, as i write this article hillary clinton’s lead in the popular vote has expanded to more than 1.8 million votes . after all of the votes have been counted, it is entirely possible that hillary clinton may finish more than 2 million votes ahead of donald trump. in a desperate bid to try to salvage the election, an attempt is being made to push for recounts in the key swing states that clinton lost. this is being talked about all over the mainstream media today, but it was first reported by new york magazine … hillary clinton is being urged by a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers to call for a recount in three swing states won by donald trump , new york has learned. the group, which includes voting-rights attorney john bonifaz and j. alex halderman, the director of the university of michigan center for computer security and society, believes they’ve found persuasive evidence that results in wisconsin, michigan, and pennsylvania may have been manipulated or hacked . the group is so far not speaking on the record about their findings and is focused on lobbying the clinton team in private. last thursday, the activists held a conference call with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and campaign general counsel marc elias to make their case, according to a source briefed on the call. the academics presented findings showing that in wisconsin, clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. based on this statistical analysis, clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lost wisconsin by 27,000. the race in michigan is even closer, and the truth is that clinton may be able to close the gap of about 11,000 votes there without a recount. in pennsylvania, the gap is currently about 68,000 votes, and so that would present much more of a challenge for the clinton campaign. at this point it is questionable whether hillary clinton is willing to formally request recounts in those states before the deadlines arrive, but she doesn’t have to be the one to do it. in fact, according to msn another presidential candidate is already raising the money needed to submit her own requests for recounts in those key battleground states… jill stein, the green party’s presidential candidate, is prepared to request recounts of the election result in several key battleground states, her campaign said on wednesday. stein launched an online fundraising page seeking donations toward a $2m fund she said was needed to request reviews of the results in michigan, pennsylvania and wisconsin. stein said she was acting due to “compelling evidence of voting anomalies” and that data analysis had indicated “significant discrepancies in vote totals”. but if stein wants to do something, she needs to act very quickly. the deadline to officially file for a recount in wisconsin is friday, in pennsylvania it is monday, and in michigan it is next wednesday. meanwhile, six former bernie sanders supporters are engaged in a last ditch effort to use the electoral college to deny trump the presidency on december 19th. just like the attempt to recount the votes in key battleground states, this plan is not likely to work either, but right now it is receiving a lot of attention from the mainstream media. the following comes from a daily caller article entitled “ sanders electors vow to vote against clinton in wild attempt to keep trump from white house “… the group asserts that in order to succeed in their goal, they would have to convince 37 republican electors to vote against trump, a number the groups understands is unlikely. the ultimate goal, the group says, is to reduce the overall faith the average american voter has in the electoral college system. until the actual votes are tallied, it will be very difficult for either democrats or republicans to ascertain just how effective the movement is, because there is no organized whip effort to gauge how many electors intend to vote they way they are instructed. there is no remedy for a faithless elector. it is extremely unlikely that 37 republican electors would betray trump at this point. what is far more likely is that these former bernie sanders supporters will bring enough attention to “faithless electors” that it will cause an even bigger push to abolish the electoral college. but because it would require changing the constitution in order to abolish the electoral college, it is something that is not likely to happen any time soon. ultimately, all of these last minute moves by the left seem destined to fail, and there doesn’t seem to be anything that they can do at this point to keep donald trump out of the white house. and the truth is that so many of the things that i warn are coming to america in my new book are far more likely to happen if trump is in the white house rather than if a democrat is residing there. we have reached a critical moment in u.s. history, and right now optimism about the future of this country among conservatives is off the charts . but is that optimism justified? we shall see, but without a doubt this optimism is not shared by democrats, and many on the left are preparing to fight against trump every step of the way. november 23rd, 2016 | tags: 2016 , 2017 , debt , debts , donald trump , extreme pain , intense pain , lawyers , michigan , pain , painful , pennsylvania , trump , wisconsin | category: commentary half of the population of the world is dirt poor – and the global elite want to keep it that way » cinderella man fear mongering…it’s not gonna happen jeez there’s no way in hell they steal this from us..they think protests from leftist crybabies is bad just wait and see 60 million pissed off deplorables not gonna happen james staten",1,18,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,14.711111111111112,0.0,0.0

indonesia arrests nine with alleged islamic state links,"jakarta (reuters) - indonesian authorities arrested nine men suspected of having links to a militant network loyal to islamic state and planning a series of attacks on police posts, said a police spokesman. counter-terrorism police have grappled with a recent resurgence in homegrown radicalism in the world s largest muslim-majority country, inspired by extremist group islamic state. police said eight men were arrested on tuesday in riau province and one man in south sulawesi province. they were alleged to have links to indonesia s most high-profile militant network jemaah asharut daulah (jad) which is loyal to islamic state. they were planning attacks on police stations from the district level all the way to the provincial level, national police spokesman rikwanto said of the men arrested in riau. he added that the men were suspected of joining a training camp in a neighboring province where they learned to shoot guns and assemble bombs. detachment 88, the country s elite counter-terrorism police unit usually steps up surveillance and raids near the end of the year, foiling militant plots targeting new year s eve and christmas celebrations and popular tourist spots. authorities suspect there are hundreds of islamic state sympathizers in indonesia, some of whom have traveled to syria to fight alongside the group. there are heightened concerns over the return of battle-hardened militants as islamic state loses territory in the middle east. four people were killed when islamic state-linked militants launched a gun-and-bomb attack in the heart of the capital jakarta in january, 2016.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.655000000000001,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
trump expected to pick investor wilbur ross as u.s. commerce secretary,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president-elect donald trump is expected to name wilbur ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries, to head the commerce department, a republican source familiar with the decision told reuters on tuesday. an announcement on ross to lead the department, which pursues anti-dumping cases against cheap foreign imports, could come as early as wednesday, nbc news said. ross declined to comment to reuters on tuesday. ross, 78, a staunch supporter of trump and an economic adviser, has helped shape the trump campaign’s views on trade policy, blaming the 1994 north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico and the 2001 entry of china into the world trade organization for causing massive u.s. factory job losses. “i think there’s a big difference between the impact of trade agreements on corporate america and the impact on mr. and mrs. america,” ross told cnbc in an interview earlier this year. “corporate america has adjusted to them by investing lots of capital offshore.” ross, whose net worth was pegged by forbes at about $2.9 billion, heads the private equity firm, w.l. ross & co in new york. ross’ connections to trump date back to 1990, when as a turnaround expert for rothschild and co he worked on behalf of bondholders to help engineer a restructuring of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt owed on trump’s taj mahal casino in atlantic city, new jersey. in 2002, by then in charge of his own private equity firm, ross formed international steel group to consolidate several bankrupt steelmakers, including bethlehem steel, acme steel and ltv steel. he sold the company in a $4.5 billion deal two years later to mittal steel. ross retains a stake in what is now part of the world’s largest steel company, arcelor mittal, and sits on its board of directors. his various business interests, which also include automotive components and textiles, could make avoiding conflicts of interest a complicated prospect as the head of an agency with broad influence over trade cases and u.s. industrial policies. arcelor mittal has benefited from several recent anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposed by the commerce department against a wide range of steel products from china, south korea, japan, britain, turkey and other countries. those have helped lift domestic steel prices, boosting the company’s bottom line. ross may also face questions from lawmakers over the january 2006 sago coal mine disaster in west virginia that killed 12 miners in an explosion and collapse. owned by a subsidiary of one of his companies, international coal group, the mine had been cited for more than 200 safety violations international coal was sold for $3.4 billion in 2011 to no. 2 u.s. coal miner arch coal, which filed for bankruptcy protection in january amid plummeting coal prices. he could be questioned as well over a $2.3 million fine his firm agreed to pay in august to the securities and exchange commission to settle accusations it did not properly disclose some fees that it charged investors.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.154545454545456,15.30909090909091,0.0,0.0
"rouhani says iran will keep producing missiles, state tv reports","dubai (reuters) - iran will continue to produce missiles for its defense and does not consider that a violation of international accords, president hassan rouhani said on sunday in a speech broadcast on state television. rouhani spoke days after the u.s. house of representatives voted for new sanctions against iran s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement. he also meet the head of the u.n. nuclear watchdog in tehran, who again vouched for iran s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from u.s. president donald trump. we have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements, rouhani said in a speech in parliament. the united states has already imposed unilateral sanctions on iran, saying its missile tests violate a u.n. resolution, that calls on tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles. rouhani also criticized the united states over trump s refusal this month to formally certify that tehran is complying with the accord on iran s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is. you are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the u.n. security council and expect others to negotiate with you? rouhani said. because of the behavior it has adopted, america should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries, rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in east asia, an apparent reference to north korea. yukiya amano, the director general of the international atomic energy agency (iaea), met rouhani, president of the atomic energy organisation of iran ali akbar salehi, and foreign minister mohammad javad zarif in tehran, an iaea statement said. director general amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by iran are being implemented, and that the jcpoa represents a clear gain from a verification point of view, it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord. for the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the jcpoa sustainable. trump s decision not to certify iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between iran and six world powers means congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the agreement that amano s agency is in charge of policing. iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has said tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will shred the deal if washington pulls out, as trump has threatened to do. u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley has pressed the iaea to seek access to iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal. asked whether amano had made any requests for new inspections, salehi said after meeting amano: he has no request in this area, iran s state news agency irna reported. salehi said iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the iran deal to fall apart. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on saturday that he could not imagine the united states ever accepting a nuclear north korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to asia that diplomacy was america s preferred course.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.190000000000001,8.0,0.0,0.1
trump and kelly ’dismantle’ obama’s ’progress’ for illegal immigrants,"a former obama administration official responsible for the detention of illegal immigrants said president donald trump and department of homeland security (dhs) secretary john kelly are “dismantling the progress we had made. ”[kevin landy, president barack obama’s director of immigration and customs enforcement (ice) office of detention policy and planning, took exception to president’s trump’s decision to shut down his department. under secretary kelly, the dhs is poised to change some of the conditions illegal immigrants, including criminals, receive while in detention. as an example, illegal immigrants in two orange county, california, detention facilities have daily clothing and bedding changes performed by a jail employee. the standard for other criminal facilities is a weekly change. “that one seems a little overkill,” detaining center commander jon j. briggs told the new york times. “jail is jail,” butler county, ohio, sheriff richard jones told the new york newspaper. “it’s fair and it’s human, but we don’t put chocolates on the pillows. ” landy reacted to the trump administration’s efforts to toughen standards in the detention centers and claimed, “a decision to simultaneously abandon detention standards could have disastrous consequences for the health and safety of these individuals. ” he said he hoped secretary kelly, “wouldn’t want to dismantle the progress we had made,” but didn’t really detail what “progress” he was referencing. the new york times detailed some of the “progress” he might have been referencing. the ever growing list of requirements call for: notify immigration officials if a detainee spends two weeks or longer in solitary confinement. check on suicidal inmates every 15 minutes, and evaluate their mental health every day. inform detainees, in languages they can understand, how to obtain medical care. in disciplinary hearings, provide a staff member who can advocate in english on the detainee’s behalf. ice officials declined to comment on landy’s claims, stating only that the agency responsible for enforcing immigration law is “in the midst of examining a variety of detention models to determine which models would best meet anticipated detention needs. ” the clinton administration established the initial standards in 2000. since that time, they expanded under president george w. bush in 2008 and again under president obama in 2011. the current guidelines now fill 455 pages and go into “granular detail on subjects including the minimum number of toilets — one for every 12 detainees in male facilities or eight detainees in female facilities — and trash bag thickness (at least 1. 5 millimeters),” the new york times reported. with the crackdown on criminal aliens and other deportable individuals under the trump administration, more detention facilities will be required and costs will be an increasing concern. commander briggs told the reporter from the new york times the trump administration has already requested 500 additional beds. they warned that more will be coming in the months ahead. the commander said he currently can take only 120 at this time. breitbart texas managing director and brandon darby contributed to this article. bob price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for breitbart texas. he is a founding member of the breitbart texas team. follow him on twitter @bobpricebbtx and facebook.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.520000000000003,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0

viral nasa photographs show mysterious blue sphere in front of the sun,"on november 17, nasa’s stereo satellites photographed a giant blue sphere moving in front of the sun. the strange images quickly went viral and the internet is full of theories trying to explain the highly unusual occurrence. is the blue star kachina finally here? the mysterious image was first uploaded to facebook by pamela johnson and immediately received the attention it deserved. intrigued by the appearance of the sphere, she dug deeper and quickly made some troubling findings. although nasa’s archives contained images of the enigmatic sphere taken on november 17, several frames were missing from the feed; images taken on november 15 and november 16 were nowhere to be found. does this scream ‘nasa cover-up’ or not? one youtube user commented: “i have downloaded the images from secchi hi1 and this is strange. this ‘anomaly’ can only be seen on images from 11.17. but there are several missing frames both before and after its appearance.” the stereo (solar terrestrial relations observatory) satellite array is officially meant to study the “structure and evolution of solar storms” but in this case it was able to provide us with what some call definitive proof of a massive and unknown presence in our solar system. what’s more intriguing is the fact that the image was uploaded to nasa’s science center servers without any accompanying explanation. furthermore, as pamela johnson pointed out, nasa tried to cover their mistake by trying “to use euvi 171 images of the sun to hide the sphere.” not good. when things started going south, nasa forwarded an official explanation that failed to sway the belief of conspiracy theorists: “on rare occasions, the secchi image processor on board stereo becomes overloaded, and produces corrupted images,” nasa explained. “because the images from the heliospheric imager (hi) telescopes are built up from a large number of exposures added together, this sometimes results in ‘double exposures,’ where data from several telescopes appear in the same image.” watch the video: not taking nasa’s word for it, the internet floated other explanations out there. ufo hunters are convinced the blue sphere was actually an enormous ufo and due to its sheer size, it could have been responsible for the missing frames by creating an electromagnetic anomaly. when it left the area, the satellites resumed their normal activity. “whether the object is one of the giant extraterrestrial or interdimensional spacecraft, which are accessing our solar system, using the sun as a stargate or an unknown celestial body like the famed planet nibiru, it is clear what happened on the 17th was not the result of an equipment failure,” one conspiracy theorist wrote. others believe the strange sphere was actually the result of malevolent human beings, an expression of the infamous blue beam project. this perverse and apocalyptic-inclined venture –if real– would seek to cause mayhem among earth’s population by instilling fear and simulating the thing we all fear most: doomsday. if this theory is correct, one logical conclusion would be that nasa is either in cahoots with or being run by the nwo. other theories attempting to explain the blue sphere mention nibiru or an enormous stargate; both possibilities are ominous and disconcerting. but there could be another meaning behind this incident and, as far as i know, it hasn’t been forwarded yet. an ancient hopi prophecy states that “when the blue star kachina makes its appearance in the heavens, the fifth world will emerge.” it also speaks about the manifestation of nine signs foretelling this world-changing event. could it be happening right now? the hopi (meaning peaceful people) have been living in northeastern arizona since they can remember and are believed to be descendants from cultures to the south, east and north. the anasazi are forefathers of the hopi, which creates a direct link to the ancient aztec culture. though many civilizations around the globe support religious beliefs of “white gods” descending from the sky, the hopi tribe believe their ancestors came from within the ground. one of the many hopi myths specifically describes strange beings who reside inside the heart of the earth and are called the ant people. drawings displaying the ant people firmly resemble illustrations found in modern grey alien encounter reports. another connection exists between the hopi’s ant people and the mesoamerican legend of quetzalcoatl. it is believed that the ant people had helped the “white god” discover corn on a mountain packed full of grain and seeds. the hopi believe the star people and their star knowledge will return at the end of the current period of time, as they have in past times. their entire mythology is built upon the assumption that the world goes through successive cycles separated by cataclysmic events. according to their legends, at the time of the blue kachina, the star people retreated to the heart of the earth, seeking shelter during the world’s destruction. passed down from generation to generation, their intriguing mythology describes the event: first, the blue kachina would start to be seen at the dances, and would make his appearance known to the children in the plaza during the night dance. this event would tell us that the end times are very near. then the blue star kachina would physically appear in our heavens which would mean that we were in the end times.” when the first world was destroyed, people returned from the ground to the outer world to live as ants for the continuation of the second world. the third world tells of an advanced civilization with “flying shields” and wars between far – off cities ultimately destroyed by terrible floods, narratives very similar to those found in babylonian mythology. hopi indians are now wardens of the fourth world in exchange for the benefit of living on earth. they consider the coming of the fifth world is near and will begin when members of the fire clan return. “in the final days we will look up in our heavens and we will witness the return of the two brothers who helped create this world in the birthing time. poganghoya is the guardian of our north pole and his brother palongawhoya is the guardian of the south pole.” “in the final days the blue star kachina will come to be with his nephews and they will return the earth to its natural rotation which is counterclockwise. not far behind the twins will come the purifier – the red kachina, who will bring the day of purification. on this day the earth, her creatures and all life as we know it will change forever.” the legend of the blue kachina also corresponds with mayan prophecies and the planet – x theory, suggesting an interdependence between hopi assumptions and those of the mayan civilization. furthermore, another link is formed between the hopi legend of pahana and the mesoamerican myth of quetzalcoatl, connecting the hopi to certain north american indian cultures who worship the horned/feathered serpent. other ancient mysteries tend to relate with many genesis stories and religious beliefs of other archaic civilizations in both south and north america. the hopi claim that four stone tablets of creation exist. in ancient times, these tablets were given to them by massau – the guardian of the underworld, who requested that the tablets be kept until a number of signs were fulfilled at the end of the fourth world and the beginning of the fifth. when the signs appeared, the hopi were advised to reveal the tablets and their prophecies to the world regarding the purification of earth. the nine signs of destruction were described by author bob frissell in something in this book is true. the signs were described to him in 1958 by a hopi elder named white feather. this is the first sign: we are told of the coming of the white-skinned men, like pahana, but not living like pahana, men who took the land that was not theirs. and men who struck their enemies with thunder. this is the second sign: our lands will see the coming of spinning wheels filled with voices. in his youth, my father saw this prophecy come true with his eyes. this is the third sign: a strange beast like a buffalo but with great long horns will overrun the land in large numbers. these white feather saw with his eyes. this is the fourth sign: the land will be crossed by snakes of iron. this is the fifth sign: the land shall be crisscrossed by a giant spider’s web. this is the sixth sign: the land shall be crisscrossed with rivers of stone that make pictures in the sun. this is the seventh sign: you will hear of the sea turning black, and many living things dying because of it. this is the eighth sign: you will see many youth, who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom. the ninth sign , as white feather told frissell, is a herald of destruction: “you will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a great crash. it will appear as a blue star. very soon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease. many believe the first eight signs have already been fulfilled. the first sign can be interpreted as the arrival of europeans on the north american continent. the second is a reference to the early exploration of america, using the wagon as a primary means of locomotion. the next three signs point to other european influences, such as the arrival of cattle, and the emergence of railroads and telephone lines. the “rivers of stones” mentioned in the sixth sign can only be roads and highways. the eight sign is pretty self-explanatory and encapsulates the symptoms of worldwide pollution. the hopi believe the increased toxicity levels in the earth’s oceans are a clear indication that the second-to-last sign is already upon us. is this yet another wrongfully-interpreted prophecy, a metaphoric cow milked to exhaustion by authors with no other interest than to sell their books? or are the peaceful hopi really the keepers of ancient sacred knowledge, passed down from a time when man walked alongside the gods? the first eight signs have come and passed and the hopi are waiting for the blue kachina as a signal that the current world is nearing its end. if they were to see the recent nasa image, what would they say? ufoholic source",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.773333333333333,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0
legal fears push newsweek to delete eichenwald’s articles used to smear sputnik news,"21st century wire says failing us magazine newsweek once again finds itself on the ropes.for the last year, us mainstream media outlets have given themselves license to freely spray any and all slanderous accusations regarding russia into the public domain, and about russian-based media outlets in particular. one of the primary motivations for this festival of defamation is of course political. early on in the general election the russian conspiracy theory was promulgated by the white house and the clinton campaign and the mainstream media in order to damage trump s credibility. after clinton s epic loss, legions of democratic party affiliated journalists and hillary clinton supporters in the media are still angry and upset about their election loss and do not accept donald trump as their president. as a result, many journalists are still using their positions in media to act out in public, and mostly with the full backing of their like-minded editors and media executives.while most of the endless scapegoating and lies about russia and trump continue as annoying background noise, some of the us liberal establishment s fake news and libelous claims, like stories made-up by cnn are beginning to be challenged in the courts which is causing a panic on many mainstream editorial news desks across america.this latest challenge to newsweek and its shamed staff writer kurt eichenwald follows on the current blow-back trend line rt international reports sputnik and rt editor-in-chief margarita simonyan commented on the removal by newsweek of false stories about trump conspiring with russia, saying it deleted the lies about us, fearing court proceedings. we ll continue explaining to various newsweeks that lying is bad, simonyan told sputnik.her comments come after newsweek was forced to take down two erroneous articles by journalist kurt eichenwald, claiming that us president donald trump had conspired with russia, as well as smearing former sputnik editor william moran.on friday, moran said that a settlement had been reached, but did not provide any further details, saying that the deal was confidential between the two sides.in october, moran mistakenly attributed an article by eichenwald to clinton confidant sidney blumenthal and, realizing his mistake, deleted the article 20 minutes later. however, while the piece was online, eichenwald saw it and imagined collusion between the trump campaign, sputnik, and wikileaks.at the time, numerous media outlets (some usually quite critical of russia) spoke out against eichenwald. the washington post said that eichenwald is at best misleading, while buzzfeed proved that trump and moran quoted the same erroneous tweet, which was widespread online.moran then contacted eichenwald, attempting to clarify the situation and expecting eichenwald to retract the story.that, however, did not happen. instead, eichenwald asked him to stay silent in exchange for a job as political reporter with the new republic, and warned him about the potential consequences if the young journalist refused. moran turned down the offer and went public with his version of events.moran has left the field of journalism and is currently pursuing a law degree, sputnik news agency said. newsweek is an established brand of 80 years and yet it is not even in sputnik s league in terms of global web traffic and performance, patrick henningsen, geopolitical analyst and executive editor at 21stcenturywire.com, said. news outlets like rt and sputnik are winning in the ratings battle with many us and uk english language media platforms, he said, and explained why this is happening. it is simply because the russia-based english language outlets are filling a demand for real international news and edgy opinion. they are simply feeding a massive audience out there which has been intentionally neglected for decades by western establishment media conglomerates who have always enjoyed a monopoly on the global english language market. a network like rt, and a website like sputnik, are only filling a demand which was always there. read more about msm disinformation at: 21st century wire media cog filessupport 21wire subscribe & become a member @21wire.tv",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.633846153846157,8.276923076923078,0.0,0.0
another us false flag?,"by joachim hagopian october 29, 2016 the western media seizes every chance to twist the truth in favor of another round of putin-bashing as it’s worn out flimsy excuse to escalate further hostilities against moscow in order to trigger world war iii. the pathological liars of the west never fail to deceitfully add fuel to their propaganda war machine fire. the latest hype is blaming a russian airstrike for destroying a school in the rebel-held idlib province in northern syria, killing 22 children and six teachers. immediately the un as the washington vassal it is, through the united nations children’s fund (unicef) for added sensational effect no less began opportunistically milking the tragedy for all it‘s worth, denouncing the killing as “an outrage” and probable war crime, adding that it’s the deadliest attack on a school in the near six years syrian conflict. what’s being left out of this heavily biased narrative is that the war in syria was maliciously started by the united states, specifically, the cia funding protests in 2011 (actually as far back as 2005 ) targeting assad as part of its infamous arab spring uprising in accordance with empire’s illegal regime change policy. as an independent, secular leader unwilling to succumb to empire’s pressure to allow a 2009 proposed qatar gas pipeline to europe be built through his country, the fixated neocons have been gunning for assad’s removal ever since. russian defense ministry spokesman major general igor konashenkov explained that after closer examination and careful analysis, the video released to western media allegedly depicting the airstrike in idlib province consists of more than ten separate pieces of footage fragmented together. thus, it appears to be a hoax designed to incriminate the russian aerospace group for killing innocent kids. he added: as one can see on a photo from the russian drone, the roof of the school is not damaged and there are no bomb craters in the area adjacent to the school… all this means that the unicef leadership fell a victim to a new deception of swindlers in white helmets. that is why, before making loud statements, unicef officials should check sources of their information in order not to undermine the reputation of a respected organization. of course this latest false flag isn’t the first time russia’s been falsely blamed for attacks in syria. through cia and military intelligence, the west has an elaborate network of anti-russian and anti-assad provocateurs waging staged events to implicate and vilify putin and assad as the enemy. general konashenkov mentioned the white helmets as part of the organized setup of us false flag operations in syria. a former uk military intelligence officer owns the private security company responsible for training and handling the so-called white helmets, discredited syrian provocateurs pretending to be syria’s civil defense corps regularly staging fake photo-ops after us-backed terrorist groups kill innocent civilians making it appear that assad and putin are willfully and inhumanely murdering them. this latest school tragedy appears no different as incident after incident has been exposed in recent months. like last month’s attack on that un humanitarian aid convoy north of aleppo several weeks ago, engineered by western intelligence working with the terrorists to accuse russia of yet another airstrike that didn’t happen, covering up the a rocket attack perpetrated by the us-backed al nusra front (forget their recent name change designed to distance themselves from being us proxy war terrorists no different from al qaeda or isis/daesh/islamic state). bottom line, terrorists-r-us, inc . in this latest propaganda ploy, on-the-ground eyewitness reports vis-à-vis white helmets state that 10 airstrikes around midday on wednesday were responsible for striking the residential compound containing two schools in session at the time resulting in the bloodbath. of course the go-to propagandist organization out of london that the western media never fails to quote, the already outed fraudulent syrian observatory for human rights consisting of one anti-assad expatriated syrian, began immediately pointing the finger at russia, like clinton, obama and all the western axis-of-evil liars determined to demonize putin and russia as false justification for starting their next world war . in response to the tragedy, russian foreign ministry spokesperson maria zakharova on thursday called for an urgent international investigation without delay. she had this reaction to the western presstitutes blaming her nation: this is not surprising, but at the same time, it deserves the strongest criticism. al-jazeera, the independent, and other mass media sharing the same attitude to the journalistic profession at once blamed the tragedy on russia, on the russian aerospace group and on the syrian armed forces. they claimed outright that it was a bombardment carried out by russia and syria. this is a lie. russia has nothing to with that terrible tragedy, with that attack. zakharova also mentioned a concern that the un humanitarian relief in syria has not nearly been enough to evacuate the wounded and sick from east aleppo after russia and syria agreed to a humanitarian pause there several days ago. however, us backed rebels and snipers fired on civilians attempting to leave the city. moreover, the us took full advantage of the lull in the russian-syrian fighting by opportunistically resupplying their terrorists on the ground with 50-ton airdrops of fresh ammo and weapons. again, clearly it’s the us that’s the war crime culprit, needlessly causing only more war and more deaths in the war-ravaged nation reeling from nearly a half million lives lost. another reality check for the washington neocon war maniacs determined to blame russia for all the ills of the world (including the corrupt us political system responsible for the rigged election ) as their deceptive sleight of hand brainwash to feebly cover up their own slaughterhouse carnage raping our planet, just one day prior to the idlib school violence, the beirut branch of amnesty international (ai) chastised the us-led coalition pretending to fight the terrorists for its wanton killing of civilians in syria as “collateral war damage.” the inhumanities that empire commits is never admitted or acknowledged but instead constant lies claiming that russian and syrian forces are cold-bloodedly mowing down innocents continue nonstop. the hubris and hypocrisy stemming from washington’s rotten core are american exceptionalism at its diabolical worse. deputy director for research at the beirut amnesty international office lynn maalouf , stated: it’s high time the us authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in syria. we fear the us-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in syria. ai estimates that in 11 us coalition airstrikes since september 2014 killed more than 300 civilians in syria. maalouf maintains that in each case, “the coalition forces failed to take adequate precautions to minimize harm to civilians and damage to civilian objects.” so who’s really the inhumane kid-killing bad guy in syria? definitely not russia nor the syrian government but once again the enemy of the world us empire. ultimately to silence this never-ending us blame game against moscow, the russian ambassador to the un on thursday began circulating the original september 9 th us-russian peace treaty to the unsecurity council as well as to the un geneva branch. this document clearly shows that russia has exhausted every sincere effort to bring an end to the war in syria and stop global terrorism but the united states and its western lackeys have willfully and deceitfully sabotaged that process at every turn in order to save their precious terrorists and endless war on terror. the evildoers behind the lifted curtain are exposed and guilty as charged. or how can we forget the obama staged false flag attack in august 2013 when the liar-in-chief falsely blamed assad for sarin gassing his own syrian children in the nearby damascus suburb of ghouta . despite the real child murderers being obama and his backed rebels he and hillary created soon to be named isis, the manchurian president given the mission to destroy america and his then recently resigned secretary of state designated to be his successor to finish the job were trying to launch airstrikes on syria to start world war iii over three years ago. putin outsmarted the us traitors in charge by brokering the last minute deal for assad to turn in his chemical weapons arsenal. but with white house approval, us-backed terrorists guilty of the ghouta massacre are still using their saudi and turkish supplied chemical weapons to kill syrian civilians even to this very day. where are the humanitarian cries about those war crime atrocities? or what about all the civilians dying in syria from mortar shelling of residential neighborhoods in west aleppo? a mere one day after the idlib school bombing, the us-backed al nusra fired rockets in two locations in west aleppo, one a school killing six children under the age of 16 and injuring more than a dozen others. in response to the thursday school bombing in west aleppo by us-backed terrorists, the aleppo police chief zuher said aldin commented: there are no military units there, only schools. nevertheless, militants carried out a strike in this area, moreover, when classes were underway. innocent children were killed, they just wanted to study. but where are all the humanitarian cries against the us financed and supported terrorists constantly murdering innocents throughout the middle east and north africa? conveniently absent, because the us plotters of wars around the world couldn’t care less about any dead children anywhere on this planet. or the 10,000 civilians in yemen slaughtered by the us-backed saudi coalition consisting of us special force boots on the ground and more al qaeda and isis terrorists deployed there as well, in addition to israeli and gulf state airstrikes and now us destroyers pounding the yemen coast killing more civilians with cruise missiles after yet more us false flag claims that the houthis fired missiles at the us navy without any evidence to prove it. where are the sanctimonious humanitarian cries over dead yemen children? this historic, incessant use of false flags designed to bring about yet more war, terror and carnage to further destabilize the world for empire hegemonic unipolar control needed to usher in the elite’s one world government tyranny that the puppet masters have been plotting for over a century has been and currently is washington’s fulltime modus operandi. because the globalists are getting desperate knowing that the world is now onto their demonic genocidal bloodletting and is now seeking justice and accountability in their relentless crimes against humanity, they’re racing against time to bring us all down with hillary as their rigged presidential choice launching wwiii and their preplanned global economy collapse as justification to finalize global governance using the climate change hoax and the trojan horse excuse of protecting survivors with agenda 2030 mass relocation as their prime vehicles to make it happen. by the way, this elitist plan includes preemptive nuclear first strikes against the eastern nuke powered nations russia and china while leaving humanity at the earth’s surface to die from fatal exposure to radioactive fallout. for decades they’ve been planning for this nightmarish endgame scenario, quietly building their subterranean luxury bunkered homes that include several years of survival supplies, deep underground military bases (dumb’s) and elaborate transcontinental transport systems. the best of joachim hagopian tags: joachim hagopian [ ] is a west point graduate and former us army officer. he has written a manuscript based on his unique

senate confirms huntsman as ambassador to russia,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. senate confirmed former utah governor jon huntsman on thursday to be president donald trump’s ambassador to russia, sending an experienced diplomat to fill the crucial post in moscow. the senate confirmed huntsman, who also served as ambassador to china under former democratic president barack obama, by voice vote. huntsman served as ambassador to singapore under former republican president george h.w. bush. the senate foreign relations committee had approved huntsman unanimously earlier this week, as members from both parties praised his qualifications and experience. the senate also confirmed three other diplomatic positions by voice vote: john bass, currently the u.s. ambassador to turkey, to be envoy to afghanistan; career diplomat justin siberell to be ambassador to bahrain and wess mitchell, a think-tank founder, to be assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs. huntsman takes on the post in moscow as congressional committees and special counsel robert mueller investigate allegations that russia sought to influence the 2016 u.s. presidential election on trump’s behalf, as well as potential collusion with moscow by trump associates. moscow denies such activity and trump dismisses any talk of collusion. huntsman said at his confirmation hearing that there was no question russia interfered during the 2016 campaign.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.740000000000002,8.514285714285714,0.0,0.0
watch: hitler explodes at trump campaign in hilarious video mocking white supremacist rage,"as white supremacists whine about donald trump s flip-flop on immigration, someone kindly created a video of adolf hitler going batshit crazy about it.during an interview with fox news host sean hannity, who has become the republican nominee s chief propagandist, trump backed away from his core promise to round up and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.of course, all of the racists who support trump s campaign immediately lost their small minds, with some even going so far as to threaten trump if he doesn t keep his original promise.ann coulter even threw a fit about it and complained that trump is talking about amnesty. so it looks like coulter and the rest of trump s hardcore supporters have lost a little trust in their candidate, which is hysterical since coulter s new book is titled in trump we trust.to mock trump s supporters, rino pundit used the hitler biopic film downfall and changed all of the subtitles to show the nazi leader furiously throwing a temper tantrum over trump s new immigration flap. hannity, coulter, reince priebus, chris christie, and matt drudge are all not spared from hitler s wrath in this hilarious video.it begins with one of hitler s advisers telling him that trump could get through a full week without committing a gaffe since coulter is starting her book tour.hitler is relieved that trump may finally be in the clear as long as he doesn t pivot on immigration too drastically. then he is told of trump s hannity interview. trump went full-blown amnesty on a hannity special, an adviser reluctantly informs the fuhrer.then the fun begins as hitler asks everyone who predicted that trump would flip-flop to leave the room. all but five leave. hitler then loses his shit and just about every major trump supporter gets mocked.here s the video via youtube.this is going to make every white supremacist in america throw a hissy fit. so thank you, rino pundit. we salute you.featured image via screen capture",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.172307692307694,14.430769230769233,0.0,0.0
obama finally takes action: kicks 35 russian diplomats out of u.s. over election tampering,"the obama administration is finally taking action after russia interfered in the presidential election. the white house has announced that 35 intelligence operatives are being ejected from the country. in addition, sanctions will be placed on russia s two leading intelligence services, including four top officers of the military intelligence unit.on thursday, obama signed an executive order which grants the president the authority to impose travel bans and asset freezes on those who tamper with, alter, or cause a misappropriation of information, with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions. the new york times reports:mr. obama used that order to immediately impose sanctions on four russian intelligence officials: igor valentinovich korobov, the current chief of a military intelligence agency, the g.r.u., and three deputies: sergey aleksandrovich gizunov, the deputy chief of the g.r.u.; igor olegovich kostyukov, a first deputy chief, and vladimir stepanovich alekseyev, also a first deputy chief of the g.r.u the administration also put sanctions on three companies and organizations that it said supported the hacking operations: the special technologies center, a signals intelligence operation in st. petersburg; a firm called zor security that is also known as esage lab; and the autonomous non-commercial organization professional association of designers of data processing systems, whose lengthy name, american officials said, was cover for a group that provided special training for the hacking.it is unclear at the moment how much of an impact these measures will actually have. the move may end up being largely symbolic, but as the times points out, the actions would amount to the strongest american response ever taken to a state-sponsored cyberattack aimed at the united states. u.s. intelligence agencies, including the cia, fbi, and department of homeland security, all agree that russia was behind the dnc hacks and the subsequent slow release of damaging information obtained in those hacks during the presidential campaign. they have also concluded that russia interfered with the election for one reason: to help donald trump defeat hillary clinton.trump has blown off the findings of the u.s. intelligence community as ridiculous. because the punishments obama imposed today are an executive order, trump will have the option of nixing the sanctions when he takes office next month. if he chooses to do so, it is likely that members of congress, including republicans, will be furious as they have been calling for an official investigation into the matter.the white house is also planning to release a joint analytic report from the fbi and the department of homeland security which will give more insight into the information that has been gathered by the national security agency. the report is expected to be published before obama leaves office in three weeks.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.89714285714286,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0

six dead after ambush on malian high court's president,"bamako (reuters) - five malian soldiers and one civilian were killed in central mali on tuesday during an ambush on a convoy of the president of the high court of justice, the defense ministry said in a statement. it was not clear who was responsible for the attack, but the high level target and army deaths point to the deteriorating security situation in mali due to the growing reach of jihadist groups that roam country s vast desert expanses. the convoy of abdrahamane niang was traveling between the towns of dia and diafarab in the mopti region, about 500 kilometers (311 miles) northeast of the capital bamako, when it was attacked. mr. niang and his wife were recovered by the army. however, we report 6 deaths: five soldiers of the malian army and the driver of the honorable niang, the statement said, adding that others had been wounded. no other details of the attack were given. the rise of jihadist groups some linked to al qaeda and islamic state continues to destabilize mali, four years after french troops beat back an islamist insurgency that began in 2012. around 4,000 french soldiers remain as part of operation barkhane, where they work alongside around 10,000 u.n. peacekeepers in mali. but attacks on peacekeepers, aid workers and the malian military are common. four u.s. special forces troops were killed earlier this month in neighboring niger by fighters believed to belong to a local islamic state affiliate operating out of mali. the g5 sahel, an anti-terrorism taskforce of soldiers from mali, niger, burkina faso, chad and mauritania, plans to launch its first joint operations this month to target islamists in the sahel.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.964444444444446,8.044444444444444,0.1111111111111111,0.0

hillary clinton freaked out her entire campaign with this one move,"pinterest it was over a year ago that the clinton campaign knew that hillary clinton had regularly used a private email server for official use, and they knew how incredibly stupid it was. in an email released by wikileaks , the now infamous clinton staffer john podesta sent a message to clinton surrogate neera tanden. podesta told her she’d be shown a new poll showing how clinton is doing against hillary and jeb bush. tanden said she wasn’t familiar with what the poll results would be, but she thought the email would be rough, ijr is reporting . “ps can you imagine what the republicans would do to [bernie] if he were the nominee?” to which tanden replied: “well, let’s see what the poll actually says. let’s hope the democratic party is not suicidal.” then podesta dropped the hammer: “do we actually know who told hillary she could use a private email? and has that person been drawn and quartered? like whole thing is fucking insane.” ""do we actually know who told hillary she could use a private email? and has that person been drawn and quartered?"" https://t.co/jxc1mhi5vn — jake tapper (@jaketapper) october 27, 2016 there have been 33,000 emails released from podesta’s server. they haven’t confirmed their accuracy, but they certainly haven’t denied them. it's been 3 weeks since @wikileaks began publishing podesta emails. not one doc has been claimed – let alone demonstrated – to be doctored. — glenn greenwald (@ggreenwald) october 27, 2016 there’s more coming. we will have to see what comes of them, but there’s one takeaway from this: clinton’s people have known for a long time that she was using a personal server.",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.09090909090909091,6.936363636363637,11.672727272727274,0.09090909090909091,0.0
u.s. vetoes u.n. call for withdrawal of trump jerusalem decision,"united nations (reuters) - the united states was further isolated on monday over president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital when it blocked a united nations security council call for the declaration to be withdrawn. the remaining 14 council members voted in favor of the egyptian-drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the united states or trump but which expressed deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of jerusalem. what we witnessed here in the security council is an insult. it won t be forgotten, u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said after the vote, adding that it was the first veto cast by the united states in more than six years. the fact that this veto is being done in defense of american sovereignty and in defense of america s role in the middle east peace process is not a source of embarrassment for us; it should be an embarrassment to the remainder of the security council, haley said. the u.n. draft resolution affirmed that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the holy city of jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the security council. trump abruptly reversed decades of u.s. policy this month when he recognized jerusalem as israel s capital, generating outrage from palestinians and the arab world and concern among washington s western allies. in the wake of the decision of the united states ... the situation has become more tense with an increase in incidents, notably rockets fired from gaza and clashes between palestinians and israeli security forces, u.n. middle east peace envoy nickolay mladenov told the security council ahead of the vote. trump also plans to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv. the draft u.n. resolution had called upon all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in jerusalem. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu thanked haley and trump for the veto in a video clip posted on his facebook page. israel considers jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. palestinians want the capital of an independent palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. following the u.s. veto, egypt s foreign ministry said arab states, which had agreed earlier this month to seek a security council resolution, would meet to evaluate the situation to determine what their next steps might be. palestinian foreign minister riyad al-maliki said the palestinians would seek a rare emergency special session of the 193-member u.n. general assembly on trump s decision. under a 1950 resolution, an emergency special session can be called for the general assembly to consider a matter with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures if the security council fails to act. only 10 such sessions have been convened, and the last time the general assembly met in such a session was in 2009 on israeli actions in occupied palestinian territories. any outcome of such a session is non-binding, but carries political weight.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.55,16.0,0.0,0.0
obama to focus on future in state of the union speech,"(cnn) as white house officials began preparing for president barack obama's final state of the union speech, they dug up past ""eighth-year"" speeches and found something in common -- nearly all of them looked back. it was tempting for the president to follow the lead of his predecessors, take a victory lap and mainly tout his administration's achievements. but obama's instruction to his team was simple: don't do that. ""don't take our foot off the gas,"" the president told a group of west wing aides and speechwriters preparing drafts of the speech, according to a senior white house official who attended meeting. as his top aides have described it, obama has chosen to deliver a ""nontraditional"" state of the union. gone is the laundry list of policy proposals funneled into the white house from agencies across the federal government. no more ""myra's,"" one official quipped, pointing to the previous idea for a new government savings account that was inserted into a past state of the union. ""it's not going to be 'check the box,' "" explained one senior white house official, insisting that the annual retrieval of recommendations from cabinet members will not be shoehorned into the speech. obama previewed his plan to talk about his vision for the future in a video teaser tweeted by white house chief of staff denis mcdonough. ""the big things that will guarantee an even stronger, better, more prosperous america for our kids. the america we believe in,"" obama said in the video. vision for u.s. leadership around the world one of those ""big things"" will be the president's vision for u.s. leadership in the world in the post-obama years. a senior white house official said obama will urge the nation to follow his preferred foreign policy approach of diplomacy and multilateralism. to illustrate that call, the president is likely to tout the administration's response to the ebola outbreak, the climate change agreement in paris and his decision to normalize relations with cuba. in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in paris and san bernardino, california, obama will also seek to reassure americans once again about their safety. senior administration officials said obama plans to devote part of the speech to his vow to protect the american home front and put the nation on a path to destroying isis, a mission aides concede likely won't be accomplished on his watch. the war on isis ""will be the overarching focus of everything we do this year,"" deputy national security adviser ben rhodes told reporters earlier this year. still, obama will dedicate much of the speech to his late second-term agenda. in the coming weeks, the president is expected to deliver a plan to congress for closing the terror detention center at guantanamo. obama will likely threaten to act on his own to shut down the facility if lawmakers balk at the proposal. in what will be an emotional high point in the speech, the president will also defend his executive actions aimed at tightening the nation's background check system for gun buyers. obama will then point to the first lady's box at the address where an empty seat will represent the victims of gun violence. still, a nod to the past given that this is obama's final state of the union, aides believe the president will still take a few moments to look back on his two terms in office, especially its tumultuous beginning. obama was sworn into office as the nation was on the verge of slipping into a second great depression, his aides often remind reporters. the president has already begun to recall his administration's handling of the financial crisis, pointing to the recovery of the u.s. auto industry in his weekly address to the nation on saturday. there will also be a heavy dose of nostalgia in obama's speech. inside the west wing, top officials who are veterans of the president's first campaign for the white house can hardly believe obama's time in office is almost up. in a nod to those one-time campaign aides who made the transition to the administration and the scores of volunteers during both election cycles, obama will point to edith childs, who will be sitting in the first lady's box during the speech. childs, a county council member in greenwood, south carolina, coined the popular chant, ""fired up! ready to go!"" at one of obama's rallies in 2007. then-sen. obama was so struck by the cheer it was adopted as an unofficial campaign slogan for the rest of his white house run. ""this is going to be an incredibly emotional moment,"" said van jones, a leading environmental official in obama's first administration and now a cnn political contributor. ""you think about speech after speech, and this is the last one. this is the last state of the union. and there's no deceleration in this guy. there's no deceleration. this is the guy that we voted for,"" jones added. despite that rich election lore waiting to be tapped, the president won't spend too much time reliving his election glory years, aides insist. top officials describe the graying but still youthful 54-year-old president as almost restless, eager to squeeze every moment he can from his remaining year in office. ""the question is what are the kinds of decisions that we are going to make right now that are going to ensure that we're going to pass on our to kids and their kids the most prosperous, the most secure, the most fair united states that has ever existed,"" white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters friday. house speaker paul ryan, who has also signaled an ambitious agenda for 2016, joked that obama should spend his final state of the union apologizing for his past policies. "" 'i take it all back -- that health care was wrong, we shouldn't have done dodd-frank, i want to actually lower tax rates, clear out crony capitalism and restore the constitution to its rightful place in american life.' that's what i would encourage him to say,"" quipped ryan.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.863636363636363,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0

"typhoon batters hong kong and south china, three dead in macau","hong kong (reuters) - typhoon hato, a maximum category 10 storm, slammed into hong kong on wednesday lashing the asian financial hub with wind and rain that uprooted trees and forced most businesses to close, while in some places big waves flooded seaside streets. there were reports of 34 people injured in hong kong while in the city of macau, across the pearl river estuary, three people were killed, authorities there said. in hong kong, more than 450 flights were canceled, financial markets suspended and schools closed as hato bore down, the first category 10 storm to hit the city since 2012. i ve never seen one like this, garrett quigley, a longtime resident of lantau island to the west of the city, said of the storm. cars are half submerged and roads are impassable with flooding and huge trees down. it s crazy. many skyscrapers in the usually teeming streets of hong kong were empty and dark as office workers stayed at home. hato, that means sky pigeon in japanese, churned up hong kong s victoria harbor and triggered large swells and big waves on some of the city s most popular beaches, with serious flooding in low-lying areas. in residential districts such as heng fa chuen on densely populated hong kong island, waves smashed against the sides of oceanfront buildings and surged over a promenade, sweeping away walls and benches and swamping vehicles parked nearby. construction cranes swayed at the tops of skyscrapers, windows imploded and nearly 200 trees were uprooted, while some people used canoes to venture out into flooded streets. authorities downgraded the storm to a category three by late-afternoon with government services, the courts, financial markets and companies set to resume normal business on thursday. the storm also caused a power blackout across most of the gambling hub of macau for about two hours, residents said, with disruption to mobile phone and internet networks. there was severe flooding on the streets, with some cars almost completely submerged, and the water supply was affected in some districts. the three men who died included a 45-year-old chinese tourist who was hit by a heavy truck, according to a government statement. the former portuguese colony s casinos, however, had backup power, two casino executives told reuters. the storm also made landfall in china s guangdong province, in zhuhai city adjacent to macau, chinese state news agency xinhua reported. numerous flights and trains were canceled in guangdong province, with shenzhen s international airport particularly badly hit. thousands of residents along the chinese coast were evacuated and fishing vessels were called back to port. maximum winds near hato s center were recorded at a destructive 155 kph (95 mph) as it continued to move west across guangdong in the general direction of hainan island. a senior scientific officer for the hong kong observatory warned that sea levels could rise several meters in some places, with the government issuing flood alerts and opening 27 shelters across the city. trading in hong kong s financial markets was halted for the day, the stock exchange said. typhoon nida in august last year was the last storm to close the exchange for the whole day. the city s flagship carrier, cathay pacific, and hong kong airlines said the majority of their flights to and from hong kong between 2200 gmt tuesday and 0900 gmt wednesday would be canceled. other transport services, including ferries to macau and outlying islands in hong kong, were suspended.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.790909090909089,4.4,0.09090909090909091,0.0

u.s. weighs whether to stay in iran nuclear deal,"united nations (reuters) - the united states said on wednesday it is weighing whether the iranian nuclear deal serves its security interests even as iran said it did not expect washington to abandon the agreement. a collapse of the 2015 deal, which u.s. president donald trump has called an embarrassment but which is supported by the other major powers that negotiated it with iran, could trigger a regional arms race and worsen middle east tensions. iranian president hassan rouhani vowed that his country would not be the first to violate the agreement under which tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the loosening of economic sanctions that had crippled its economy. we don t think trump will walk out of the deal despite (his) rhetoric and propaganda, rouhani told reporters on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly gathering of world leaders. he also ruled out the idea of renegotiating the pact. trump told reporters he had made a decision on what to do about the agreement but would not say what he had decided. matters were no clearer after iran and the world powers that negotiated the deal - britain, china, france, germany, russia and the united states - met for talks that a european source said included a long discussion between the u.s. and iranian foreign ministers. it was the first time that the two men, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif, had met since trump took office on jan. 20. the eu s foreign policy chief, federica mogherini, said all sides believed there had been no violations to the deal but she was unable to say after the roughly hour and 20-minute meeting whether the united states would stick to it. we already have one potential nuclear crisis. we definitely (do) not need to go into a second one, she told reporters, alluding to north korea s pursuit atomic weapons. asked if the united states had committed to staying in the pact, she appeared to be at a loss and said: another question. tillerson told reporters trump did not wish to leave the iran nuclear issue to the next president. that is the reason he is very, very carefully considering the decision of whether we find the jcpoa to continue to serve the security interests of the american people or not, he said, referring to the pact formally called the joint comprehensive plan of action. the u.s. president, who on tuesday called the deal one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the united states has ever entered into, told reporters he had made up his mind whether to keep the pact but declined to disclose his decision. trump must decide by oct. 15 whether to certify that iran is complying with the pact, a decision that could sink the deal. if he does not, the u.s. congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the accord. a senior u.s. official said trump is leaning toward not certifying that iran is complying with the pact and letting congress effectively decide whether to kill the agreement. the official said trump could always change his mind before the deadline and noted he publicly and privately has fumed about the deal, feeling the united states was taken advantage of. a source familiar with the u.s. discussions said the trump administration is also considering ways to leave the agreement intact, sanction iran for its missile tests and support for extremist groups, and then seek to strengthen the pact. the prospect of washington reneging on the agreement has worried some u.s. partners that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. french president emmanuel macron told reporters it would be a mistake to pull out of the pact. however, he also appeared to open the door for tougher action on iran, saying the deal was insufficient given iran s growing regional influence since 2015. is this agreement enough? no. it is not, given the evolution of the regional situation and increasing pressure that iran is exerting on the region, and given ... increased activity by iran on the ballistic level since the accord, he said. chinese foreign minister wang yi said the recent tension on the korean peninsula underlined the importance of the iranian deal, and that china would continue to support and safeguard it, chinese state media said. an official from a gulf nation suggested that his country could accept the deal s collapse. should trump either not certify iranian compliance or withdraw from the deal entirely, the gulf official said: i think we can live with that.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.964444444444446,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
$7 million in donations to go directly to orlando kin and survivors - the new york times,"orlando, fla. — the city announced friday that the $7 million it collected after the nightclub shooting would be given directly to family members and survivors instead of being distributed through charities and nonprofit groups. the change was necessary, mayor buddy dyer said, because survivors of the nightclub attack and relatives needed help immediately with expenses like rent and groceries. “we are working through exactly the way they are going to do that,” mr. dyer said. “the most important thing is to do it right, do it transparently and make sure our funders are comfortable with how we are doing this. ” a charitable and advocacy organization, the national center for victims of crime, which is based in washington, had criticized orlando’s plan to distribute money via nonprofits, saying that too little money donated in that manner had made its way to victims and their families after similar tragedies. of the $7 million collected for the oneorlando fund, mr. dyer said, $6. 5 million came from corporations. with the move, orlando is the latest to shift away from established charities and opt for direct donations, a move that has become increasingly common, in part because of questions about how some charities use donations. the shooting early sunday at pulse, a gay nightclub, left 49 people dead and more than 50 wounded. the gunman, omar mateen, 29, claimed allegiance to the islamic state during a phone call to the authorities in the midst of the attack. mr. mateen was killed in a gunfight. here in orlando, the families of victims are already receiving help with funerals and airfare, mr. dyer said. in puerto rico, a representative of the governor’s office said each family was receiving $7, 500 to bury loved ones. mr. dyer made the announcement at the camping world stadium, once known as the citrus bowl, where 35 agencies have set up to offer services to the family members. already 94 families and 256 people have received help, mr. dyer said. the city has also established a board led by alex martins, chief executive of the orlando magic basketball team, to develop a plan to distribute the money. the outpouring for orlando has raised millions through traditional charities and online campaigns, including through crowdfunding websites. on one such site, gofundme, more than 300 campaigns have raised $6. 2 million, including $5. 2 million by equality florida, an advocacy group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, a gofundme spokesman, dan pfeiffer, said. “there is a real power to being able to give to an individual story and being able to follow that story,” mr. pfeiffer said. “it is the power of those individual stories. ” charity officials said the individual campaigns were also a reflection of the public’s concern that their donations get to the people for which they were intended. after the terrorist attacks in september 2001, the american red cross came under intense criticism for collecting millions of dollars in the name of the victims and then making plans to use the money elsewhere. eventually, the red cross agreed to use all of its $543 million liberty disaster fund to assist those affected by the attacks. specialists in charitable giving said orlando’s decision could alter how local governments handle the sudden outpouring of money from the public after natural disasters like hurricane katrina and mass shootings like the one in newtown, conn. “there have been so many scandals we’ve seen after these sorts of situations, so it is a big deal that they’ve bypassed nonprofits because it shows a distrust in how nonprofits are doing things,” said stacy palmer, editor of the chronicle of philanthropy. “this sends a big message, too, because other cities might decide to use this as a model in the future. ” mai fernandez, executive director of the national center for victims of crime, said friday that the group, as well as some family members, had told city officials that they feared donations from oneorlando would not get to victims if a traditional nonprofit was placed in charge. the organization founded a charity, the national compassion fund, in 2014, to ensure that donations made after tragedies go to victims. the group has raised about $5 million for orlando’s victims, ms. fernandez said, and will start to distribute the money in the next several weeks. kenneth feinberg, a lawyer who oversaw the federal government’s victim compensation fund and has become the administrator for a number of such accounts, said friday that he had consulted with officials in orlando but had not taken a formal role. mr. feinberg said he believed that people who donate money after tragedies intend it to go directly to victims. “there is the understanding that it is a special fund for a special tragedy requiring a special effort,” he said.",0,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.087500000000002,16.400000000000002,0.0,0.0
"new earthquake rocks italy, buildings collapse but no deaths reported","reuters a powerful earthquake struck italy on sunday in the same central regions that have been rocked by repeated tremors over the past two months, with more homes and churches brought down but no deaths reported. the quake, which measured 6.6 according to the u.s. geological survey, was bigger than one on aug. 24 that killed almost 300 people. many people have fled the area since then, helping to avoid a new devastating death toll. the latest quake was felt across much of italy, striking at 7.40 a.m. (0640 gmt), its epicenter close to the historic umbrian walled town of norcia, some 100 km (60 miles) from the university city of perugia. panicked norcia residents rushed into the streets and the town’s ancient basilica of st. benedict collapsed, leaving just the facade standing. nuns, monks and locals sank to their knees in the main square in silent prayer before the shattered church. “this is a tragedy. it is a coup de grace. the basilica is devastated,” bishop renato boccardo of norcia told reuters. “everyone has been suspended in a never-ending state of fear and stress. they are at their wits end,” said boccardo, referring to the thousands of tremors that have rattled the area since august, including two serious quakes on wednesday. italy’s civil protection unit, which coordinates disaster relief, said numerous houses were destroyed on sunday in the regions of umbria and marche, but either they were deserted at the time or most of the residents managed to escape beforehand. “no deaths have been reported, but there are a number of people injured,” said civil protection chief fabrizio curcio, adding that just one person was in a serious condition. prime minister matteo renzi said italy was living through extremely difficult times, but promised a massive reconstruction effort in the years ahead regardless of any possible objections from the european union over the eventual costs. “we will rebuild everything, the houses, the churches and the businesses,” renzi told reporters. “everything that needs to be done to rebuild these areas will be done.” local authorities said towns and villages already battered by august’s 6.2 quake had suffered further significant damage. “this morning’s quake has hit the few things that were left standing. we will have to start from scratch,” michele franchi, the deputy mayor of arquata del tronto, told rai television. experts said sunday’s quake was the strongest here since a 6.9 quake in italy’s south in 1980 that killed 2,735 people. artistic loss the destruction of the norcia basilica was the single most significant loss of italy’s artistic heritage in an earthquake since a tremor in 1997 caused the collapse of the ceiling of the basilica of st francis in assisi, which is 80 km to the north. the frescoed basilica, which is the spiritual, historic and tourist heart of norcia, was built over the site of the home where the founder of the benedictine order and his sister st. scolastica were born in 480. the basilica and monastery complex dates to the 13th century, although shrines to st. benedict and his sister had been built there since the 8th century. benedict founded the benedictine order in subiaco, near rome. he died in 530 in the monastery at monte cassino, south of rome, which was destroyed during world war two. that monastery was later rebuilt. a number of other churches were also ruined on sunday, italian media reported, including norcia’s cattedrale di santa maria, which was built in the 16th century, while the town hall belltower had deep cracks running through its walls. however, most of norcia’s homes appeared to have withstood the prolonged tremor, with residents praising years of investment by local authorities in anti-seismic protection. in the nearby city of rieti patients were evacuated from a hospital to allow experts to check on structural damage, while hillroads across the region were littered with fallen rocks. sunday’s earthquake was felt as far north as bolzano, near the border with austria and as far south as the puglia region at the southern tip of the italian peninsula. it was also felt strongly in the capital rome, where transport authorities shut down the metro system for precautionary checks. authorities also toured the city’s main roman catholic basilicas looking for possible damage. italy sits on two geological fault lines, making it one of the most seismically active countries in europe. gianluca valinsese, a scientist at italy’s national institute for geophysics and vulcanology, warned the latest series of quakes could continue for weeks in a domino effect along the central apennine fault system. italy’s deadliest quake since the start of the 20th century came in 1908, when a tremor followed by a tsunami killed an estimated 80,000 people in the southern regions of reggio calabria and sicily.

trump criticized for tweet on london mayor after bridge attacks,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump came under fire on sunday for criticizing london’s mayor in the aftermath of attacks in the city that killed seven people and injured at least 48 others. in a tweet, trump seized on comments by london mayor sadiq khan, who said britons should not be alarmed to see more police in the streets after three men drove a van into pedestrians on london bridge before stabbing others nearby. “at least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’” trump tweeted. “we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. if we don’t get smart it will only get worse,” trump said. in response, a spokesperson for the london mayor said khan “is busy working with the police, emergency services and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack.” “he has more important things to do than respond to donald trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police - including armed officers - on the streets,” the spokesperson said. former vice president al gore, speaking on cnn’s “state of the union” program, said he thought trump’s tweet misrepresented what the mayor had said. “i don’t think that a major terrorist attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticize a mayor who’s trying to organize his city’s response to this attack,” gore, a democrat, said. senator mark warner, a democrat and vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee, told cnn that it “troubles” him to see the kinds of tweets trump has put out in the aftermath of the london attacks. trump did not mention the mayor when speaking after a gala event at washington’s ford’s theatre later on sunday, where he condemned the attacks as an “evil slaughter.” he said the united states would do everything in its power to assist the uk in bringing those responsible to justice. “this bloodshed must end. this bloodshed will end,” trump said, adding he would “do what is necessary” to prevent the threat from reaching the united states. islamic state on sunday claimed responsibility for the london attack. trump also spoke with british prime minister theresa may to offer condolences and offered washington’s “full support,” the white house said in a statement. earlier in the day, trump cited the london attacks to push his march 6 executive order that would temporarily ban entry into the united states of people from six predominantly muslim countries. the ban has been blocked in the courts and trump’s legal team has asked the supreme court to reinstate it. trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect americans from terrorist attacks. critics say his reasoning is flawed and assail the ban as discriminatory. speaking on nbc’s “meet the press” program, former secretary of state john kerry said on sunday: “a travel ban will be cannon fodder to the recruiters. it’s the worst thing we could do.” republican senator susan collins told the cbs program “face the nation” that she thought trump’s travel ban was “not the right way to go” because it was too broad. the u.s. state department said it was monitoring the security situation and advised americans in britain to heed the advice of local authorities and maintain their security awareness. the u.s. department of homeland security issued a statement late on saturday saying: “at this time, we have no information to indicate a specific, credible terror threat in the united states.” law enforcement officials in major u.s. cities said they were not aware of any threats but were on alert.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.190000000000001,8.0,0.0,0.0
u.s. house democratic women seek probe of trump misconduct accusations,"washington (reuters) - more than 50 female democratic lawmakers in the u.s. house of representatives called on monday for a congressional investigation into allegations by various women of sexual misconduct against president donald trump, who has denied the accusations. “we cannot ignore the multitude of women who have come forward with accusations against mr. trump,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter, though a formal inquiry was unlikely to result because republicans control the agenda in congress. the letter, spearheaded by the democratic women’s working group, which is composed of all the party’s female members in the house, was signed by 56 lawmakers. it followed a call earlier on monday by three women who have accused trump of sexual misconduct for a congressional investigation into his behavior. the lawmakers’ request for a probe was sent to leaders of the oversight and government reform committee, the main investigative committee in the house. over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them in the years before he entered politics. monday’s letter from the democrats said there were at least 17 accusers and listed names. “the president’s own remarks appear to back up the allegations,” the letter said, saying trump had boasted “that he feels at liberty to perpetrate such conduct against women.” “the president should be allowed to present evidence in his own defense,” said the lawmakers. the letter was addressed to oversight panel chairman trey gowdy, a republican, and top democrat elijah cummings. trump last year apologized for talking about groping women in a 2005 tape recording that surfaced weeks before the presidential election, and said he had not done the things he talked about. more recently, trump has told allies that the voice on the recording was not his, the new york times reported recently. trump and white house officials have denied the sexual misconduct allegations against him, some of which date back to the 1980s. “these false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year’s campaign, and the american people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,” a white house spokesperson said in a statement on monday.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.73,16.0,0.0,0.0
"trump delegate indicted on weapons, child pornography charges","washington (reuters) - a maryland man who is a delegate for republican presidential candidate donald trump has been indicted for illegally shipping explosives, owning a machine gun and producing child pornography, the u.s. justice department said on thursday. caleb bailey, 30, was indicted by a grand jury in u.s. district court in greenbelt, maryland, on wednesday. he was elected to be a delegate for trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, and is still listed as one on the state’s board of elections website. joe cluster, executive director of the maryland republican party, confirmed bailey had been indicted and told reuters the party was asking bailey to resign from the delegation. “i don’t know too much about him beyond what i’ve read,” said cluster, who declined to comment further. bailey had hundreds of illegal weapons stored in a bunker beneath his garage, including dozens of machine guns, smokeless grenades and gas canisters, along with ready-to-eat meals, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. telephone calls and emails seeking comment from bailey, from the trump campaign and from the maryland board of elections were not returned on thursday. trump has been working to unify the republican party going into its presidential nominating convention in cleveland in july. in march, a new hampshire man who co-chaired trump’s veterans coalition in the state was extradited to nevada to face charges of helping organize the high-profile 2014 armed standoff with federal agents at the ranch of cliven bundy. the four-count indictment against bailey alleges that he used a minor to “engage in sexually explicit conduct to produce child pornography” and illegally owned a machine gun. authorities became aware of bailey after he tried to ship explosives and ammunition from maryland to wisconsin through the u.s. mail in february, said an affidavit filed by a special agent with the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives. some of the types of cartridges bailey was sending to wisconsin are no longer used by the u.s. military because they are too dangerous, the law enforcement official said, so shipping them was “not only illegal, but posed a significant public risk.” the wisconsin recipient is under investigation as well, according to the official. bailey attempted to ship five such packages in total, but one broke open at the post office, prompting the facility to call law enforcement, according to the affidavit.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.605000000000004,18.2,0.0,0.0

early reports are that nelson and allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. so a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. what an insult to the people of alabama.another problem with nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge, moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case.the moore campaign has been pressuring nelson and allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored.with nelson now thoroughly discredited, this leaves two accusers against moore.one is leigh corfman, who claims moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. she is the most credible of the three, but the narrative behind her story, that moore s abuse resulted in corfman s living a troubled life of drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt, is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records.moore s final accuser is tina johnson, a woman who claims moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. but, again, as was the case with corfman and nelson, the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the washington post, al.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context.thanks to new media s going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting, we now know that johnson did not tell the entire truth. she was not in moore s office on business. if she was in moore s office at all, it was due to a bitter custody battle where moore represented johnson s mother, who was trying to gain custody of johnson s 12-year-old son based on the claim that johnson was an unfit, absent, and unstable mother. if the media and the accusers and gloria allred told the full truth to begin with, they would all be more credible.here are close up versions of the signatures. note, that when viewed close up, the signature is signed in both black and blue ink.here is a closer version of the yearbook signature:here is wictor s explanation for the different colors of ink:(4) the light is reflecting off of the ink.the ink that looks blue is actually black. it's different ink than the original ink.therefore it reflects light differently. thomas wictor (@thomaswictor) november 16, 2017(11) so, to recap:the signature is a forgery, and everything after the name ""roy-ray"" was added later with different ink. pic.twitter.com/1spv6aabge thomas wictor (@thomaswictor) november 15, 2017just like the ""th"" doomed dan rather, ""da"" will doom the anti roy moore forces. they copied his signature on nelsons divorce order not realizing ""da"" was his assistants initials, not his title. the sheer stupidity! pic.twitter.com/owj5fzm6fr truthhurts (@tru768) november 15, 2017after the yearbook signature came into question, moore s attorney came out with a statement regarding the signature in the high school yearbook. here s what he had to say:roy moore's attorney: ""[nelson & gloria allred] said that ms. nelson after the allegations had never seen or had any contact with judge moore in 1999, ms. nelson filed a divorce action the judge assigned was roy s. moore."" pic.twitter.com/bv5zv0cmvc fox news (@foxnews) november 15, 2017",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.2755555555555596,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0

u.s. house panel to consider self-driving car legislation,"washington (reuters) - a u.s. house subcommittee will vote on wednesday on a sweeping proposal to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules. the measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to u.s. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. automakers would have to show self-driving cars “function as intended and contain fail safe features” but the transportation department could not “condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications,” the draft measure unveiled late monday said. last month, a u.s. house energy and commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a draft plan to allow u.s. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls and bar states from setting rules that could block their use. automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. the 30-page draft bill would also require the transportation department within two years to adopt rules requiring automakers to add a driver alert to check rear seating in an effort to prevent children from being left behind and consider setting performance standards for headlights. “this legislation puts important benchmarks into place that will prioritize consumer safety technologies and enhance mobility opportunities for people across the country,” said republican u.s. representative robert latta, who chairs the panel that will vote on the measure wednesday. democrats had sought a number of new safety requirements during negotiations over the measure. the bill also includes automakers to take steps to ensure the cybersecurity of self-driving cars. general motors co, alphabet inc, tesla inc and others have been lobbying congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in california and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal. the administration of former democratic president barack obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. president donald trump’s transportation secretary, elaine chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months. the issue has taken new urgency after u.s. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data shows. automakers also say that without changes in regulations, u.s. self-driving car testing could move to europe and elsewhere.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.130000000000003,18.2,0.0,0.0
"police violence escalates as provocateurs infiltrate standing rock, #nodapl protests","videos police violence escalates as provocateurs infiltrate standing rock, #nodapl protests while reporting from the dakota access pipeline protests, mintpress news reporter derrick broze witnessed the actions of destructive forces which have infiltrated the peaceful native-led movement and provoked increasingly violent responses from law enforcement. | november 6, 2016 be sociable, share! the remnants of a vehicle burned on north dakota highway 1806 on the night of oct. 27. non-peaceful forces embedded on the side of the water protectors were seen burning the vehicle and two armored vehicles over the protests of water protectors. (derrick broze for mintpress) standing rock sioux reservation, north dakota — police violence has escalated and destructive forces have entered the fray in recent weeks as “water protectors” in north dakota have continued their fight against the construction of the dakota access pipeline. on nov. 2, police targeted water protectors from the sacred stone, oceti sakowin, and red warrior camps with pepper spray and rubber bullets in response to their peaceful efforts to stop the destruction of the gravesites alma parkin and matilda galpin, indigenous women who once owned the nearby cannonball ranch. “water protectors building a makeshift bridge across the cannonball river were met by riot police firing less-than-lethal munitions at point blank range and indiscriminately blasting oc spray on peaceful unarmed people,” the camp of the sacred stones reported on nov. 3. the native communities who oppose the pipeline prefer to call themselves water protectors as a way to signify that their fight is one in defense of the health of the water in the pipeline’s path, specifically the missouri river. “the bridge was torn down per the orders received by morton county from the u.s. army corps of engineers . morton county police then unleashed pepper spray and tear gas on water protectors standing in the river with their hands in the air.” more than 100 people were injured in the violence which came just one day after president barack obama told now this news that he was monitoring the situation closely and exploring possible ways to “reroute” the pipeline. “we’re going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that i think is properly attentive to the traditions of first americans,” obama said. watch “president obama says they’re examining ways to ‘reroute’ the dakota access pipeline” from 2016 nowthis election: police and protesters turn violent the week preceding obama’s statement took a violent turn, as law enforcement raided camps and destructive forces positioned on the side of the water protectors made themselves known. militarized riot police raided two frontline camps on oct. 27, making 107 arrests as they deployed pepper spray, stun guns, and physical force in response to a crowd of unarmed water protectors who were blocking the path of pipeline construction. the water protectors attempted to keep police and pipeline workers from accessing the construction site by setting fires to barricades, but police were able to eventually remove everyone from the frontline camps and reclaim the land where the pipeline is slated to be built. water protectors face off with a police line off north dakota highway 1806. law enforcement wear riot gear as they prepare to remove the frontline camp. oct. 27, 2016 (derrick broze for mintpress) later that night, a bridge on north dakota highway 1806, just north of the red warrior and oceti sakowin camps in mandan, was the scene of another standoff between law enforcement and citizens opposed to the pipeline. although stationed on the water protectors’ side of the bridge, a small group of individuals did not seem to hold the same values or practice the same tactics as the larger, native-led movement against the pipeline. watch “water protectors face off with police #nodapl” from mintpress news: in stark contrast to the water protectors’ many actions of peaceful prayer and ceremony, the atmosphere at the bridge the night of oct. 27 was more reminiscent of an outdoor rave. the protesters on the bridge set fire to an suv, and threw rocks and other objects at a row of armored vehicles operated by law enforcement. this small faction of non-peaceful protesters and officers briefly tossed smoke bombs back and forth. officers eventually lit two smoke bombs on the north side of the bridge before parking two armored vehicles at the exit to the bridge, preventing water protectors and protestors from evacuating in that direction. all law enforcement vehicles were gone within a matter of minutes, and protesters climbed aboard the armored vehicles before setting fire to them. when several water protectors came to the bridge, they told those setting the fires and instigating violence that this isn’t what they want for the movement. “if you feel uncomfortable, if you don’t like this action, go back to camp,” one of the men shouted back at the water protectors. saying prayer had failed, the small group of non-peaceful protesters said they were now fighting “by any means necessary.” the fires they set burned throughout the night, as neither law enforcement nor fire department personnel ever arrived at the scene to extinguish the flames. gabriella scarlett, a water protector from canada, signals for peace as a fire barricade burns off county road 134. behind her, water protectors establish a fire barricade to hold police back from the site of construction of the dakota access pipeline. oct. 27, 2016 (derrick broze for mintpress) agitators make their presence known on oct. 28, water protectors and elders arrived on the scene to retake the bridge from the agitating faction in all-black clothing, a tactic for protests and marches known as “black bloc.” there were no more than 20 of these provocateurs, and they all traveled together in five older pick-up trucks. several fights broke out on the bridge as the agitators clashed with those calling strictly for prayer and ceremony, and the agitators were run off the bridge and back to the camps within an hour. siouxz, the head of security on the frontline camp off north dakota highway 1806, said those who started the fires were not with the water protector movement. “ seven council has came and they are very ashamed of the behavior of some of the non-traditional people here who can’t respect our ways and how we want to make this prayerful,” siouxz told mintpress news. “we’re here to protect the water, not initiate a riot or some violent protest, which is the image that the whole world is getting right now. our elders have come together to condemn all of these wrongful actions like catching things on fire.” apparently intent on forcing their tactics upon the movement, these outside forces appeared uninterested in listening to the standing rock sioux or other native water protectors. although the black bloc tactic has been used as a legitimate way for protesters to shield their identities from law enforcement, it has also been exploited by law enforcement. police masquerading as black bloc activists have been exposed at the 2001 g8 summit in genoa, italy , and at protests in 2007 in quebec , and police posed as activists to infiltrate the occupy movement. a water protector stares down police along county road 134, in mandan, north dakota, north of red warrior camp. law enforcement wear riot gear as they prepare to remove the frontline camp. oct. 27, 2016 (derrick broze for mintpress) “solidarity becomes the hijacking or destruction of competing movements, which is exactly what the black bloc contingents are attempting to do with the occupy movement,” chris hedges, a progressive independent journalist and activist, wrote in a scathing criticism of the black bloc’s presence during the occupy movement. law enforcement isn’t the only institution going undercover to infiltrate activist groups. corporate entities also have a history of attempting to spy on peaceful, law-abiding activists . a 2013 report by the center for corporate policy found that a large number of corporations are hiring former law enforcement, cia, nsa, fbi, and military employees to act as spies. in the report, titled “ spooky business ,” gary ruskin wrote: “many of the world’s largest corporations and their trade associations — including the u.s. chamber of commerce, walmart, monsanto, bank of america, dow chemical, kraft, coca-cola, chevron, burger king, mcdonald’s, shell, bp, bae, sasol, brown & williamson and e.on — have been linked to espionage or planned espionage against nonprofit organizations, activists and whistleblowers.” considering what is known about corporate agitation, it is possible that the provocateurs were hired by energy transfer partners , the company behind the pipeline, the banks financing the pipeline, or, really, any company that benefits from the pipeline in any way. ultimately, though, whether the agitators were police, corporate lackeys, or activists practicing a failed strategy, their actions do not represent the whole of the water protector movement and should not be used to discredit or delegitimize it. be sociable, share!",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.09,20.0,0.0,0.0
nyt admits key al qaeda role in aleppo,"editor's choice | 08.11.2016 nyt admits key al qaeda role in aleppo investigative reporter robert parry broke many of the iran-contra stories for the associated press and newsweek in the 1980s as much as the new york times and the mainstream u.s. media have become propaganda outlets on most foreign policy issues, like the one-sided coverage of the bloody syrian war, sometimes the truth seeps through in on-the-ground reporting by correspondents, even ones who usually are pushing the “propo.” such was the case with anne barnard’s new reporting from inside west aleppo, the major portion of the city which is in government hands and copes with regular terror rocket and mortar attacks from rebel-held east aleppo where al qaeda militants and u.s.-armed-and-funded “moderate” rebels fight side-by-side. samantha power, permanent representative of the united states to the un, addresses the security council meeting on syria, sept. 25, 2016. power has been an advocate for escalating u.s. military involvement in syria. (un photo) almost in passing, barnard’s article on sunday acknowledged the rarely admitted reality of the al qaeda/”moderate” rebel collaboration, which puts the united states into a de facto alliance with al qaeda terrorists and their jihadist allies, fighting under banners such as nusra front (recently renamed syria conquest front) and ahrar al-sham. barnard also finally puts the blame for preventing civilians in east aleppo from escaping the fighting on a rebel policy of keeping them in harm’s way rather than letting them transit through “humanitarian corridors” to safety. some of her earlier pro-rebel accounts suggested that it wasn’t clear who was stopping movement of civilians through those corridors. however, on sunday, she reported: “we had arrived at a critical moment, as russia said there was only one day left to pass through a corridor it had provided for people to escape eastern aleppo before the rebel side was flattened, a corridor through which precious few had passed. the government says rebels are preventing civilians from leaving. rebels refuse any evacuation without international supervision and a broader deal to deliver humanitarian aid.” granted, you still have to read between the lines, but at least there is the acknowledgement that rebels are refusing civilian evacuations under the current conditions. how that is different from islamic state terrorists in mosul, iraq, preventing departures from their areas – a practice which the times and other u.s. outlets condemn as using women and children as “human shields”– isn’t addressed. but barnard’s crimped admission is at least a start. barnard then writes: “instead [of allowing civilians to move through the humanitarian corridors], they [the rebels] are trying to break the siege, with qaeda-linked groups and those backed by the united states working together — the opposite of what russia has demanded.” again, that isn’t the clearest description of the situation, which is stunning enough that one might have expected it in the lede rather than buried deep inside the story, but it is significant that the times is recognizing that al qaeda and the u.s.-backed “moderates” are “working together” and that russia opposes that collaboration. she also noted that “three qaeda-linked suicide bombers attacked a military position with explosive-packed personnel carriers on thursday, military officials said, and mortar fire was raining on neighborhoods that until now had been relatively safe. it was among the most intense rounds in four years of rebel shelling that officials say has killed 11,000 civilians.” while she then throws in a caveat about the impossibility of verifying the numbers, the acknowledgement that the u.s.-backed “moderate” rebels and their al qaeda comrades have been shelling civilians in west aleppo is significant, too. before this, all the american people heard was the other side, from rebel-held east aleppo, about the human suffering there, often conveyed by “activists” with video cameras who have depicted the conflict as simply the willful killing of children by the evil syrian government and the even more evil russians. more balance with the admission of rebel terror attacks on civilians in west aleppo, the picture finally is put into more balance. the al qaeda and u.s.-backed rebels have been killing thousands of civilians in government-controlled areas and the syrian military and its russian allies have struck back only to be condemned for committing “war crimes.” the second plane about to crash into the world trade center towers in new york city on sept. 11, 2001 though the human toll in both sides of aleppo is tragic, we have seen comparable situations before – in which the u.s. government has supported, supplied and encouraged governments to mount fierce offensives to silence rockets or mortars fired by rebels toward civilian areas. for instance, senior u.s. government officials, including president barack obama and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, have defended israel’s right to defend itself from rockets fired from inside gaza even though those missiles rarely kill anyone. yet, israel is allowed to bomb the near-defenseless people of gaza at will, killing thousands including the four little boys blown apart in july 2014 while playing on a beach during the last round of what the israelis call “mowing the grass.” in the context of those deaths, u.s. ambassador to the united nations samantha power, who has built her career as a supposed humanitarian advocating a “responsibility to protect” civilians, laid the blame not on the israeli military but on fighters in gaza who had fired rockets that rarely hit anything besides sand. at the united nations on july 18, 2014, power said , “president obama spoke with [israeli] prime minister netanyahu this morning to reaffirm the united states’ strong support for israel’s right to defend itself…. hamas’ attacks are unacceptable and would be unacceptable to any member state of the united nations. israel has the right to defend its citizens and prevent these attacks.” but that universal right apparently does not extend to syria where u.s.-supplied rockets are fired into civilian neighborhoods of west aleppo. in that case, power and other u.s. officials apply an entirely different set of standards. any syrian or russian destruction of east aleppo with the goal of suppressing that rocket fire becomes a “war crime.” perhaps it’s expected that the u.s. government, like other governments, will engage in hypocrisy regarding affairs of state: one set of rules for u.s. allies and another for countries marked for u.s. “regime change.” statements by supposed “humanitarians”– such as samantha power, “ms. r2p”– are no exception. but double standards are even more distasteful when they come from allegedly “objective” journalists such as those who work at the new york times, the washington post and other prestige american news outlets. when they take the “u.s. side” in a dispute and become crude propagandists, they encourage the kind of misguided “group thinks” that led to the criminal iraq war and other disastrous “regime change” projects over the past two decades. yet, that is what we normally see. a thoughtful reader can’t peruse the international reporting of the u.s. mainstream media without realizing that it is corrupted by propaganda from both government officials and from u.s.-funded operations, often disguised as “human rights activists” or “citizen journalists” whose supposed independence makes their “propo” even more effective. so, it’s worth noting those rare occasions when the new york times and the rest of the msm let some of the reality peek through. when evaluating the latest plans from hillary clinton and other interventionists to expand the u.s. military intervention in syria – via prettily named “safe zones” and “no-fly zones”– the american people should realize that they are being asked to come to the aid of al qaeda.",1,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.7550000000000026,3.2,0.0,0.0
euro zone enlargement call sparks backlash in germany,"tallinn (reuters) - after years of bailing out greece, the idea of letting more poorer states into the euro zone has sparked controversy, particularly in germany, where chancellor angela merkel is seeking re-election in two weeks time. the backlash came after european commission president jean-claude juncker called on wednesday for non-euro zone countries to quickly adopt the single currency so that the european union can find new unity in the euro after britain leaves in 2019. juncker promised to propose technical and financial help for the willing, quickly triggering concern from influential german members of the european parliament, like the deputy chairman of the economic committee markus ferber. juncker s call was interpreted by some in germany as meaning the commission would be lenient in assessing the readiness for the single currency of the mostly former communist and poorer eastern european countries like bulgaria or romania. greece, which adopted the euro in 2001, later turned out not to have been ready because of falsified deficit statistics. the country triggered a massive debt crisis in the euro zone and had to be bailed out three times by other euro zone governments. euro for all eu countries? there are clear criteria and rules for joining. greece can not repeat itself, ferber tweeted after the juncker speech. eu officials became concerned that the misreading of the juncker speech in germany could fuel support for populist and eurosceptic parties and juncker aides took to twitter on friday to try and counter that effect. they stressed that countries would only be allowed into the single currency if they met economic and governance criteria. in german language-only tweets they also pointed out that some, like keen would-be member bulgaria, already meet many, though not all, of the economic standards for entry. to adopt the euro, a european union country has to have low inflation, interest rates and debt, a deficit within the eu limits, as well as a stable exchange rate, proven by two years spent in the exchange rate mechanism ii without severe tensions. the exchange rate of the bulgarian lev is absolutely stable to the euro since 2006, juncker s head of cabinet martin selmayr tweeted. the inflation rate of bulgaria is just at 0.2 pct and much lower than in the euro area. addressing german sensitivity to debt, he tweeted: german debt is almost 66 pct of gdp, more than twice as high as the bulgarian one. romania and bulgaria meet all the nominal criteria to join the euro except the two-year exchange rate stability test in the erm ii and the compatibility of their central bank laws with euro zone requirements. they are also far from meeting the soft criterion of real economic convergence with euro zone economies a factor that could prevent them getting the go-ahead for adopting the euro. countries outside the euro zone include bulgaria, croatia, czech republic, hungary, poland, romania, sweden, denmark and britain, but the last two have a formal opt-out from joining. others have a legal obligation to adopt the euro when they meet all the criteria, but there are no deadlines for that. commission vice president valdis dombrovskis said bulgaria had expressed to him a clear desire to join the euro zone. romania has expressed a similar sentiment. but some of the biggest and more wealthy non-euro members of the eu like sweden, poland or the czech republic and hungary have no plans to adopt the currency in the foreseeable future, preferring to keep the economic flexibility provided by control over their own exchange rate.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.180000000000003,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
merkel sees no military solution to u.s. dispute with north korea,"berlin (reuters) - there is no military solution to the united states’ dispute with north korea, german chancellor angela merkel said on friday, adding that a war of words between the two countries was the wrong approach. “i don’t see a military solution to this conflict,” merkel told reporters in berlin. “i see the need for enduring work at the u.n. security council ... as well as tight cooperation between the countries involved, especially the u.s. and china”. “germany will be intensively involved in any non-military solutions,” merkel said. “but an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer.”",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009545454545457,13.10909090909091,0.0,0.0

watch: congressman invokes impeachment power on house floor in response to trump’s muslim ban,"donald trump s executive order barring people from entering the united states from seven countries in the middle east exposed his violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution.and a house democrat took him to task for it on thursday during a speech on the house floor.when trump signed the executive order last friday, he targeted people traveling for nations that are not responsible for any deaths of american citizens on american soil, despite claiming that his order is meant to protect americans from terrorists.trump even invoked 9/11 to justify the order, but left countries off the list where many of the hijackers came from, such as saudi arabia, which also helped fund them and their operation.the nations trump conveniently left off the list also have something else in common. they all have business ties with the trump organization.in other words, trump is a complete hypocrite and is making foreign policy decisions based on whether they will hurt his family s business or not.and wisconsin rep. mark pocan absolutely hammered trump for it on the house floor with a devastating speech. these countries were excluded from the executive order despite being home to many of the terrorists who carried out 9/11, pocan pointed out. i m not saying we should ban people from these countries. i firmly oppose any ban based on nationality or religion. but it is unacceptable that business interests have played potentially a role in such a destructive policy, a policy that also makes our country less safe in the long run. pocan explained that trump s business interests in the countries left off the list influenced his decision to not include them even though trump repeatedly declared that he would make america safe by blocking nations where terrorists come from to attack us. trump clearly believes that maintaining his business interests are more important than banning travel from saudi arabia, the country where most of the 9/11 attackers were from and received their funding. it s time for the president to stop defending his divisive and unconstitutional executive order and start being transparent about his business interests, pocan said. every president in the modern era has released tax records to ensure the american people that their actions will not be impacted by financial holdings. indeed, richard nixon was the first president to release his tax records to the public, and that set a precedent that all presidential candidates have followed over the decades. trump broke that precedent and refused to release his taxes because he is hiding his numerous business connections with nations like russia that would expose him and his treachery to the american people. trump now says he won t release his taxes at all despite promising that he would do so after an audit is completed, even though an audit does not prevent someone from releasing their tax records.pocan then demanded that trump release his taxes, divest himself from his company, and repeal his executive order or else face legislative action, including the possibility of impeachment. mr. president, it s time for you to fix this. one, divest your business holding immediately to remove any suggestion of conflicts in your decision making. two, show us your tax returns so financial interests are transparent to the american people. and three, get rid of your unconstitutional executive order, which will make us less safe and only serve to embolden our enemies. short of that, we ll have to take other actions, including legislative directives, resolutions of disapproval and even explore the power of impeachment. the speaker then whined about pocan threatening impeachment as if republicans hadn t been calling for impeaching president obama over the last eight years.here s the video via youtube.donald trump is a liar and a traitor who is putting his business interests ahead of the best interests of the american people. not only should he be impeached, his entire administration should be removed. and democrats could get the chance to do exactly that if americans vote in 2018 to take the house away from the republican majority.featured image via alex wong/getty images",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.412857142857145,11.314285714285715,0.0,0.0
"six latin king gangsters charged in street stabbing, beating of crippled man","prosecutors charged six members of the violent latin kings street gang with stabbing and beating a handicapped man. the gang members allegedly punched, repeatedly stabbed, and beat the victim with his own cane. [district attorney richard a. brown said that the defendants are each accused of brutally attacking a young man for no reason other than he was not a part of the latin kings. “gang violence will not be tolerated in queens county,” brown said. “the defendants’ poor choice in pursuing gang membership and the violence that are a part of that lifestyle have led them to be charged with serious felonies that carry the possibility of lengthy prison sentences. ” a queens county grand jury indicted six members of the violent latin kings street gang. they are charged with attempted murder and gang assault stemming from an october 2016 attack on a man, according to a statement from queens county district attorney. the six defendants — michael aragundi, jonathan duy, jordan leon, wilson matute, luis mayancela, and luis minchala — were each charged with one count of attempted murder, one count of gang assault, one count of assault, two counts of robbery, one count of robbery and one count of assault. brown said that the six latin kings members approached the outside a bar during the early morning hours of october 29, 2016, and began attacking him — allegedly punching him and stabbing him. the latin kings used a cane that the victim had with him as a weapon against him. they proceeded to beat him mercilessly with it, prosecutors stated. following the attack, the six gang members fled the scene. emergency responders transported the victim to a nearby hospital where he received treatment for multiple stab wounds and lacerations to his head and neck. brown said that the victim suffered nerve damage to his left arm which has left him with numbness in his arm and hand. the judge in the case ordered the six defendants back to court on july 10, 2017. the gang members each face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. ryan saavedra is a contributor for breitbart texas and can be found on twitter at @realsaavedra.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.806666666666668,4.800000000000001,0.0,0.0

irish postage stamp homage to che guevara stokes criticism,"dublin (reuters) - the unlikely choice of argentinian communist guerrilla leader ernesto che guevara, hero of the cuban revolution, as the face of the new 1-euro postage stamp in ireland is stoking controversy on both sides of the atlantic. the traditionally catholic country, which has never had a left-wing government, only established diplomatic relations with cuba in 1999, 40 years after guevara helped lead the cuban revolution with fidel castro. however guevara s father, ernesto guevara lynch, was a civil engineer of irish descent and the iconic red and black print of the long-haired che known from t-shirts and posters around the world was produced by an irish artist, jim fitzpatrick. on this basis ireland s postal service this week issued the new stamp featuring fitzpatrick s image of guevara to mark the 50th anniversary of his death. the postal service described guevara, killed by cia-backed bolivian soldiers in bolivia in 1967, as the quintessential left-wing revolutionary. it said demand for the stamp has rivaled that of its two previously most popular releases, commemorating the sinking of the titanic and ireland s 1916 rising against british rule. but it was quickly reminded that guevara remains for many symbol of the violent abuses of cuba s communist government, with one irish senator describing guevara as a barbaric interrogator, jailer and executioner of hundreds of supposed class enemies . it is my belief that he is most definitely not a suitable candidate for such an honor, said neale richmond, a member of irish governing party fine gael in a letter to ireland s communications minister. cuban-american radio host ninoska perez castellon joined the fray urging listeners to write to the postal service to ask for the stamp to be scrapped. fitzpatrick, whose 1968 print based on a picture taken by cuban photographer alberto korda was adopted by left-wing students on t-shirts and posters, turning it into a global sign of rebellion, said he was not surprised by the response. irish anti-communists threatened to throw a brick through a local shop window when it displayed the image when he first produced it half a century ago. it s not totally unexpected. it was a revolution and you have two parties of opposites and we had the same after the civil war in this country, fitzpatrick told reuters at his dublin home, where the front room doubles as a studio with old drawings and sketches scattered about the desk. i thought it was amazing that they (the postal service) wanted to do a stamp of che and it was a great honor for me, he said. fitzpatrick, who has designed album covers for irish rock star sinead o connor and the band thin lizzy, said in 2011 that he was seeking to obtain the copyright to his image of che, to prevent crass, commercial use of it. a spokesman for the postal service said neither fitzpatrick nor the estate of the photographer korda was being paid for the use of the image on the stamp.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0
ex-u.s. attorney bharara signs book deal after firing by trump,"(reuters) - former manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara, who earned a reputation for fighting crime on wall street and public corruption before president donald trump fired him in march, has signed a book deal with alfred a. knopf. the book, as yet untitled, is about “the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general,” knopf said in a statement on thursday. publication is expected in january 2019. bharara said his book would be about the law, “integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning.” “it addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice,” bharara said in a statement. in 2009, president barack obama appointed bharara to serve as u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york, which includes manhattan. during seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects. “preet bharara’s life experience, coupled with his standing as a u.s. attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book,” said sonny mehta, editor-in-chief for knopf, which is a division of penguin random house. bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at new york university’s law school, was unexpectedly fired by trump on march 11 after refusing to step down. he had been among 46 u.s. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. in november, bharara met with trump at trump tower in new york city, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a “good meeting” and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor.” he was fired a few months later. this month, bharara told abc news in an interview that he received “unusual” phone calls from trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. he said he was fired after declining to take the third call. bharara said he believed trump’s calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. knopf spokesman paul bogaards said on thursday that bharara “addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal.” whether the book itself goes into the details of bharara’s firing “remains an open question,” bogaards said.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.830000000000002,8.0,0.0,0.0
#resist as marketing: ’fearless girl’ statue taking home awards at cannes - breitbart,"the “fearless girl” statue which stands opposite of the iconic charging bull on wall street is racking up awards this week at cannes lions, the largest annual gathering of marketing executives. [the statue was commissioned on behalf of asset manager state street and advertising agency mccann new york as a way of encouraging firms to hire more female executives. “its simplicity in the use of symbolism transcends geography, it transcends language, it transcends culture,” wendy clark, ceo of ddb north america, told adweek. “for us, while it is a girl, it elegantly captures women’s journeys and our path to empowerment. and it also encapsulates our hopes and our ambitions for every little girl in the world. ” clark also serves as the jury president of the cannes lions awards week, which was inspired by the cannes film festival and takes place at the same conference center in cannes, france. the “fearless girl” statue took home the grand prix in the glass, pr and outdoor lions categories on the festival’s first day. the statue was sculpted by artist kristen visbal in an effort to encourage gender diversity amongst corporate executives. “the girl is standing there like this in front the bull, saying, ‘now, what are you going to do?’ arturo di modica said, who sculpted the charging bull statue. di modica argues that the “fearless girl” statue violates his artistic rights as it changes the meaning of the bull statue. “remove her and place her somewhere else in the city,” di modica’s attorney said. “we’ve got lots of ideas. and damages must be awarded to arturo for violation of his legal, statutory rights. ” tom ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for breitbart news. you can follow him on twitter @tciccotta or email him at tciccotta@breitbart. com",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.740000000000002,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0
how trump overshadowed clinton's bad weekend,"(cnn) in any normal presidential election, it would be hard to overshadow news that the fbi interviewed one of the candidates for three and a half hours about potential criminal behavior. but in 2016, donald trump seems to be able to seize any news cycle -- intentionally or otherwise. his saturday tweet of a graphic that included hillary clinton's face, a six-pointed star, a pile of cash and the words ""most corrupt candidate ever"" drew immediate backlash for evoking anti-semitic imagery. the image was posted 10 days earlier to an anti-semitic, white supremacist message board. the graphic @realdonaldtrump tweeted yesterday was first posted on an anti-semitic forum: https://t.co/nlsh0ocvdv pic.twitter.com/rfeb7bkgfm trump on monday morning initially addressed the controversy -- again on twitter -- by blaming the ""dishonest media"" for ""trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star, or plain star!"" dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star, or plain star! on monday afternoon, the trump campaign finally issued a statement on the matter -- one that amounted more to a response to the clinton campaign statement than an explanation of his tweet. trump rejected the clinton campaign's accusations that his tweet was anti-semitic by slamming ""false attacks"" and insisting the star represented a sheriff's badge. ""these false attacks by hillary clinton trying to link the star of david with a basic star, often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior, showing an inscription that says 'crooked hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever' with anti-semitism is ridiculous,"" trump said in a statement. trump's statement did not address the fact that the campaign tweeted an image that had previously been posted on an anti-semitic, white supremacist message board. his statement also didn't explain where the campaign obtained the image. on monday night the trump campaign's social media director, daniel scavino, filled in some details on what he said were the image's origins. ""the social media graphic used this weekend was not created by the campaign nor was it sourced from an anti-semitic site,"" scavino said in a statement separate from trump's. ""it was lifted from an anti-hillary twitter user where countless images appear."" ""the sheriff's badge -- which is available under microsoft's 'shapes' -- fit with the theme of corrupt hillary and that is why i selected it,"" scavino added. scavino also said that as the campaign's social media director, ""i would never offend anyone and therefore chose to remove the image."" trump's stumbles were suddenly back in the spotlight on a weekend that would have otherwise focused on clinton's vulnerabilities. trump's prolific twitter habit is once again forcing republicans to confront questions about the temperament of the man they will soon formally nominate as their presidential candidate and his apparent unwillingness to forcefully reject the support of those with racist or anti-semitic views. it also comes as trump tries to manage a more disciplined campaign, underscoring fears among some in the gop that the businessman is unable to avoid self-inflicted wounds. adding to the fire is the trump campaign's refusal to answer questions about the tweet, its origin or whether anyone would be held accountable. it simply deleted the tweet and replaced the six-pointed star with a circle. the clinton campaign blasted trump's tweet monday as part of a broader pattern. ""donald trump's use of a blatantly anti-semitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that it's part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern,"" sarah bard, hillary for america's director of jewish outreach, said in a statement. ""now, not only won't he apologize for it, he's peddling lies and blaming others. trump should be condemning hate, not offering more campaign behavior and rhetoric that engages extremists."" it's not the first time trump's own controversies have overshadowed clinton's as a result of the presumptive republican nominee's unforced errors. two days before trump created a weeks-long news cycle by accusing a judge of being biased because of his mexican heritage, clinton faced one of the most damaging news items of her candidacy when the state department's inspector general released a scathing assessment of clinton's private email use. but trump's tirade on the judge, his doubling down on those race-based accusations and the ensuing rift it provoked between trump and newly-supportive republican leaders eclipsed clinton's email woes. shielded by the holiday weekend, top republicans in the house and senate were quiet on trump's latest controversy. but the campaign's refusal to show any sense of accountability when it comes to the tweet may only add to the storm. the first prominent trump surrogate to address the controversy was not a campaign spokesperson or trump himself, but was instead trump's recently-ousted campaign manager corey lewandowski who blamed ""political correctness run amok"" for the outcry during a sunday interview on cnn's ""state of the union."" ""there's no anti-semitism in mr. trump's body, not one ounce, not one cell,"" he told cnn's alisyn camerota, adding later, ""not every six-sided star is a star of david."" trump on sunday, meanwhile, refused to address the controversy over his tweet and sought to refocus scrutiny onto clinton. he slammed a ""totally rigged"" system that likely will not bring criminal charges against clinton and criticized former president bill clinton's private meeting with the u.s. attorney general loretta lynch just days earlier. he then tweeted condolences on the passing of holocaust survivor and nobel peace prize laureate elie wiesel. but still no word about his use of an image circulating in anti-semitic circles. trump's tweet monday addressing the graphic may only serve to further extend the controversy, drawing attention away from both clinton's email scandal and a news cycle this week that was expected to focus on trump's imminent decision to pick a running mate before the gop convention. trump's latest trouble is especially loaded because it's not the first instance of him tweeting or retweeting something linked to white supremacists. trump has previously retweeted neo-nazi accounts including one named ""@whitegenocidetm."" in november, he retweeted a graphic of false and racist crime statistics overstating the numbers of blacks killed by other blacks. and amid a groundswell of support from white supremacists, trump and his campaign have been slow and even loathe to reject the support of those individuals. when pressed by cnn's jake tapper earlier this year on the support of former ku klux klan leader david duke, who continues to peddle in anti-semitic conspiracy theories, trump initially said falsely he did not know of duke and would not disavow his support. he would later do so and blame a faulty earpiece. and when he was later confronted by cnn's wolf blitzer about anti-semitic death threats some of his supporters were directing at a jewish reporter who wrote a profile about trump's wife, the presumptive republican nominee refused to condemn those actions. ""i don't have a message to the fans,"" trump said when pressed on the anti-semitic death threats in an interview with blitzer in may. ""a woman wrote an article that's inaccurate."" now, questions continue to swirl around how his campaign obtained and decided to tweet a graphic that had circulated on a message board filled with anti-semitic conspiracy theories and neo-nazi message boards -- and whether he will repudiate the support of individuals who prescribe to that ideology.",0,6,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.383333333333333,9.066666666666668,0.16666666666666666,0.0
"ky gov. matt bevin slashes funding for ethics investigations, elections oversight","kentucky governor matt bevin recently introduced a budget proposal that will virtually eliminate the agency designed to investigate corruption in his own office.bevin s budget includes deep cuts to the state s executive branch ethics commission. the agency, which was created in the 1990 s, was formed in response to an fbi investigation which led to the indictments of almost two-dozen members of the state legislature.according to katie gabhart, the executive director of the executive branch ethics commission, the budget cuts will essentially hamstring the agency. we will be an investigative and auditing agency with no investigator and auditor, gabhart told state lawmakers, who are deliberating on the budget proposal this week . public servants are going to violate the ethics code and if they know we have an ethics commission with so few resources that we can t enforce the code, then what is the point of having one? also included in the proposed budget cuts is funding for the state s registry of election finance.as the name of the agency implies, the office is charged with monitoring political campaigns and enforcing campaign finance laws in kentucky.john steffen, executive director of the registry of election finance, told lawmakers that the governor s proposed budget cuts would leave the office without the ability to hire an auditor.state lawmakers responded by suggesting that the law could be changed so that some candidates would not be required to file campaign disclosures.in response, steffen said i don t know what statutory obligations can be changed and not render our entire agency meaningless. bevin was elected governor of kentucky in november of 2015, amid accusations of election rigging. bevin holds the distinction of being one of only three non-democratic governors to hold office in kentucky since wwii.prior to assuming the position of governor, bevin was best known for delivering a political speech at a cockfighting rally in 2014, before losing an embarrassing senate race to mitch mcconnell.he later gained national attention when he praised kentucky clerk kim davis, after she refused to provide marriage licenses to lgbt couples.it should come as no surprise that bevin s budget seeks to slash the very agency which was created to investigate ethics violations committed in his own office.we saw the same thing from former texas governor rick perry, another politicians with close ties to the koch-backed tea party, in 2013.nor should it be any surprise that the budget would virtually eliminate campaign finance oversight.the cuts are clearly designed to give corrupt tea party politicians like himself free reign in the state, without fear of political or legal repercussions.image credit: gage skidmore, via flckr",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.372727272727271,15.30909090909091,0.0,0.0
"after kansas shootings, indians are wary of coming to u.s. - the new york times","new delhi — jeena sharma, 25, was applying for a work visa to the united states when news came that two indian engineers had been shot in a kansas bar by a man who drunkenly questioned their immigration status. news of the shootings, which took place last wednesday, was quickly eclipsed by other developments in washington, and even in kansas, but the same cannot be said of the sharma household of mumbai, where ms. sharma has received emphatic maternal lectures about her plans to move, starting first thing in the morning. “she asked me: ‘why do you even need to go to the states? why do you need to go to a country that doesn’t want you? i’m going to be scared for your life every day,’” ms. sharma said. even as she endeavored, patiently, to convey to her mother the difference between kansas and new york city, where she hopes to move, ms. sharma felt her own apprehensions growing, as the days passed and president trump made no statement on the crime. “it’s definitely very scary for me at the moment,” she said. “it’s almost as if a brown person is dead, like it doesn’t matter. ” the body of srinivas kuchibhotla, the software engineer fatally shot in the olathe, kan. bar, was expected to arrive by monday in hyderabad, a technology hub where immigration to the united states has long been viewed as the surest path to success. indians were relatively welcoming of mr. trump’s victory, and many here express admiration for his business empire and promised crackdown on terrorism. but even before wednesday’s shootings, that optimism had been diluted by fears that america might no longer welcome immigrants. india is second only to china as a feeder to american colleges, with around 165, 000 students enrolled in the school year, according to the institute of international education. indians are the largest recipients of temporary skilled worker visas, known as visas, which the trump administration intends to cut back. and close to half a million indians, who mostly went to the united states legally as students or tourists or on work visas, have stayed on after their visas expired, the pew research center estimates. reports of rising american hostility toward immigrants have stunned many indians, said alyssa ayres, a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations, who visited hyderabad recently. “i had a guy on a plane sitting next to me, who turned to me and said, ‘is it true, what they say about america under trump? ’” she said. “there is a kind of confusion: what is happening to the united states? people can’t believe what they’re reading. ” ill treatment of indian immigrants has, in the past, caused serious damage to bilateral relationships. in 2009 and 2010, reports of racially motivated crimes against indian students in australia set off demonstrations outside the australian embassy in new delhi, where australia’s prime minister was burned in effigy. after that, the number of indians applying for student visas plunged by nearly half, with severe costs to australian educational institutions. the diplomatic effect of the shootings in kansas has been muted so far. prime minister narendra modi has not commented on them, though the subject will certainly be raised this week, along with the thorny issue of curtailing visas, when foreign secretary subrahmanyam jaishankar visits washington. some indians who had planned to go to the united states said they were hesitating. manavi das, who is considering several universities, said she was “constantly looking to see if the school is in a red state, or has witnessed a shooting in recent times. “after a certain event in november,” she said, “i have found my apprehensions turned up a notch. ” sunny choudhary, 23, said he had decided not to apply to graduate engineering programs in the united states, because “recent conditions, they are turning into, i think, hostile conditions. ” after mr. trump was elected, he added, “my parents said: ‘no, you should not go there. now we won’t let you go there.’ ” he said that, like many of his friends, he had narrowed his search to europe. and some indian parents could use their persuasive talents to encourage their children to return home. “for this period, after the transfer of regimes, i think indians can come back and serve their country,” said suguna kadiyala, 73, whose daughter has been in the united states for 20 years. nageswara rao, 71, whose son and daughter work in the software sector in the united states, said he was “not much worried,” though he does dispense regular advice on safety measures. “it is always better to keep away from bars,” he said. his children are safe, he added, “because they don’t go to these bars where white people are more. ” he continued, “i give them advice to be a little bit careful and don’t get into a wrangle with anybody. just have your own peaceful life. ”",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.840000000000003,5.6571428571428575,0.0,0.0

sanders has gotten nastier. does it help explain his staying power?,"when bernie san­ders launched his long-shot bid for the presidency 10 months ago, there were two words that rarely crossed his lips: hillary clinton. now he can’t seem to stop talking about her — and not much of what he has to say is very nice. during a boisterous rally here, the senator from vermont dinged clinton for supporting a series of “disastrous” trade deals. he mocked her for refusing to release transcripts of paid speeches she gave to wall street firms. he said she was wrong to vote for the iraq war in 2002. the transformation has been stark. what’s less clear is whether sanders’s rhetoric helps explain his lasting power in a nominating contest that appears likely to drag on for weeks, considering the mounting number of victories he has scored in key states. so far, the evidence is mixed. in michigan last week, sanders won a surprising though narrow victory after closing a gap of more than 20 percentage points in the polls. he was relentless in the days before the election in criticizing clinton on trade. but sanders also got trounced the same day in mississippi — albeit a state where he didn’t mount much of a campaign. tuesday — a day when five states hold primaries — should give a better indication of whether sanders’s tough talk is paying off. one of those contests is in illinois, and sanders isn’t holding back as he campaigns here. in chicago on friday, sanders even took aim at clinton for her close association with mayor rahm emanuel (d), whose approval ratings are in the tank, particularly among black chicagoans. “i want to thank rahm emanuel for not endorsing me. i don’t want his endorsement!” sanders screamed, to the delight of a crowd estimated at 9,000 people. “i don’t want the endorsement of a mayor who is shutting down school after school and firing teachers.” to drive home his point, san­ders held a news conference the next day devoted entirely to emanuel. he told reporters that if he were clinton, he would have refused the mayor’s support. compared with the republican presidential race and other elections in past years, the democratic contest remains relatively tame. but the bernie sanders who is fighting to remain relevant in the delegate chase against clinton sounds quite different from the sanders whose chief antagonist was the “billionaire class” when he debuted on the campaign trail last spring. analysts say sanders’s decision to attack clinton more aggressively is understandable: it’s what candidates who are behind tend to do. but in sanders’s case, he risks damaging his brand as an anti-establishment politician who has boasted about never running negative television ads and pledged to stay positive in his bid for the democratic nomination. “when you’re promising to run a different kind of campaign, it’s never good to look like you’re running the same kind of campaign that other politicians do,” said mo elleithee, executive director of the institute of politics and public service at georgetown university. “it’s a risk, but it’s a calculated risk, and one they seem willing to take.” in an interview, sanders acknowledged that he’s adopted a tougher tone but said he has tried to stick to the issues and not engage in character attacks. to the extent that the race has turned more negative, sanders said, clinton is to blame. “we’re responding,” sanders said. “i find it disappointing when the secretary mischaracterizes my record.” sanders was particularly galled, he said, by clinton’s assertion during their recent debate in flint, mich., that he had opposed releasing funds to bail out the automobile industry — an issue of keen interest to voters in michigan, given detroit’s long history as the capital of the auto industry. most fact checkers who looked into clinton’s statement concluded she wasn’t telling the whole story. in 2008, sanders voted for an unsuccessful stand-alone bill to provide aid to the auto industry. the bill clinton referenced came later, and its primary purpose was to bail out wall street, something sanders staunchly opposed. some money authorized in the bill wound up flowing to major u.s. automakers, though. “to say that bernie sanders, who has perhaps the strongest pro-worker voting record in the united states congress, does not support automobile workers in their time of need . . . is totally absurd,” sanders said. “it’s unfortunate that she made that statement.” sanders and his aides have tried to argue that none of his tv ads mention clinton by name. but some leave little to the imagination. on friday, sanders debuted a pair of ads in illinois and north carolina, another state that votes tuesday, that say that “while his opponent has flip-flopped on trade deals, bernie has fought them and stood with american workers.” clinton’s positions on some trade deals, including the pending trans-pacific partnership, have, in fact, evolved. as secretary of state, she called the tpp “the gold standard” of trade deals. last fall, she announced her opposition, which she stated even more strongly over the weekend. she has said she now has a fuller picture of what’s being proposed. in the interview, sanders said voters have a right to know where he and his opponent diverge. “the differences are becoming fairly clear to the american people, and the more the differences between her views and my views get out there, the better we’ll be,” he said. clinton doesn’t see it that way. during an appearance saturday in st. louis, she said sanders “has decided to close this election by attacking me and misrepresenting my record and his.” clinton spokesman jesse ferguson said clinton’s campaign thinks sanders has “broken his word” about running a positive race. during a rally saturday in springfield, mo., sanders continued to hammer clinton on trade, saying their views diverged on the north american free trade agreement, which was approved when her husband was in the white house in the 1990s. “i understood at the end of about three seconds that what this trade deal was about was forcing american workers to compete against very, very poor people in mexico,” sanders told his audience. “i have voted against every one of these disastrous trade agreements,” he said. “secretary clinton’s position has been different. she has supported virtually every one of these trade agreements.” boos filled the arena at the mention of clinton’s position. sanders has also raised questions about clinton’s judgment, zeroing in on her decision to deliver a series of paid speeches to corporate interests in the run-up to her presidential bid. that included some addresses to the wall street firm goldman sachs, which paid her $225,000 for one speech. on that subject, sanders hasn’t hesitated to take a snide tone. “the way i see it, if you’re going to give a speech and get $225,000, it must be a really brilliant speech,” sanders told a crowd at the university of illinois on saturday. “it must be opening new vistas of human thought.” he also knocked clinton for refusing to release transcripts of those speeches to the public. she has said she would do so when other candidates are held to the same standard. “let me make a dramatic announcement to all of you here today,” sanders sarcastically told his crowd. saying he was ready to release transcripts of his wall street speeches, he swung open his arms to reveal nothing. “here they are!” he said. the danger for sanders, elleithee said, is not that he will lose die-hard supporters with his tougher tone but that it could be harder to attract new ones — including some who like clinton and are still weighing whether to vote for her. some sanders fans, including samuel nebinger, who turned out saturday night to see the candidate in springfield, say they’re not bothered by the more pointed rhetoric. nebinger said he welcomes it. nebinger, 21, recently dropped out of missouri state university, he said, because it was too expensive, and he now works at a local call center. he was wearing a shirt that said “help us, bernie, you’re our only hope.” “he wanted to run it clean at first,” nebinger said. “but he needed to go on the offensive, because she’s been doing so many corrupt things. she did that to herself.”",0,11,0.0,0,1,0,0.15384615384615385,5.864090909090912,5.836363636363637,0.0,0.0
"‘the boss baby’ bests ‘beast,’ barely, as box office no. 1 - the new york times","los angeles — show business rule of thumb: never underestimate a tot. going into the weekend, most box office analysts predicted that “beauty and the beast” would easily remain the no. 1 movie in north america. one challenger, “the boss baby,” had received negative reviews. (the los angeles times deemed it a “rancid diaper. ”) another new arrival, “ghost in the shell,” had been written off as a contender after becoming embroiled in a “whitewashing” casting controversy. but “the boss baby” — in the tradition of “look who’s talking,” stewie from “family guy” and the baby herman from “who framed roger rabbit” — proved enormously popular, pushing past belle of “beauty and the beast” to take in roughly $49 million. theaters far from the coasts (indianapolis, denver) saw especially strong turnout, according to the film’s distributor, 20th century fox. produced by dreamworks animation, “the boss baby” cost at least $200 million to make and market. it has taken in an additional $59 million overseas. alec baldwin, riding a wave of popularity for his “saturday night live” portrayal of president trump, gave voice to the baby. “beauty and the beast” (disney) had $47. 5 million in ticket sales, for a domestic total of $395 million and a global one of $876 million, according to comscore, which compiles box office data. fizzling in third place was “ghost in the shell,” a version of a japanese manga by shirow masamune. it collected about $19 million — not nearly enough given production and marketing costs of at least $150 million. “ghost in the shell” (dreamworks pictures and paramount pictures) was also weak overseas, where it took in about $40 million. casting scarlett johansson in a role originally played by an asian actor was one misstep. the marketing may have been another paramount’s campaign was visually arresting but failed to broaden the film’s appeal beyond older male fans. and the film was in many ways a mishmash, leading to weak reviews and word of mouth, as evidenced by cinemascore exit polls.",0,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,1.495000000000001,3.0,0.0,0.0
modern technology unlocks secrets of a damaged biblical scroll - the new york times,"nearly half a century ago, archaeologists found a charred ancient scroll in the ark of a synagogue on the western shore of the dead sea. the lump of carbonized parchment could not be opened or read. its curators did nothing but conserve it, hoping that new technology might one day emerge to make the scroll legible. just such a technology has now been perfected by computer scientists at the university of kentucky. working with biblical scholars in jerusalem, they have used a computer to unfurl a digital image of the scroll. it turns out to hold a fragment identical to the masoretic text of the hebrew bible and, at nearly 2, 000 years old, is the earliest instance of the text. the writing retrieved by the computer from the digital image of the unopened scroll is amazingly clear and legible, in contrast to the scroll’s blackened and exterior. “never in our wildest dreams did we think anything would come of it,” said pnina shor, the head of the dead sea scrolls project at the israel antiquities authority. scholars say this remarkable new technique may make it possible to read other scrolls too brittle to be unrolled. the scroll’s content, the first two chapters of the book of leviticus, has consonants — early hebrew texts didn’t specify vowels — that are identical to those of the masoretic text, the authoritative version of the hebrew bible and the one often used as the basis for translations of the old testament in protestant bibles. the dead sea scrolls, those found at qumran and elsewhere around the dead sea, contain versions quite similar to the masoretic text but with many small differences. the text in the scroll found at the excavation site in israel decades ago has none, according to emanuel tov, an expert on the dead sea scrolls at the hebrew university of jerusalem. “we have never found something as striking as this,” dr. tov said. “this is the earliest evidence of the exact form of the medieval text,” he said, referring to the masoretic text. the experts say this new method may make it possible to read other ancient scrolls, including several dead sea scrolls and about 300 carbonized ones from herculaneum, which were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of mount vesuvius in a. d. 79. the date of the scroll is the subject of conflicting evidence. a measurement indicates that the scroll was copied around a. d. 300. but the style of the ancient script suggests a date nearer to a. d. 100. “we may safely date this scroll” to between a. d. 50 and 100, wrote ada yardeni, an expert on hebrew paleography, in an article in the journal textus. dr. tov said he was “inclined toward a date, based on paleography. ” the feat of recovering the text was made possible by software programs developed by w. brent seales, a computer scientist at the university of kentucky. inspired by the hope of reading the many charred and unopenable scrolls found at herculaneum, near pompeii in italy, dr. seales has been working for the last 13 years on ways to read the text inside an ancient scroll. methods like ct scans can pick out blobs of ink inside a charred scroll, but the jumble of letters is unreadable unless each letter can be assigned to the surface on which it is written. dr. seales realized that the writing surface of the scroll had first to be reconstructed and the letters then stuck back to it. he succeeded in 2009 in working out the physical structure of the ruffled layers of papyrus in a herculaneum scroll. he has since developed a method, called virtual unwrapping, to model the surface of an ancient scroll in the form of a mesh of tiny triangles. each triangle can be resized by the computer until the virtual surface makes the best fit to the internal structure of the scroll, as revealed by the scanning method. the blobs of ink are assigned to their right place on the structure, and the computer then unfolds the whole structure into a sheet. the suite of software programs, called volume cartography, will become open source when dr. seales’s current government grant ends, he said. the scroll was brought to dr. seales’s attention by dr. shor. a colleague, sefi porat, who had helped excavate the synagogue in 1970, was preparing a final publication of the findings. he asked dr. shor to scan the scroll and other artifacts as part of a project to create images of all dead sea scroll material, and showed her a box full of lumps of charcoal. “i said, ‘there is nothing we can do because our system isn’t geared toward these chunks,’ ” she said. but because she was submitting other objects for a scan, she put one of the lumps in with other items. dr. shor had the lump scanned by a commercially available, based, tomography machine, of the kind used for scanning of biological tissues. knowing of dr. seales’s work, she sent him the scan and asked him to analyze it. both were surprised when, after several refinements, an image emerged with clear and legible script. “we were amazed at the quality of the images — much of the text is as readable as that of unharmed dead sea scrolls,” said michael segal, a biblical scholar at the hebrew university of jerusalem, who helped analyze the text. the surviving content of the scroll, the first two chapters of leviticus, is part of a listing of the various sacrifices that were performed in biblical times at the temple in jerusalem. although some text has previously been identified in ancient artifacts, “the manuscript represents the first severely damaged, scroll to be unrolled and identified noninvasively,” dr. seales and his colleagues write in the journal science advances. richard janko, a classical scholar at the university of michigan, said the carbonized scrolls from herculaneum were a small section of a much larger library at a grand villa probably owned by julius caesar’s lucius calpurnius piso. much of the villa is still unexcavated, and its library could contain works of latin and greek literature. successful reading of even a single scroll from herculaneum with dr. seales’s method would spur excavation of the rest of piso’s villa, dr. janko said. both dr. tov and dr. segal said that scholars might come to consider the manuscript as a dead sea scroll, especially if the early date indicated by paleography is confirmed. “it doesn’t tell us what was the original text, only that the masoretic text is a very ancient text in all of its details,” dr. segal said. “and we now have evidence that this text was being used from a very early date by jews in the land of israel. ”",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.44923076923077,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0

"uninhibited chinese swimmer, discussing her period, shatters another barrier - the new york times","beijing — the uninhibited fu yuanhui, the chinese swimmer beloved for her expressions, has made waves once again. on saturday night in rio, she freely discussed having her period while competing in the olympics, breaking what has long been a taboo among female athletes. the video of her poolside interview quickly went viral. ms. fu’s remarks came after the chinese women’s swimming team narrowly missed winning a medal in the medley relay. in a interview, ms. fu, who had already won a bronze medal for the backstroke, could be seen crouching as her teammates were questioned one by one. as the commentator turned to her, ms. fu stood up, grimacing in pain. the commentator ventured a guess that ms. fu must be suffering from a stomachache, which ms. fu quickly corrected. “it’s because i just got my period yesterday, so i’m still a bit weak and really tired,” she said. “but this isn’t an excuse for not swimming well. ” ms. fu’s candor immediately attracted a deluge of comments online. on weibo, china’s social media platform, the hashtag related to the subject was searched more than half a million times by the end of sunday, with many commenters expressing their support for ms. fu’s openness. “only those who have gotten their periods know how deathly painful it can be,” one wrote. “you are too awesome. ” a male user wrote, “to compete during her period and still feel bad about placing fourth: fu yuanhui, you are amazing. you are our pride. ” female commenters also took to social media to dispute largely criticism that swimming in a pool while menstruating was unhealthy and unhygienic. “don’t talk to me about staining the pool red or taking medicine to stop one’s period,” a female commenter wrote. “haven’t you heard of something called a tampon?” in many parts of the world, menstruation is still regarded with shame and distaste, though that is changing. in the united states, creative hashtag campaigns on social media and online petitions have challenged the discomfort about topics. female athletes, including the former tennis star annabel croft of britain, have criticized the silence surrounding menstruation in sports. in 2015, the american musician kiran gandhi ran the london marathon during her period sans female hygiene products to protest crossing the finish line with bloodstains prominently on display. yet more open discussion about menstruation has been more slow to catch on in china. when talking about their periods, if at all, women still prefer to use euphemisms like “a visit from my aunt” or “taking a break. ” television ads for feminine hygiene products are banned during prime viewing times as inappropriate. as a result, very few chinese women use tampons, because it is widely, and falsely, believed that they can rob a woman of her virginity. this month, chinese entrepreneurs plan to introduce the country’s first domestic tampon brand. all tampons sold in china have been imported, and most are sold online. in february, anhui province issued regulations allowing women to take up to two days off for menstrual pain, provided they could procure a doctor’s note certifying their symptoms. however, critics feared the practice might have the unintended effect of discouraging employers from hiring women and pointed out that women might still elect to forgo a paid menstrual leave to avoid criticism from male colleagues. “fu yuanhui’s comments have raised awareness, because chinese society still approaches menstruation indirectly, even considering it unlucky,” said chen yaya, a feminist activist and researcher at the shanghai academy of social sciences. “but there’s no need for this at all. the period is simply an everyday phenomenon. ”",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0625,14.895384615384618,17.50769230769231,0.0,0.0

trump-clinton showdown breaks tv debate ratings record as 84 million watch,"new york/los angeles (reuters) - the first presidential debate between democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump drew 84 million u.s. television viewers, a record for such an event and numbers rarely seen on tv in the age of digital streaming and social media. the audience for the monday night face-off beat the 1980 record of 80.6 million set by the jimmy carter-ronald reagan presidential debate, when viewers had far fewer entertainment options. but it fell short of the 100 million viewers some analysts had predicted. the estimated ratings figure from nielsen included people who watched the raucous encounter across 13 u.s. cable and broadcast networks and public television station pbs. the tv figures did not include millions of people who watched the debate online through twitter (twtr.n), facebook (fb.o) and other social media, including in large groups in bars and restaurants. alphabet inc’s (googl.o) youtube reported nearly 2 million live concurrent streams of the debate on its platform. the national football league’s annual super bowl attracts more than 100 million viewers, making it the biggest u.s. tv event. monday’s debate was the first of three scheduled between clinton and trump before the nov. 8 election. the other two are set for oct. 9 and 19. fox news channel (foxa.o) grabbed the biggest cable audience with an average 11.4 million viewers, early nielsen data showed. nbc cmsca.o, whose “nightly news” anchor lester holt moderated the contentious exchanges about race, the economy and national security, was first overall with an estimated audience of 18.2 million. tv networks had promoted the debates for days beforehand and reported strong demand compared with four years ago for commercial time during pre- and post-debate programming. ad rates were far higher than for typical news programming. cnn (twx.n) charged more than $55,000 for 30-second ad spots as part of packages ranging from $800,000 to $1 million that included future debates and election night, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. cbs (cbs.n) charged between $200,000 to $225,000, according to another source. both cnn and cbs have limited availability left for the next debate on oct. 9, the sources said. “clearly the debate did really well last night,” said michael law, managing director of video investments at dentsu aegis network. law said he did not expect ad rates for the next debate would rise significantly based on monday night’s audience. the oct. 9 face-off airs against an nfl matchup of two popular teams - the green bay packers and new york giants. “the nfl will likely do well on that night, but will probably see some fall-off during the 90 minutes of debate,” law said.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.081818181818182,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0

(i’m talking to you, new york!) federal and state laws make it illegal to sell health insurance that doesn’t cover a laughable array of supposedly vital services based on bureaucrats’ medical opinions of which providers have the best lobbyists. as a result, it’s illegal to sell health insurance that covers any of the medical problems i’d like to insure against. why can’t the gop keep obamacare for the greedy — but make it legal for ann to buy health insurance? this is how it works today: me: i’m perfectly healthy, but i’d like to buy health insurance for heart disease, broken bones, cancer, and everything else that a normal person would ever need, but no more. insurance company: that will be $700 a month, the deductible is $35, 000, no decent hospital will take it, and you have to pay for doctor’s visits yourself. but your plan covers shrinks, infertility treatments, sex change operations, autism spectrum disorder treatment, drug rehab and 67 other things you will never need. insurance company under ann’s plan: that will be $50 a month, the deductible is $1, 000, you can see any doctor you’d like, and you have full coverage for any important medical problems you could conceivably have in a million years. mine is a plan (and you don’t have to do the second step, so it’s really a plan). step 1: congress doesn’t repeal obamacare! instead, congress passes a law, pursuant to its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce, that says: “in america, it shall be legal to sell health insurance on the free market. this law supersedes all other laws, taxes, mandates, coverage requirements, regulations or prohibitions, state or federal. ” the end. love, ann. there will be no whining single mothers storming congress with their placards. people who want to stay on obamacare can. no one is taking away anything. they can still have health insurance with free pony rides. it just won’t be paid for with ann’s premiums anymore, because ann will now be allowed to buy health insurance on the free market. americans will be free to choose among a variety of health insurance plans offered by willing sellers, competing with one another to provide the best plans at the lowest price. a nationwide market in health insurance will drive down costs and improve access — just like everything else we buy here in america! within a year, most americans will be buying health insurance on the free market (and half of the rest will be illegal aliens). we’ll have tv ads with cute little geckos hawking amazing plans and young couples bragging about their broad coverage and great prices from this or that insurance company. the obamacare plans will still have the “essential benefits” (free pony rides) that are so important to npr’s mara liasson, but the free market plans will have whatever plans consumers agree to buy and insurance companies agree to sell — again, just like every other product we buy here in america. some free market plans will offer all the “essential benefits” mandated by obamacare, but the difference will be: instead of forcing me to pay a premium that covers mara liasson’s special needs, she’ll have to pay for that coverage herself. i won’t be compelled to buy health insurance that covers everyone else’s gambling addiction, drug rehab, pregnancies, marital counseling, social workers, contact lenses and rotten kids — simply to have insurance for what doctors call “serious medical problems. ” then, we’ll see how many people really need free health care. until the welfare program is decoupled from the insurance market, nothing will work. otherwise, it’s like forcing grocery stores to pay for everyone to have a house. a carton of milk would suddenly cost $10, 000. that’s what obamacare did to health insurance. paul ryan’s solution was to cut taxes on businesses — and make the milk watery. but he still wouldn’t allow milk to be sold on the free market. democrats will be in the position of blocking american companies from selling a product that people want to buy. how will they explain that to voters? perhaps democrats will come out and admit that they need to fund health insurance for the poor by forcing americans to pay for it through their insurance premiums — because otherwise, they’d have to raise taxes, and they want to keep their wall street buddies’ income taxes low. good luck with that! step 2: next year, congress formulates a better way of delivering health care to the welfare cases, which will be much easier since there will be a lot fewer of them. no actual business is going to survive by taking the welfare cases — the ones that will cover illegal aliens and mara liasson’s talk therapy — so the greedy will get government plans. but by then, only a minority of americans will be on the “free” plans. (incidentally, this will be a huge — if anyone cares about the federal budget.) eighty percent of americans will already have good health plans sold to them by insurance companies competing for their business. with cheap plans available, a lot of the greedy will go ahead and buy a free market plan. who wants to stand in line at the dmv to see a doctor when your neighbors have great health care plans for $50 a month? we will have separated the truly unfortunate from the loudmouthed bullies who simply enjoy forcing other people to pay for their shrinks and aromatherapy. and if the democrats vote against a sane method of delivering health care to the welfare cases, who cares? we have lots of wasteful government programs — take it out of lockheed martin’s contract. but at least the government won’t be depriving the rest of us of a crucial product just because we are middle class and the democrats hate us. there’s your health care bill, gop! copyright 2017 ann coulter distributed by andrews mcmeel syndication",0,15,0.0,1,0,0,0.0,10.098571428571429,11.314285714285715,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667

"kerry jabs at trump, warns against isolationism in boston speech","boston/washington (reuters) - u.s. secretary of state john kerry criticized presumptive republican presidential candidate donald trump on friday, warning that isolationist policies would take a toll on the country’s well-being. “you are the most diverse class in northeastern history. in other words, you are donald trump’s worst nightmare,” he jokingly told the 2016 graduates of northeastern university in boston. while he did not mention the billionaire businessman’s name again, kerry alluded to one of trump’s signature proposals - his call to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border. “we will never come out on top if we accept advice from soundbite salesmen and carnival barkers who pretend the most powerful country on earth can remain great by looking inward and hiding behind walls at a time when technology has made that impossible to do and unwise to even attempt,” said the former u.s. senator from massachusetts, who was the democratic nominee for president in 2004. kerry has generally declined to comment on the race leading up to the nov. 8 presidential election, though he has noted that foreign leaders have raised concerns about statements made by candidates, particularly trump. a spokesman told reporters on friday that kerry’s remarks in boston were intended to be lighthearted. “he is not living in a bubble. he is obviously concerned about some of the tone and the effect that is having on foreign leaders,” department spokesman john kirby told a press briefing. “if you’re asking me because he enjoyed a light-hearted moment with students today has he changed his calculus to more aggressively jumping into active debates ... the answer is no.”",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.55,8.0,0.0,0.0

russia and the united states reach new agreement on syria conflict - the new york times,"geneva — russia and the united states agreed early saturday on a new plan to reduce violence in the syrian conflict that, if successful, could lead for the first time to joint military targeting by the two powers against islamic jihadists in syria. the agreement was reached after 10 months of failed attempts to halt the fighting and of suspended efforts to reach a political settlement to an increasingly complex conflict that began more than five years ago. the conflict has left nearly half a million people dead, created the largest refugee crisis since world war ii and turned syria into a prime incubator of recruiting for the islamic state and the nusra front, an affiliate of al qaeda. secretary of state john kerry and his russian counterpart, sergey v. lavrov, announced the agreement in geneva after weeks of negotiations that were marred, in president obama’s words, by deep “mistrust” between the russians and americans, who back opposite sides in syria, but share an antipathy to the islamic jihadists flourishing there. it came at a time when relations between the united states and russia, which have worsened throughout much of the obama administration, have been especially jolted by accusations of russian hacking and subterfuge in american politics. the tensions have been further exacerbated by the effusive praise for president vladimir v. putin of russia by the republican presidential nominee, donald j. trump. the new arrangement on syria, set to begin monday, was greeted with skepticism by syrians on all sides and carries many risks of failure, which the pentagon and mr. kerry acknowledged. “no one is basing this on trust,” he said. “we are basing it on oversight and compliance. ” the plan starts with a continuous “genuine reduction of violence,” in mr. kerry’s words, and broad, unrestricted humanitarian access to the ravaged northern city of aleppo and other besieged areas. if that works, the united states and russia are to establish a joint implementation center, where they will share targeting data, and begin to coordinate bombing of militants of the nusra front and the islamic state. the key element is that russia must then restrain the forces of president bashar of syria from conducting any air operations over areas held by nusra and other opposition forces. the united states hopes this will end the indiscriminate dropping of barrel bombs — including chlorine gas attacks — that have punctuated the conflict. in return, the united states is to persuade the opposition groups it has been supporting to separate themselves from the nusra forces. mr. assad has attacked many of them on the pretense of attacking nusra fighters. american officials expressed strong reservations about whether this new arrangement would work. especially skeptical was the pentagon, long suspicious of russian intentions in syria, since the kremlin first deployed military forces there to help mr. assad a year ago. defense secretary ashton b. carter was among obama administration officials who raised questions over whether either russia or the assad government would comply with the terms. mr. kerry’s announcement of the deal, mr. lavrov at his side, was permeated with caveats. “we believe the plan, if implemented, if followed, has the ability to provide a turning point, a change,” he said. but he sounded far more cautious here than he did in munich in february when he announced an earlier “cessation of hostilities” that failed. the accord was reached after sharp divisions inside the obama administration over the wisdom of sharing targeting information with russia, and accusations that the russians have used the negotiating period to help mr. assad regain control in aleppo and strike at opposition groups. for mr. obama, who asked mr. kerry to keep working on the negotiation after the president failed to reach an accord with mr. putin during the group of 20 summit meeting in china last weekend, the new accord poses considerable risks. for example, if the bombing of nusra sites kills civilians — almost inevitable given the proximity of militant extremist groups and civilians — there are bound to be accusations about who is responsible. pentagon officials are also concerned that russia will use the targeting data to learn more about how american forces identify and attack targets, at a time when forces from the two countries are often near one another around europe. mr. lavrov took a few shots at the united states even while celebrating the arrangement, denouncing “arrogant sanctions” levied against russia for its annexation of crimea two years ago. late on friday, he suggested the united states could not decide about the deal, sending pizza and vodka to reporters to ease the wait, and coming by to joke about how long it took mr. obama and his team to make decisions. but for mr. kerry, reaching this deal has become a personal mission, one that at times put him in conflict with the white house. he has pressed for a stronger military commitment in syria and support for some opposition groups, along with a series of more aggressive covert actions, according to administration officials. mr. obama has been reluctant, as have others in the white house who fear that, even if they could engineer a transition in syria, it could create a power vacuum that iran, russia and militant terrorist groups could exploit. the american skepticism is partly rooted in the failed agreement for a cessation of hostilities reached with the russians in february. that arrangement collapsed weeks later when russia moved heavy artillery into the aleppo area to help mr. assad’s forces. among the syrians, the latest plan was greeted with wariness, particularly from armed opposition groups and their supporters, who, broadly speaking, have come to believe that the united states has lost interest in ousting mr. assad, and is willing to see them wiped out. it is a measure of how little trust the syrians have in the international community — especially after the in february — that initial reactions were lukewarm, even though the deal holds out the possibility of at least a temporary calming of the violence. armed opposition groups read the deal as ordering them to remove nusra fighters from their areas, something they lack the military power to do alone, or else face attack by the united states — a country that has provided some of the rebel groups with training and weapons for years. some government opponents noted that the deal came hours after syrian military forces — with russian air support — their siege of the sections of aleppo. while mr. kerry began his announcement by noting that mr. assad’s airstrikes were, as he put it, “the main driver of civilian casualties and migration flows,” the deal — as partly described — contains many loopholes that could allow them to continue. and no measures were described that would hold any of the parties to account if they violated the terms of a deal that is being struck at a time when the united states has little leverage over russia in syria. the deal allows syrian government warplanes to continue to fly missions in some areas that are to be defined later. and russia and the united states will target areas where they both agree nusra or islamic state fighters are present. what that really means hinges on how russia and the united states define legitimate opposition groups that cannot be targeted under the deal, and how they define areas where nusra is present. the deal also failed to mention anything about the presence of foreign shiite militias — such as hezbollah, which like al qaeda and islamic state is considered a terrorist group by the united states — fighting on the syrian government’s side. it also said nothing about the tens of thousands of detainees in syrian government prisons, whose release had long been touted as a possible measure under a deal. and while it spoke of allowing aid deliveries into besieged areas, it said nothing of lifting the sieges and restoring freedom of movement of goods and people.",0,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.353333333333339,11.333333333333336,0.0,0.0
plan to let migrant children attend school enrages many greeks - the new york times,"oraiokastro, greece — mariya bint loqman abdlkarim is 9. she arrived in greece in february after fleeing syria with her family and crossing from turkey in a rickety boat. since then, she has been living in a shabby camp, her future uncertain, her present reduced to the bare necessities. not long ago, the greek government decided to give her a shot at something closer to a normal life: along with 22, 000 other refugee children, she would be allowed to attend public school starting in october. but as with many aspects of europe’s effort to cope with the huge numbers of migrants who have come to its shores, the plan quickly ran into intense opposition, in this case from parents in a number of communities near camps in northern greece. the refugee children, the parents said, might have contagious diseases. cultural differences, they said, might disrupt learning. last week, an association representing the parents of schoolchildren in the small town of filippiada in western greece sent a letter to local officials and the education ministry, saying “explicitly and categorically that we will not accept, under any circumstance and without any compromise, that the children of irregular immigrants” attend local schools, referring to migrants entering the country illegally. “they come from another continent with completely different diseases and health conditions,” the letter said, adding that the refugees have a “different outlook regarding the role of the family, of women, of religion. ” their presence would “alter the greek character of the schools,” the letter said, adding, “we will not allow religious fanaticism. ” earlier in september, the parents’ association of two schools in the town of oraiokastro in northern greece threatened to occupy the school grounds in protest if refugees from a nearby facility were allowed to join classes. a few days earlier, the local mayor had called on residents to take the law into their own hands amid rumors that some refugees were moving into houses in the area. the parents’ announcements and a video of the mayor’s suggestion that residents “intervene” caused a public outcry and a storm of angry reactions on social media. they also prompted a greek prosecutor to investigate whether the parents’ groups or the local mayor should be charged with racist offenses. since then, both the parents’ groups and the mayor have toned down their responses, saying their only concern is the possible health implication if the refugee children are not vaccinated. the mayor, asterios gavotsis, said his comments in the videotaped meeting were “misinterpreted” and that he was “not inciting anyone to commit illegal acts. ” outside one of the schools, haralambos magoulianos, a retiree waiting to collect his two granddaughters, said he opposed admitting the refugee children. “i don’t like it,” he said. “what happens if we have an epidemic? i don’t want them here,” he added, saying that youths from the nearby refugee camp “steal bicycles and jump into our backyards. ” other parents in the area have been more welcoming. the principal of the school in filippiada and some parents there said the letter sent by the parents in that area did not reflect their views. in oraiokastro, alexandra hapsi, 41, has two children in school. she said she had cooked food and donated clothes for refugees living at the sprawling camp at idomeni, farther north, which was shut this year. “in europe, no one is taking in refugees, and they call us racist,” she said, adding that she also wanted reassurances that the refugees attending local schools had been vaccinated. asterios batos, whose children attend the same school as ms. hapsi’s, leads the group representing the parents’ associations of all 41 schools in the broader region. “this image of a racist municipality is unfair,” he said, referring to the broader region. “we’re not racists. we’re concerned about whether all the right precautions have been taken. ” the plan calls for the migrant children to attend school in the afternoons. initially, they would be kept in classes separate from greek children, but they would eventually be merged into the general student population. in comments to greek television last week, the education minister, nikos filis, said the program for the induction of refugees into schools included vaccinations. the lessons will be in greek, math and english, or another language, depending on where the refugees plan to travel on to. the government has yet to specify which schools will be part of the program, stoking frustration among some parents and local officials. “does a neighborhood or a school have the right to say, ‘i don’t want foreigners here?’ no, it doesn’t,” mr. filis said. the mayor of oraiokastro, mr. gavotsis, said that he was not opposed to refugees’ being educated, but that classes should be held for a year in other venues, such as disused factories, before the children attend local schools. he said the high proportion of refugees in oraiokastro, which has a population of 30, 000, was testing tolerance. “we have 10 percent of all greece’s refugees here,” he said, referring to some 6, 000 migrants at three nearby camps. there are just over 60, 000 refugees in camps across greece. tensions often boil over among frustrated migrants, some of whom have been waiting for months for the outcome of their asylum applications, and many local residents are fed up, holding regular protests. the turmoil has been exploited by members of groups who have infiltrated some of the protests. “we just want a fair distribution,” mr. gavotsis said. “if that makes us racist, what can i say?” katerina karanikolaou, who attended the meeting where mr. gavotsis suggested that local residents “intervene” to stop the education plan, was the only one of 72 parents to vote against a motion to occupy one of the schools in protest. she said the health concerns were a smoke screen. “the xenophobia started with idomeni in february, and it’s taken root since,” she said, adding that residents feared “their town will be downgraded. ” last monday evening, ms. karanikolaou and her four children joined an antiracism rally, marching from the mayor’s office through the pristine streets of oraiokastro, which means “beautiful castle. ” it was named by greek refugees who settled there from 1924 to 1930 after a castle that used to sit on the coast of the black sea. “it’s sad,” ms. karanikolaou said. “our ancestors were refugees. ” around a mile away, in a huge disused tobacco factory, mariya, the girl from syria, lives with her parents and seven siblings in a tent, one of hundreds sheltering some 1, 300 refugees. the camp is filthy — state health officials have called for its closure — but aid organizations run an efficient clinic, vaccinating children against mumps, measles, rubella and hepatitis. stirring chunks of stale bread into a pan with browning onions for the family’s evening meal, mariya’s mother, jihan sheikh mohammed, 33, said she would prefer that her daughter attend a local school rather than receive the makeshift lessons given on site by humanitarian workers. but her father, loqman abdlkarim, 42, is keen to move on, as the family’s next asylum interview is not until april and he has relatives waiting for him in germany. “i will wait another 20 days,” he said. “if nothing happens, then we’ll go back to turkey. even syria is better than this,” he said, adding that drug dealing and sexual abuse were rife in the camp. mariya, a bright, friendly girl, wants to stay. she said she would like to be a lawyer eventually. “helping people,” she said. oblivious to residents’ objections in the nearby town, she is eager to go to a real school, but is nervous about fitting in. frowning pensively, she pointed to her grubby purple tracksuit and bare feet. “will they

top doctors: chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to ‘give no benefit’,"home › health › top doctors: chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to ‘give no benefit’ top doctors: chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to ‘give no benefit’ 0 shares [10/27/16] vicki batts – chemotherapy is arguably one of the medical industry’s biggest frauds . perhaps that’s why it recently landed on a list of ineffectual treatments drawn up by the academy of medical royal colleges (amrc). the list was created by 11 top specialists, who were each asked to think of five treatments they felt provided little to no patient benefits. and surprise, surprise – chemotherapy was one of them. doctors from the amrc said that chemotherapy cannot cure terminal cancer, and may bring unneeded distress in the final months of life. the guardian reported: “the treatment is ‘by its very nature toxic’, the college said. “therefore, the combination of failing to achieve a response and causing toxicity can ‘do more harm than good.'” do more harm than good? you don’t say. research has shown that in some hospitals, up to 50 percent of cancer patients are dying, not from their disease, but from chemotherapy drugs. for the first time ever, researchers actually looked at the numbers of patients who were dying within 30 days of chemotherapy administration , which could indicate that the treatment was the cause of death rather than the cancer. what they found was horrifying. the study, which was conducted by public health england and cancer research uk, found that the average 30-day mortality rate across england was about 8.4 percent for lung cancer and 2.5 percent for breast cancer. but, in some hospitals, those numbers were much higher. for example, at lancashire teaching hospitals, the 30 day mortality rate for palliative chemotherapy for lung cancer was 28 percent. in milton keynes, the death rate for lung cancer treatment soared up to 50.9 percent. the research revealed that the death rate for lung cancer patients was higher than average in several areas, including blackpool, coventry, derby, south tyneside, surrey and sussex. the data also revealed that about 1-in-5 people who underwent palliative care for breast cancer at cambridge university hospitals died because of chemotherapy treatment. of course, the industry was quick to defend their practices, with doctors suggesting that these occurrences could simply be the outcome of data problems, noting that even a few deaths could skew statistics. however, no one really argued with the fact that chemotherapy is indeed a toxin. it doesn’t discriminate; it kills cancerous cells and healthy cells – and therein lies the rub. it may kill the cancer, but not without increasing your risks of getting cancer again in the future. a 2004 study also found that cytotoxic chemotherapy does very little towards enhancing cancer survivors’ 5-year survival rates. the research, which was led by scientists from the department of radiation oncology at the northern sydney cancer centre of the royal north shore hospital, located in sydney, australia, raised serious questions about the actual efficacy of curative and adjuvant chemotherapies. what they found was that in australia chemo only contributed 2.3 percent to the 5-year survival rate in adults, and in the u.s., that number dropped to 2.1 percent. these findings suggest that overall, chemotherapy truly provides very little benefit to any patient’s survival. in their conclusion, the study authors wrote, “as the 5-year relative survival rate for cancer in australia is now over 60%, it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival. to justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy, a rigorous evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required.” the amrc urges doctors and patients to question whether or not particular treatments are necessary. after all, unwarranted and harmful treatments are truly anything but medicine . post navigation",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.356923076923078,14.430769230769233,0.0,0.0
puerto rico governor vows statehood push after referendum win,"new york/san juan (reuters) - puerto rico’s governor on monday said the island’s vote in favor of becoming a u.s. state, despite low voter turnout and widespread boycotts, was “a fair and open” process that u.s. congress should act upon. an island-wide referendum on sunday favored statehood in a 97 percent landslide, though voter turnout reached just 23 percent as opponents of governor ricardo rossello’s push to become a state boycotted the vote. the non-binding plebiscite is not expected to sway the u.s. congress, which would have to agree to make puerto rico a state. currently a u.s. territory, the island is struggling with $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, and is not viewed as a priority in washington. rossello, who campaigned on a push for statehood, said in a telephone interview with reuters that he will go to the u.s. capital this week to urge federal lawmakers to begin the process of admitting puerto rico into the union. “we will make sure this becomes an issue,” rossello said. the vote comes at a critical time for puerto rico, whose hazy status - which dates to its 1898 acquisition by the united states from spain - has contributed to its ongoing economic crisis. last month, the island filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in u.s. history. its woes make statehood even more urgent, rossello said. “statehood brings stability, allows us to have fewer rule-changes from congress, provides resources to our people,” he said. sunday’s referendum, which cost puerto rico between $5 million and $7 million, according to government estimates, was the island’s fifth since 1967 - and the third in which pro-statehood sentiments triumphed, though none have moved congress to act. “if the u.s. is going to go to venezuela and cuba and afghanistan and push democracy abroad, they’ve got to do the same” with their own territories, he said. but puerto ricans are skeptical the island’s status will change. “this has all been a waste of time,” said taxi driver felix salasarar, 54, adding that federal lawmakers will “look at the voter turnout and say, ‘where’s the will of the people?’” working against the governor may be a perception in washington that sunday’s vote was not fair. the u.s. department of justice in april called on rossello to change ballot language that initially did not give voters an option to remain a u.s. territory. rossello told reuters he made that decision because the territory option - which rossello equates to colonialism - already lost in a previous status referendum, in 2012, making this year’s vote a choice between statehood and independence. the justice department viewed the language as politically unfair to millions of puerto ricans who favor territory status, prompting rossello to add the territory option. but the justice department never reviewed or approved the new language. to be sure, sunday’s results do not reflect the true nature of puerto ricans’ views on statehood, which are fairly evenly divided between those who favor it and those who do not, based upon historical election results. statehooder rossello, for example, won his own election with just 42 percent of the vote. but that, the governor said, is how democracy works: “everybody knows that those who go through the voting process have a louder voice than those who don’t,” he said. carolina santos, a single working mother struggling to make her mortgage payments, said bankrupt puerto rico has more important things to worry about than a status vote. “maybe we should focus more on fixing our financial problems and our schools,” she said.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.520000000000003,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0
hilarious! cnn president jeff zucker is hitler [video],"cnn s ratings have been in the toilet ever since they made falsifying news about our president and his nonexistent russian connection a top priority. earlier this week, cnn sunk to a new low when they threatened to release the identity of a private user on social media site reddit, after he made a video showing president trump body-slamming a cnn logo superimposed over the wwe chairman s body. perhaps it s a good time for cnn to think about replacing their vengeful, bully president cnn s president, jeff zucker, responded to the fiasco surrounding his network this week with a jab president donald trump s way, asserting it s the white house chief who s the aggressor in this tiff that the news organization is the victim.zucker s like the playground bully, caught mid-punch, mid-push, now standing before the principal, trying to weasel out of blame. my job is to remind everyone that they need to stay focused doing their job, zuckersaid to the new york times.

voters repudiate clinton,"scott it’s really amazing to see how little of the blame is going to clinton herself. it was her decision to set-up a private email server. it was her decision to serve as secretary of state while accepting millions from foreign governments. it was her decision to get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars while unofficially running for president. it was her decision to call millions of americans deplorable. we have very little idea of what a trump presidency will amount to. my best guess has been that he will be a jimmy carter cubed in berlusconi packaging. recall that even though carter has been the best former president of the modern era, he came to washington as an outsider with his georgia team. despite having ben a governor and thus knowing how to draft legislation and get bills passed, he famously got little accomplished despite having a democratic party majority in the house and senate. trump is likely to spend his first year, and conceivably his entire presidency, with all of the democratic party and enough of the republican party against him to stymie him, fighting for the right to govern. and that assumes he has an agenda beyond the very few goals he has articulated consistently: getting out of “bad” trade deals and entering into better ones; reducing immigration and deporting many undocumented immigrants (and building his famed wall); investing heavily in infrastructure; making nato members pay their share of its budget (the theoretical level, 2% of each nation’s gdp, is largely footed by the us); cutting back our involvement in overseas conflicts; cutting taxes; and repealing obamacare. the only initiatives where the republicans might back him solidly are cutting taxes and ending obamacare, and even then, given the lobbying power of big pharma and the health insurers, the republicans might not be as willing to pull the trigger on obamacare as all their kvetching would lead you to believe. there is one more trump campaign promise that will serve as an important early test of his seriousness as well as his survival skills: investigating clinton. even if obama pardons her, as our jerri-lynn scofield has predicted, it will be critical for trump to carry out a probe of the clinton foundation’s business while clinton was secretary of state. if trump is to cut the cancer of the neocons out of the policy establishment, he has to have them on the run. it is a reasonable surmise that clinton’s enthusiasm for war was due at least in part to heavy saudi support of the foundation. showing that american’s escalation in the middle east, which obama tried with mixed success to temper, was due in part, and perhaps almost entirely, to the personal corruption of the secretary of state, would keep the hawks at bay, particularly if other prominent insiders and pundits were implicated in clinton foundation influence-peddaling. it will be hard for trump to do much to alter the course of the military-surveilance complex unless he can hamstring the warmongers. just as warren has argued relative to bank regulations, “personnel is policy.” if trump is a fast learner, he’ll see that that is just as true on the foreign policy front. finally, those on the left need to turn the blame cannon aimed squarely at them back on the professional hacks who are truly responsible. despite their tiresome chest-beating about meritocracy, these acela corridor bubble-dwellers are constitutionally incapable of holding their fellow club member accountable. their preening self regard repelled hard-working americans who’d done the right thing, as in gotten an education, and if they were older, launched a career, bought a house and started a family, only to struggle harder and harder while seeing any vestige of security and hope of improved living standards erode. and unless they were at the top of the professional classes, they felt defeated by not being able to pay for their kids to go to college and being uncertain as to how to advise them with their educations and job prospects. the democrats under clinton and obama abdicated the duty of the elites, which is to improve the conditions for, or at least limit harm to, the members of the communities they lead. even bill clinton did remember that the most important duty for a democrat is to create jobs, even if he did so by presiding over a rise in household debt and a stock market bubble. young people, who poll well to the left of their elders, have inferred a lesson that the labor movement forgot: the exercise of power includes being willing to inflict punishment in the form of withholding support. look at how diminished organized labor has become by casting its lot with the feckless dems who’ve sold them out again and again. hillary tried the clinton “they have no where to go” trick one time too many, kicking the left after she only narrowly beat sanders. and the left decided to return the favor. she made clear she has no intention of representing them. they heard her message loud and clear and acted accordingly. as reader aab : the big question to me is, take over the hollow shell of the democratic party, or crush it with a new party. is it possible to take over the ds — as weak as it is now as a party — without being corrupted and co-opted? i now hate my former party to such a degree, i find myself recoiling at having anything at all to do with it. but given all the institutional constraints, it still may be smart to try; the answer is above my pay grade, as they say. this is an important question to consider as we see how the democratic party responds to this well-deserved defeat. 0 2 0 0 0 0",1,3,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,17.04666666666667,14.533333333333335,0.0,0.0

slain reporter's boyfriend calls for violence discussion,"(cnn) one day after reporter alison parker, 24, and her cameraman, adam ward, 27, were gunned down on live television near roanoke, virginia, parker's boyfriend said merely remembering their lives is not enough. ""there needs to be some action that is taken out of an event like this -- out of an event like sandy hook, like charleston, like aurora, colorado... where these things just don't occur anymore,"" chris hurst told cnn on thursday, citing a litany of american gun violence. ""we need to have a substantive conversation on what is going on in america that is allowing evil to continue to crop up over love? is it because we are in the media? and the attacker knew this was going to get a lot of play, and here we are again, another mushroom cloud of coverage over gun violence?"" on wednesday, vester lee flanagan ii produced a real-time murder show that he choreographed in detail. in a ranting note sent to abc news before his death, flanagan blamed his misery on black men and white women and said he was ""somewhat racist against whites, blacks and latinos."" flanagan shot dead parker and ward while she was live on air on wdbj via ward's camera, a video of the incident showed. hurst works at the station as an anchor and had been dating parker for nine months. they were already talking about marriage. he was saving for an engagement ring, he said. ""i think the media can have an even stronger effect to be positive if we can use this as a conversation in figuring out why we are allowing hate to creep into people's hearts instead of fostering love,"" he said at memorial for the victims. ""we need to ask why this is happening, and we need to keep the conversation going. we don't want to keep it going because it's tiresome and then, we just wait for another one to happen, and we say, 'this is a huge issue,' and then forget about it until another one happens... if we don't forget, i think the incidents will lessen. i believe that."" parker's father, andy parker, told cnn's anderson cooper on thursday night that he will honor his daughter's memory by lobbying for laws that will make it harder for the mentally ill to purchase firearms. it was not clear whether flanagan had been diagnosed with a mental illness. ""after sandy hook, and the theater shootings, everybody thought, gosh this is terrible,"" he said. ""we have got to do something to keep people that are mentally disturbed, we got to keep them away from guns and having the ability to get guns."" it's up to the media, he said, to prevent the story from fading. ""that's what the [national rifle association] is thinking right now,"" parker said. ""the nra is saying, it will go away. and, you know, they are the most powerful lobby in the country. and someone has got ... to take them on. by god, i am going to do it."" parker was reluctant at first to speak to reporters about his daughter's killing, but her career as a journalist changed his mind. the first 24 hours after her death were filled with numbness, uncontrollable grief and anger, he said. ""she was kind and she was sweet and she touched everybody,"" he said. he didn't go nicely back then, and ward recorded his emotional outburst on camera. court documents from a discrimination suit that he filed show that flanagan scoffed at ward and flipped off the camera. before police walked him out of the building, flanagan handed his manager a small wooden cross and said, ""you'll need this."" flanagan had not worked with parker, the reporter he shot dead, but there were signs he resented her having been hired. wdbj's general manager said flanagan had run-ins with many co-workers and was a poor performer. flanagan's performance and behavior problems led to his bosses referring him to the company's employee assistance program, marks said. the managers did not request he reach out to the program because of his mental state -- they didn't know about that -- but because of his difficulty working with others, marks said. the final warning for the reporter came in december 2012, and he was fired in february 2013. flanagan caused a stir and police were called to escort him out, marks said. flanagan gave the news director at the time a cross and said ""you'll need this,"" marks said. all of the claims that flanagan made against the company and were investigated marks said. those investigations concluded that no reasonable person would have taken the alleged instances as discrimination or harassment, he said. vester flanagan owned several websites associated with gay porn, records show. flanagan registered at least seven domain names in 2007 and 2008, and solicited ""attractive & muscular men"" to model for live web cams. records obtained by cnn show flanagan's name and vallejo, california, address were included in the domain registrations. the shooter planned meticulously to act out a lot of resentment violently and get back into the limelight before turning his gun on himself. flanagan, aka williams, recorded video of his killing, which he spread on social media as he fled authorities. he appeared to have prepped his twitter account days before the killing with a review of images from stations of his life. during his flight, posts to twitter appeared in the name of bryce williams, showing video recorded from the perspective of his gun barrel as his shots struck his victims. many social media users were horrified by the scenes playing out before them on autoplay. both facebook and twitter quickly shut down the accounts. flanagan had rented a car weeks before and used it in his getaway instead of his own car, a 2009 ford mustang. virginia state police spotted the rental car on interstate 66. a trooper tried to pull him over, police said, but he refused to stop and sped away before running off the road and crashing into an embankment. troopers found flanagan inside with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, virginia state police sgt. f.l. tyler told reporters. he was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead wednesday afternoon. flanagan was known for a series of anger and behavioral problems in his workplaces. as news broke about whom police sought in the killing, don shafer heard a familiar name on the radio. ""vester flanagan. he worked for me,"" he said to himself. ""the hair on the back of my neck went up,"" said shafer, who is now news director at xetv in san diego. when he hired flanagan, shafer was news director at wtwc in tallahassee, florida. the reporter who went by bryce williams made a nice impression on shafer at first, but in 2000, he fired him over run-ins with colleagues. ""there were some issues with him and his personality that kind of spiraled down, and that's why we had to get rid of him,"" shafer said. flanagan sued, alleging racial discrimination, but the suit was dismissed. later, he joined wdbj but was later fired over performance issues. he sued again, once more alleging discrimination. court documents from that suit revealed the station had taken disciplinary action against flanagan for months, met with him many times about angry behavior and told him to seek counseling. dan dennison, former news director at wdbj, said it was the toughest termination decision he'd ever handled. he had to call police to escort the reporter out. ""(williams/flanagan) had a level of a long series of complaints against co-workers nearly from the beginning of employment at the tv station,"" dennison said. he said they were never substantiated. the firings and lawsuits were part of a mishmash of resentments that flanagan faxed to abc news, while police searched for him. in a ranting note in his farewell fax, flanagan tried to justify his killings. ""ok, so the big question is 'why?' "" he wrote. ""well, after i compiled well over 100 pages chronicling the hurt in my life, i asked myself, 'why not?' "" and he talked about having a disturbed mind. ""i've been a human powder keg for a while ... just waiting to go boom!!!! at any moment,"" he wrote. he spent some time making allegations of racism, including against reporter parker, whom he said ""made racist comments"" but got hired anyhow. there was no elaboration, and wdbj general manager marks said the claim was unfounded. ""we're outraged that any of the comments in that manifesto are taken the least bit seriously,"" he said, adding that he doesn't believe that flanagan and parker crossed paths at wdbj. but flanagan also blamed much of his misery on black men and white women and said he was ""somewhat racist against whites, blacks and latinos."" flanagan said he put a deposit down for a gun two days after the charleston, south carolina, church shooting in june and ranted against the accused shooter. ""as for dylann roof? you (deleted)! you want a race war (deleted)? bring it then you white (deleted)!!!"" the fax said. police recovered two guns from flanagan, glock 9 mm pistols he purchased legally.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.740000000000002,19.942857142857143,0.0,0.0
conflict over russia is rocky start for trump and intelligence agencies,"washington (reuters) - president-elect donald trump’s rejection this weekend of u.s. intelligence analysts’ conclusion that russia intervened in the 2016 election to help him win the white house is the latest in a string of conflicts between trump and the intelligence community he will command. most of them involve russia, which has grown increasingly aggressive - according to what u.s. intelligence agencies have told congress and the administration of president barack obama - in syria and ukraine. the agencies also reported that russia has ratcheted up activities in cyberspace including meddling, sometimes covertly, in european and u.s. elections. the intelligence agencies have concluded with “high confidence” that not only did their russian counterparts direct the hacking of democratic party organizations and leaders, but they did so to undermine democratic candidate hillary clinton, not just to shake confidence in the u.s. electoral system, a senior u.s. official said on friday. the president-elect’s transition office responded by releasing a statement that exaggerated his margin of victory and attacked the u.s. intelligence community’s work on iraq, but did not address the analysts’ conclusion about russia. “these are the same people that said saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction,” the statement said. “the election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history. it’s now time to move on and ‘make america great again.’” in a statement issued on saturday, california democrat adam schiff, a member of the house intelligence committee, called the russian hacking of the u.s. election “spectacularly successful.” “one would also have to be willfully blind not to see that these russian actions were uniformly damaging to secretary (of state hillary) clinton and helpful to donald trump,” schiff said. “i do not believe this was coincidental or unintended.” trump has rejected the intelligence agencies’ finding. “i don’t believe they interfered,” he told time magazine about russia in an interview published this week. “that became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. any time i do something, they say, ‘oh, russia interfered.’” russian officials have denied all accusations of interference in the u.s. election. the president-elect has been receiving the president’s daily brief (pdb), one of the most highly classified documents in the u.s. government and which can include details of u.s. and allied covert operations, only once a week. that is far less often than most of his predecessors.so far, intelligence officials said, trump has not requested a special briefing on russia, despite the agencies’ warnings that russian president vladimir putin is trying to undermine trans-atlantic unity and test u.s. and allied resolve. in fact, two officials with knowledge of the situation said on saturday that trump’s transition team has made only “incidental contact” with the central intelligence agency. this is despite the fact that trump’s choice to head the cia, u.s. representative mike pompeo, has limited experience working with the agency. the kansas republican served on the house intelligence committee and the select committee investigating the 2012 attack on u.s. diplomatic and intelligence facilities in benghazi, libya. democrats and some republicans in congress who have been briefed on the russian activities share the intelligence agencies’ alarm about trump’s plans for the 17-agency intelligence community, which includes the national security agency, the defense intelligence agency and the national counterterrorism center. privately, some members of the clandestine service, the cia’s body of spies, said they would resign rather than obey any order to resume waterboarding or other “enhanced interrogation techniques” that trump endorsed during his campaign.elsewhere in the $70 billion-a-year intelligence community officials on saturday said they fear that trump might invite legal trouble by trying to vastly expand electronic and physical surveillance of suspected terrorists based on their religion or national origin. none of that may come to pass, of course, and campaign rhetoric and tweets do not always predict policies, the officials conceded.however, trump’s statements about russia and business dealings there, as well as those of retired army lieutenant michael flynn, his choice for national security adviser, are worrisome to many of the officials tracking putin’s growing aggressiveness from seas to skies to cyberspace. obama has ordered the intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention into the 2016 election and deliver a report before he leaves office on jan. 20, the white house said on friday. obama’s homeland security adviser, lisa monaco, told reporters on friday the report’s results would be shared with lawmakers and others. “the president has directed the intelligence community to conduct a full review of what happened during the 2016 election process ... and to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders, to include the congress,” she said during an event hosted by the christian science monitor.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.154545454545456,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
racist vandalizes bernie sanders supporter’s car then brags about it online,"a bernie sanders supporter s car was vandalized by andy hallinan. the man put two stickers over top of the woman s bernie sanders stickers. the stickers say warning: this car is an mfv. the letters mfv are short for muslim free zone. the owner of the car saw photos of her vandalized car online. hallinan posted two photos of himself before and after he put the stickers on the car, then posted them to them his businesses facebook page. hallinan is the owner of florida gun supply, a gun store in inverness, florida. he has previously made headlines when he posted a video on his store s facebook page, where he declared that the gun shop is a muslim-free zone. the council on american-islamic relations called on the department of justice to investigate the matter, claiming that banning muslims from his store is a violation of federal law.the owner of the car wrote a post on facebook where she said: i was at a barnes and noble today in millbury ma. i was drinking coffee and using my computer and posting and reading lots and lots of things about bernie sanders like i have been doing for some time now. anyhow i come out to my car to find 2 stickers over my bernie sanders stickers. as soon as i got to an internet connection again i went to look up what the fuck the stickers where for and then i found a pic of my car on their website not only did they vandalize my car in my opinion they were trying to use my car to promote hate. and posted to their own fb page the sticker says warning this car is a mfz which means a muslim free zone the car owner confronted hallinan on his facebook page where she was mocked by the page s fans:social media is a powerful tool that lets people come together from all over the world to share ideas. unfortunately, some of those people are only interested in spreading hate. hallinan is not only interested in spreading his bigoted message he s actually trying to profit from it by selling bumper stickers and promoting his store.featured image from screenshot via facebook",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.08333333333333333,10.154545454545456,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
conviction against brendan dassey of ‘making a murderer’ is overturned - the new york times,"a federal judge on friday overturned the murder and sexual assault convictions of brendan dassey, one of the defendants whose case was the subject of the wildly popular netflix documentary series, “making a murderer. ” mr. dassey, 26, must be released from prison within 90 days unless the authorities schedule a new trial, according to the order from a federal judge in the eastern district of wisconsin. in 2007, mr. dassey was convicted of participating in the murder and sexual assault of teresa halbach, a photographer, and sentenced to life in prison. the series by laura ricciardi and moira demos, released in december, suggested that police investigators unfairly questioned mr. dassey, then 16, without a lawyer or parent present. it suggested he was mentally unfit, was coerced into a confession that he later recanted, and that his lawyer, len kachinsky, was content to cut a deal. in the court order, the judge, william e. duffin, said state courts erred in finding that investigators never made mr. dassey promises during his interrogation on march 1, 2006. “the investigators repeatedly claimed to already know what happened on october 31 and assured dassey that he had nothing to worry about,” judge duffin wrote. “these repeated false promises, when considered in conjunction with all relevant factors, most especially dassey’s age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult, rendered dassey’s confession involuntary under the fifth and fourteenth amendments. ” the documentary also questioned the conviction of mr. dassey’s uncle, steven avery, who was also convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. mr. avery was not affected by the court order on friday. “today there was a major development for the subjects in our story and this recent news shows the criminal justice system at work,” ms. ricciardi and ms. demos said in a statement. “as we have done for the past 10 years, we will continue to document the story as it unfolds, and follow it wherever it may lead. ”",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.255714285714287,14.171428571428573,0.0,0.0
kerry says has not been contacted by fbi over new clinton email review,"aherlow, ireland (reuters) - u.s. secretary of state john kerry said on sunday he had not been contacted by the fbi about new investigative steps being taken related to hillary clinton’s use of a private email server when she led the state department. the fbi on friday said it was investigating more emails in what the democratic presidential candidate described as “deeply troubling” behavior 10 days before the u.s. elections. “i haven’t been notified of anything, no, i haven’t been requested of anything, no, i’m not aware of the department being requested, and i have no further comment to make,” kerry told a news conference in ireland. “as an american citizen and former nominee of the party, there is a lot i’d like to say about what is going on, but i can’t and i am just going to remain out of this,” he added. clinton on saturday challenged fbi director james comey to provide a fuller explanation of investigative steps he is taking related to her use of a private email server. comey had decided in july that the fbi was not going to seek prosecution of clinton. but on friday he said the agency was trying to determine whether additional emails contained classified information. republican presidential nominee donald trump, who has been reeling for weeks from the release of a 2005 audio tape in which he boasted about groping women, has seized on the fbi move as evidence clinton is unfit to lead the country. kerry was in ireland to accept the tipperary international peace award, joining recipients like former south african president nelson mandela, united nations secretary general ban ki-moon and former u.s. president bill clinton. kerry is due to travel to london on monday for talks on libya that will seek to break a political stalemate over the country’s u.n-backed unity government.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.44923076923077,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0

boeing reponds to trump’s air force one tweet: you’re a f**king idiot,"update: slate has pointed out that the pentagon has budgeted $4 billion in total spending through 2021 for two new air force ones from the company. if one plane is four and earmarked r&d is the black-and-white cost of the project, he s right. it isn t, and he isn t. the pentagon s earmarked funds are not the projected budget by boeing. donald trump made news this morning for a tweet stating: boeing is building a brand new 747 air force one for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. cancel order! boeing is building a brand new 747 air force one for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. cancel order! donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) december 6, 2016i don t know where he got that idea. like many of trump s ideas, it was likely pulled from the ether, or maybe from the ass of a white nationalist on twitter. boeing was quick to set him straight, however considering the project is more than an order of magnitude less than trump thinks it is. here s boeing s statement on the matter:we are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the united states. we look forward to working with the u.s. air force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the american taxpayer.according to rueters, in january, when the contract was awarded, details about the total value of the new contract have not been released, but the air force has previously said that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement jets. costs and the number of jets can change, but it s still not clear at all what trump is talking about. even various right wing publications which have blown up the cost over the last year have not reported a figure over three billion, and even that was not sourced to any budget sheet.and, no matter the cost, it s very clear that donald trump has no idea what is being paid for. there will be multiple planes, first of all two or three and even if the project did run that far over budget (there is no evidence of that), it s not just the president s version of a private jet:what drives the price tag isn t the cost of the plane, it s all the costly modifications and equipment that must be installed on such a unique aircraft, said loren b. thompson, a senior aviation analyst and industry consultant with the virginia-based lexington institute.air force one is filled with communications gear and defensive equipment to evade airborne threats, such as anti-aircraft missiles. it s really not just about getting the president from point a to point b, buckley said. it s adding communication equipment. it s adding defensive gear. it s adding everything that the president needs in order to execute his mission in that airplane. he has to be able to do everything in all his roles: commander in chief, chief executive, head of state, president of the united states. boeing s 747 is the only u.s.-built jet that can support all the functions required of an airborne white house, thompson said. the plane must be linked to all u.s. military forces worldwide and able to function even in the midst of a nuclear war.

sarah palin: my husband nearly dying made me realize how important it was to elect trump (video),"just as sarah palin was set to deliver another pro-trump stump speech, the one-time republican vice presidential candidate learned that her husband, todd, had been involved in a serious snowmobile accident in alaska and was in bad condition in the intensive care unit. she cancelled one event, but didn t go home. instead, she returned to the campaign trail that same day and delivered one of the most pathetic endorsements of trump yet. she even found a way to exploit her husband. it was painful to watch.it almost makes you feel bad for todd palin. lying in his hospital bed, watching his wife use his moment of need to promote the guy she thinks will keep her relevant.never one to let a family crisis go to waste (remember when she managed to turn her son s brutal beating of his girlfriend into a critique of obama?), palin told the gathered trump crowd that the experience of learning her husband almost died made her immediately realize how important her time was and that she needed to spend it getting trump elected.the audience went wild.incoming word salad (recorded verbatim): yeah, good to be here. thawed out and little alaskas. literally thawed out. just before i got on a flight to get out here, he s out ice fishing on our frozen lake and my husband s out snow machinin and thank you guys for your prayers for my husband who is recovering right now in icus after a little wreck on a snow machine. so thank you. big wreck. thank you. but, you know, when real life happens, right? when someone is sick in your family, there s an accident that happens, all these challenges, these struggles in your business, in your family, with your finances, tryin to get your kids to be able to afford to go to college, all these real life issues that happen, it really puts things into perspective, doesn t it? and doesn t it make you so appreciate your time time is our most valuable resource. it makes me appreciate the time that we have to spend in doing something so worthy. and that s to get donald j. trump elected president.when palin learns her husband is badly injured, she takes the experience to appreciate how important it is for her to shill for donald trump. that really does put things into perspective, doesn t it? palin: todd s accident made me appreciate the by tommyxtopherfeatured image via fox10 screengrab",1,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.15,11.169411764705881,11.505882352941178,0.058823529411764705,0.0
u.s. agriculture secretary nominee submits ethics disclosures,"(reuters) - u.s. president donald trump’s nominee to head the agriculture department said in senate ethics disclosure forms that he would place his assets, which include part ownership of a grain merchandising company, into a blind trust. republican sonny perdue was tapped to head the department the day before trump’s inauguration. progress on his confirmation has been slow, with media reports suggesting that undoing his various business entanglements caused the delay in the ethics filings. representatives for perdue did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment on the delays. the divestiture plan was disclosed in filings posted online over the weekend by the u.s. office of government ethics. submitting the ethics filings is a key step toward possible confirmation. perdue, the former governor of georgia, also said he would resign his positions from the national grain and feed association, the bipartisan policy center governor’s council and the georgia agribusiness council. perdue has received strong support from agricultural trade groups. the senate agriculture committee has not yet released a schedule for his confirmation hearings.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,19.16857142857143,25.65714285714286,0.0,0.0
"as donald trump stumbles, hillary clinton watches her step - the new york times","on thursday, hillary clinton took a break from in los angeles to appear on “the ellen degeneres show. ” on friday, she will fly to seattle for a private and on monday, billy crystal, along with matthew broderick and miranda, will host a donor soiree on mrs. clinton’s behalf. with donald j. trump plunging in the polls amid new allegations of sexual assault and the continuing furor over the “access hollywood” recording, what mrs. clinton will not do is anything that could rattle a race that has shifted solidly in her favor. she enters the final stretch of the presidential campaign with cautious optimism about the outcome. unlike most presidential candidates, who spend the last weeks before election day holding a succession of big rallies, mrs. clinton seems to see no reason to pack her public schedule. after thursday, the democratic nominee had no public appearances scheduled for the rest of the week, and her campaign has not announced additional events before next wednesday’s third debate with mr. trump, in las vegas. aides point to rallies in florida, colorado and arizona this week and say mrs. clinton has spent her downtime preparing for the debates. they have criticized mr. trump for shunning debate preparation, to his detriment. but her relatively light schedule also signals a newfound confidence inside the campaign as mrs. clinton seeks to get out the vote among specific constituencies and avoid making any unforced errors. after a shaky september, mrs. clinton has surged to an lead over mr. trump in a race, up from a advantage last month, according to an nbc street journal poll conducted over the weekend. democrats expect that lead to widen in the aftermath of the second presidential debate, the tape that surfaced last week in which mr. trump can be heard making lewd comments about women, and the new accusations of sexual assault. on monday, mrs. clinton drew her largest crowd yet, 18, 500 people, to an outdoor evening rally at ohio state university in columbus. nearly 2, 700 voters came to a rally on wednesday in pueblo, colo. campaign aides attribute the larger crowds to fury over what they call mr. trump’s tactics. “we think people are turning out to show support for her taking on trump,” said jennifer palmieri, a spokeswoman for the clinton campaign. “we see we’re hitting goals in voting registration, and enthusiasm on our side is growing. ” but in a fractured news media landscape, a boisterous campaign rally packs less punch than it used to and aides said they can more effectively target voters through other means. and the headlines about mr. trump of late underscore the clinton campaign’s assumption that dominating the national news is not always a good thing. in recent weeks, mrs. clinton has talked about her youth in an interview with snapchat she choked up discussing police brutality with the singer mary j. blige she talked about the time she got a bad haircut in high school with an interviewer and about the problems facing haitian communities with a prominent miami bishop and she has talked to her own campaign’s “i’m with her” podcast. (recent topics include “presidents are people, too. ”) “rallies work for electric candidates, and hillary clinton is not an electric candidate,” said thomas sander, who runs a program on civic engagement at harvard’s kennedy school of government. “it’s easier to find a sympathetic talk show host who gives you a chance to control the message. ” rallies can also be fraught with risks. a conservative radio host and trump supporter, alex jones, has offered a cash prize to anyone who will interrupt clinton events with chants accusing bill clinton of rape. two protesters were escorted out of mrs. clinton’s rally in miami on monday, where she and al gore talked about climate change at an event focused on young voters. mrs. clinton has a cadre of democratic leaders to campaign on her behalf, including her husband president obama and michelle obama vice president joseph r. biden jr. senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and senator bernie sanders of vermont. “rightly so, they know that if she is not out there making news, it is much more interesting to cover whatever donald trump said today,” said russell j. schriefer, a republican political strategist and former senior adviser to mitt romney. “they know that ultimately plays to their benefit. ” indeed, the clinton campaign has gleefully watched as mr. trump has escalated his war with the republican establishment, publishing a web video on wednesday called “the final meltdown” that features a montage of mr. trump’s latest insults. ever since mrs. clinton had to take a few days off the campaign trail to recover from pneumonia last month, democrats are sensitive about the implication that she is taking it easy. mr. trump has mocked mrs. clinton’s schedule and accused her of not having the “stamina” to hold multiple rallies a day. he recently released an ad that implies she is not healthy enough to hold the presidency. (mrs. clinton’s physician has said she is in “excellent health. ”) “by the way, let hillary clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way i talk and let’s see how long she lasts, folks,” mr. trump told a crowd in ocala, fla. on wednesday. mrs. clinton has held 19 rallies in the 38 days since labor day, the official kickoff of the general election campaign, compared with mr. trump’s 32 rallies, according to a new york times tally. but she has had a stream of stops at community centers and small discussions targeted at specific voters. in charlotte, n. c. this month, mrs. clinton spoke at a black church and then had a discussion with community leaders about the recent police shooting of keith lamont scott and ensuing unrest in the city. the talk changed the impression shaun corbett, 37 and owner of da lucky spot barbershop, had of mrs. clinton. “i can see how a lot of people would say she’s cold,” mr. corbett said, the hum of the razor in the background. “but i saw that she’s just about her business. ” direct outreach to voters like mr. corbett can be more valuable than rallies with crowds. “it’s got to be quality over quantity, return on investment,” said tracy sefl, a democratic strategist who advises the campaign on women’s outreach. mrs. clinton’s campaign expects at least 40 percent of votes in battleground states to be cast early. “we actually think that states like nevada, north carolina and florida could be decided before election day,” said robby mook, the campaign manager. democrats say that despite mrs. clinton’s solid performance in the first two debates, she will still attend her usual “debate camp” and grueling preparation sessions with aides in westchester, n. y. and las vegas. after the final debate, mrs. clinton is expected to make her closing argument with a more robust schedule of rallies, and may even make stops in states like georgia and arizona where the margin has tightened.. “you take nothing for granted,” said joel benenson, mrs. clinton’s chief strategist and pollster. “you campaign all the way to the end, and you regularly look at what’s ahead and you manage time and resources to get the most value out of the candidate’s time around the country. ”",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.06666666666666667,6.726153846153846,8.276923076923078,0.0,0.0
"hastert loses one illinois pension, keeps another after sentencing","chicago (reuters) - illinois stripped former u.s. house of representatives speaker dennis hastert of his teacher’s pension on wednesday, but his sentencing for a federal financial crime linked to past sex abuse will not cost him a second, more lucrative state pension. the state teachers’ retirement system moved swiftly after hastert’s sentencing by ending his $16,622-a-year annuity from 16 years of teaching in a far western suburb of chicago, where the sexual abuse to which he admitted occurred. but hastert will not lose his $28,025 annual pension from his six years as a member of the illinois house of representatives. the teachers’ retirement system, in ending hastert’s pension, cited an illinois law that prohibits retired educators from drawing pensions if they are found guilty of a felony arising from their service as teachers. hastert was sentenced by a federal judge in chicago on wednesday to 15 months in prison, followed by two years of probation and sex-offender treatment for a financial crime related to his sexual abuse of high school wrestlers he coached decades ago. as a teacher between 1965 and 1981, hastert’s contributions to the teachers’ retirement system totaled $16,327. since 1997, hastert received $237,045 in pension payments, the agency disclosed. but his benefit from his years as a member of the illinois house of representatives will continue because the crime to which hastert admitted happened after 2010, more than two decades after his departure from the illinois statehouse, said timothy blair, executive secretary for the state general assembly retirement system. “the one charge on this that stuck happened well after his time in the general assembly,” blair said. “obviously, it couldn’t be related to his role as an elected official here.” as a legislator, hastert contributed $19,805 to his legislative pension and has received $420,524, blair’s agency disclosed. the federal agency that administers congressional pensions did not respond to questions about hastert on wednesday.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.831111111111113,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0
how buzzfeed is using social media “news” feeds to teach white kids to hate themselves,"does your child spend time on social media? unless they re amish, you should probably assume they do. my teenage daughter just shared with me one of the most racist, self-loathing articles with me that i have ever seen in print. this is the most hateful, racist articles aimed at shaming young, white americans that you ve have ever seen. as we took a closer look at students featured in this buzzfeed article, we were stunned by some of the racist postings we found on their social media accounts.i suppose it s okay for buzzfeed to publish an article with the sole purpose of bashing its young white users, because thanks to barack and michelle obama (the ultimate victims), who have been sowing the seeds of racism, division and hate from the white house, it s perfectly acceptable to trash white americans. never mind that barack obama is the president of the united states. what black united states president who was elected twice by a majority white nation would still consider himself and his wife victims of racism? here are some of the examples we found from the buzzfeed article titled: 19 school powerpoint presentations that give zero f*cks this article, and hundreds more just like it, show up in your children s snapchat social media feeds, a place where teenagers and young adults frequently go to interact with each other, and where they are constantly bombarded with leftist indoctrination garbage like this: controversial tay appears to be very proud of herself and how she s stirring it up at school, she actually goes as far as to say, one day i feel like my professors just gon stop letting me do presentations. hmmm wonder why?one day i feel like my professors just gon stop letting me do presentations pic.twitter.com/gr8oopdqeg controversial tay (@misstayamari) november 17, 2016robin had the white kids shook by her presentation. how did she think it was going to make them feel good? wasn t that exactly the reaction she was going for?i had these white kids shook pic.twitter.com/z8e3vplkff robin (@thyrobin) october 21, 2016here s indigo whose got a bucket ready for your white tears. when the homie comes through with follow up pic.twitter.com/1lipsjdxxd indigo (@miesh_b) december 14, 2015as an added bonus, we also found this video on indigo s twitter account: watch this disrespectful black teenage girl attack her teacher during class, and twist his words to fit her narrative after he said, i want [america] to control the borders. she quickly turns it into a race issue, using his statement about the controlling the borders to suggest he, doesn t want too many latinos in our country. she tells him because you are white and you are so closed-minded that he doesn t accept the truth. the teacher calls her out on her previous statement that, white people are in control of everything, by asking her what color our current president is? watch how she quickly blames congress for being white, which apparently makes a black man who holds the highest office in our nation somehow insignificant. amazing pic.twitter.com/4fevzv49dh (@emotioneiie) november 16, 2016one of the most race-obsessed teachers on social media that i have ever seen, posted this tweet to his twitter account. he calls himself zellie and this is his twitter profile: all black everything. teacher. blogger. activist. brother. son. contact: zellie.imani@gmail.comdoes anyone wanna take bets about whether or not he would be offended if he saw someone on twitter saying they were all white everything ?in any case, buzzfeed chose one of his twitter posts that shows a student telling a group of students if you believe there is diversity, you re probably a racist. :i'm ready for this workshop. pic.twitter.com/p0okfdy8vp zellie (@zellieimani) november 7, 2015and another post by the race-obsessed teacher made it to buzzfeed s top 19 most racist social media posts. here is #7.oh look white people who wanna be a nigga! the teacher who calls himself zellie on twitter used laughing emoji s when he shared this on twitter as a way to express to viewers how funny he thought this was:professors about to stop assigning presentations. pic.twitter.com/4yulajezdx zellie (@zellieimani) december 18, 2015this user brags about how she s about to shame her fellow students by suggesting, she about to fry them. #love it! :now this one is just plain hilarious! here s a white student who appears to be giving the presenter his full attention and respect, while this black student (who is the presenter) places white people are a plague to the planet on the screen for the entire class to see. pretty funny huh? you can see why buzzfeed chose them as their #9 pick:pretty sure i just got an f on my presentation. pic.twitter.com/7tdprsquup shahem .

"illinois governor vetoes chicago pension fix, angers city's mayor","chicago (reuters) - illinois governor bruce rauner on friday vetoed a legislative fix favored by chicago mayor rahm emanuel for two of the city’s struggling pension funds and castigated it as a “kick-the-can approach.” the financial footing and credit ratings for the nation’s third-largest city have slipped precipitously as its unfunded pension liabilities grew to $33.8 billion for chicago’s four retirement systems in the most recent accounting. the plan that passed the illinois senate unanimously in january and cleared the house overwhelmingly last december would have granted the state’s blessing to alter the city’s pension repayment schedule for its municipal and laborers’ retirement systems. the systems are projected to run out of money in the coming decade and were depending on legislative sign-off of the city’s enactment of a water and sewer usage tax and telephone surcharge designed to help get them 90 percent funded in 40 years. city officials have acknowledged that more money will be needed starting in 2023 when payments will reach actuarially required levels. but rauner rejected the package, saying it created a payment schedule that eventually would necessitate a tax increase for chicago. he said it needed to be part of a broader, statewide pension funding strategy to address illinois’ $129.8 billion unfunded pension liability. “this is another kick-the-can approach to pension funding that landed chicago in fiscal crisis in the first place,” rauner said in a prepared statement. “this bill will create an unsustainable funding schedule that will lead to tax increases without solving the real problem.” a spokesman for the democratic mayor slammed the republican governor’s action as an “irresponsible and irrational decision.” “instead of helping secure the future of our taxpayers and middle-class retirees, the governor chose to hold them hostage – just as he has done to social service providers, schoolchildren and universities across the state,” emanuel spokesman adam collins said in a statement, referring to rauner’s inability to broker a state budget deal for 21 months. rauner’s action left democrats with no ability to block his veto because the pension bailout passed in the previous session of the state general assembly, which ended in mid-january, and the governor’s only options were to approve or reject the measure. but the city is pinning its hopes on an identical piece of legislation that passed the newly seated state senate in late january and is awaiting action in the house, collins said.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.142222222222227,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0

presidential hopeful hilary clinton has pledged to set up a no-fly zone in syria. the russian ministry of defense has warned that there may be no time for any hot-line discussions with the americans about stealth aircraft or incoming missiles. no time for talks, meaning anything in the air will be shot down, bringing the two nuclear powered nations ever closer to a confrontation. 2. lebanon’s new face the power vacuum in lebanon has ended with the election of the leader of the christian free patriotic movement party as president. michel aoun secured the votes of 83 out of 127 mps at parliament, capping a political impasse which dragged on for over two years. aoun is a strong ally of lebanon’s resistance movement hezbollah and his election is seen as a disappointment for israel and saudi arabia, two enemies of what is known as the axis of resistance of which hezbollah is a main pillar. aoun was earlier endorsed by leader of the pro-saudi political party march 14 saad hariri. 3. yemen heading for partition no end is in sight for the crisis in yemen : the country’s former president abd rabbuh mansur hadi has said ‘no’ to a peace proposal put forward by ismail ould cheikh ahmed, the un special envoy for yemen. the details of the plan have not been made public, but according to some sources, it gives yemen’s ansarullah movement and its allies a share in the country’s future government. the serious disagreement between forces loyal to hadi and the ansarullah movement has sparked fears over yemen’s possible partition. two parallel institutions in sana’a and aden are in the making which may end up partitioning of the country. israel plans to build new settler units in east al-quds nov 2, 2016 – israeli authorities say a municipal building-permit sub-committee has approved technical details of plans in the gilo area. they say more detailed building permits will be required before the settler units are built. the project was first approved in 20-12 and wednesday’s approvals have been seen as open defiance of international calls to stop settlement expansion on the occupied palestinian territories. all israeli settlements are illegal under international law. israel destroys bedouin village for 105th time brave people fighting with occupation nov 2, 2016 – a palestinian bedouin village has been demolished by israeli forces, and it’s not the first time. for the 105th time, araqib village in the negev desert was destroyed by israeli bulldozers backed by troops. according to israeli police, a number of buildings were demolished. palestinians say israelis confiscated vehicles and possessions of residents of the village. the first demolition of araqib took place in 20-10. there are approximately 160 thousand bedouins residing in the occupied territories. authorities have repeatedly refused to connect bedouin villages to the national water and electricity grids. rights groups claim that the israeli policy to destroy bedouin villages is aimed at removing the indigenous palestinian population to make room for the expansion of israeli communities. the baltics watch some background: the baltic republics lost about 50% of their population and 90% of their industries built by the ussr after they got occupied by the west in the 1990s. due to the russia’s countersanctions they have lost about 85% of their trade with russia and stand to lose the rest in the next two years. mostly, what’s left it’s income from the use of the baltic ports for oil and coal transfer. the baltic republics run by pro-fascist governments and deliberately violate every human right of their ethnic russian population. dress warm, pack condoms, hide: lithuania writes guerilla manual for russian invasion estonia: 500 estonian troops

the victorious allies of war world ii. the us government and the “military-industrial complex” were against this offer. an end of the cold war would have shaken their supremacy. how did they manage to bring about the failure the summit? there is an official version, and a story that is told the first time in this documentary. according to official history, the summit in paris failed because of krushchev´s anger. related to the u-2-incident, that spy plane of the cia. according to the official history, the soviets alone are responsible for the division of germany. the official history denies the existence of nuclear tests in patagonia, invents an „heroic kidnapping“ of a nazi war criminal by israeli agents and describes the earthquake in chile as a natural event. a true “intelligence fabric” had been built around the summit conference by the cia and the pentagon, consisting of several provocations: shortly before the summit, a u-2 spy plane violated russian airspace – at an altitude that made it impossible for the soviet air defense not to detect it. while eisenhower was staying at the disarmament summit, his generals arrived in argentina with four aircraft carriers – full of nuclear explosives. they wanted to conduct nuclear tests, said the newspaper. these tests however were at that time prohibited by the us-soviet moratorium and by the us atomic energy law. during the summit, the cia took russian hostages. but the us nuclear tests in argentina ended in catastrophe. thousands of people died. they had to cover up everything. but in the archives of the us,

stephen miller is a ‘true believer’ behind core trump policies - the new york times,"washington — staff members on capitol hill recall stephen miller, the white house adviser behind many of president trump’s most contentious executive orders, as the guy from jeff sessions’s office who made their inboxes cry for mercy. as a top aide to mr. sessions, the conservative alabama senator, mr. miller dispatched dozens and dozens of bombastic emails to congressional staff members and reporters in early 2013 when the senate was considering a big bipartisan immigration overhaul. mr. miller slammed the evils of “foreign labor” and pushed around nasty news articles on proponents of compromise, like senator marco rubio of florida. one exhausted senate staff member, forwarding a to a reporter at the time, wrote: “his latest. and it’s only 11:45 a. m. ” the ascent of mr. miller from gadfly with little policy experience to the president’s senior policy adviser came as a shock to many of the staff members who knew him from his seven years in the senate. a man whose emails were, until recently, considered spam by many of his republican peers is now shaping the trump administration’s core domestic policies with his economic nationalism and positions on immigration. but his unlikely rise is emblematic of a white house where unconventional résumés rule — where the chief strategist is stephen k. bannon, until recently the head of the website breitbart news, and the president himself is a former reality television star who before winning the nation’s highest office had never shown much interest in the arcana of governing. yet all three men are bound by a belief in an economic policy that has suddenly moved from the fringes of american politics to the oval office. “stephen was the kind of guy who would make a passionate ideological argument to a roomful of people who were there to make pragmatic decisions,” said alex conant, a former aide to mr. rubio who remembers squaring off against mr. miller at a routine republican messaging meeting that turned into a immigration debate. mr. miller has been at the epicenter of some of the administration’s most provocative moves, from pushing hard for the construction of a wall along the border with mexico to threatening trade deals at the heart of republican economic orthodoxy, to rolling out mr. trump’s travel ban on seven largely muslim nations, whose bungled introduction he oversaw. working in an administration that “didn’t come here to do small things,” as mr. bannon has put it, is a role that mr. miller — universally known as a tireless worker — has been preparing for much of his life. from his days at a public high school in southern california, where he preached against “political correctness” and liberalism and called in to conservative radio shows, to his time at duke university, where he was known for controversial writings in the student newspaper and a failed attempt at a run for dorm president, he has delighted in challenging prevailing orthodoxies. at a freshman mixer, recalled a college classmate who spoke on the condition of anonymity, mr. miller announced, “my name is stephen miller, i am from los angeles, and i like guns. ” mr. miller, known for his skinny ties, ’ pants and his recently abandoned habit, enjoyed a relatively ascent in mr. trump’s orbit until the travel ban. his eagerness to keep a tight lid on key details of executive orders to prevent leaks — as well as his inexperience — has at times hampered coordination between the west wing and agencies that would have to carry them out, several white house officials said. in part to deal with the confusion that surrounded the travel ban, reince priebus, the white house chief of staff, recently created a protocol that requires all major executive actions to be cleared with the communications department and other senior white house staff members before implementation. but mr. miller’s peacock confidence has served him well with mr. trump, who first got to know him in 2015, when mr. miller helped bring mr. sessions, now the attorney general, into the trump fold. after the republican national convention in july, mr. miller became mr. trump’s principal speechwriter once the candidate had switched from handwritten notes to a teleprompter in the middle of the campaign. the message in those speeches was so reflective of mr. trump’s views that it earned mr. miller a spot as the act for mr. trump’s campaign rallies. his words became mr. trump’s — “we’re going to build that wall, and we’re going to build it out of love,” mr. miller often said. “steve is a true believer in every sense of the word, not just in this message of economic populism but in president trump as a leader,” said jason miller, who worked with him in the trump campaign and is not related. “steve’s fiercely loyal and has a better understanding of the president’s vision than almost anyone. ” it is sometimes hard to tell mr. trump’s voice from that of mr. miller, who suppressed his own orotund speech to capture the president’s more visceral, style. not that he has had much choice: as one of three or four staff members to fly around with mr. trump during the last few months of the campaign, mr. miller was summoned to speechwriting tasks by a bark of “ready!” from mr. trump, who insisted on dictating practically every word — and laced into staff members who changed a word or inserted an overly complex policy point. mr. miller’s flexibility as a speechwriter is offset by the consistent stridency of his political philosophy, which has remained much the same since he was the distinct minority at santa monica high school, a liberal outpost where he often railed against fellow students and the school administration. mexican heritage celebrations and iraq war protests were things of particular offense. he produced a 2003 essay, “how i changed my left wing high school,” that capped a high school career steeped in political activism. at duke, mr. miller, who is jewish, cut a similarly confrontational swath, and was briefly friendly with richard spencer, who later became a prominent white supremacist, when both were members of the university’s young conservatives chapter. from there, it was straight to capitol hill, where mr. miller worked for representatives michele bachmann of minnesota and john shadegg of arizona before ending up with mr. sessions in 2009. mr. sessions and mr. miller worked tirelessly against the congressional effort at an immigration overhaul. the bill passed the senate easily in spite of mr. sessions’s vociferous objections, but failed in the house. “we knew we were taking on the establishment, and steve was an incredibly hard worker and had no second thoughts about it,” mr. sessions said in an interview. mr. miller wrote many of the incendiary speeches that mr. sessions gave about the bill, including one in which he suggested that a aide to senator chuck schumer, democrat of new york, had been the author of a measure that he believed to be “amnesty” in disguise. ultimately, it was mr. miller’s dour views on illegal immigration that endeared him to mr. bannon and a small team of economic nationalists that included julia hahn, a former breitbart writer. the group came together during the 2014 campaign of the republican candidate dave brat, whose upset win over the house majority leader, eric cantor, in a suburban richmond, va. district augured mr. trump’s success. even then, mr. miller had his eye on mr. trump, who had flirted with a run for president in 2012. soon after mr. brat’s victory in the republican primary in july 2014, mr. miller sent his friends a breitbart interview in which mr. trump declared, “everybody is vulnerable because what’s happening in the country is very sad, and the world is watching. ” mr. miller added a comment: “trump gets it. i wish he’d run for president. ” mr. bannon, mr. miller and the head of the domestic policy council, andrew bremberg, spent the later part of the transition period mapping out a protocol of executive orders, sending more than 200 to federal agencies for review. the trouble came when they sent some of them to officials at federal agencies for review, leading to leaks that prompted mr. miller to restrict the circulation of the plans. mr. trump, initially pleased by the bold series of executive actions orchestrated by the team, was stung by the fallout from mr. miller’s execution of the immigration order, and expressed frustration about not being fully briefed on an order reorganizing the national security council to give mr. bannon additional power. despite the internal mr. miller remains close to the mr. bannon, who described him in an

top bush admin. official just filed ethics complaint against fbi director for partisan meddling (updated),"comments fbi director james comey is being publicly criticized by former deputy attorney generals and others from the law enforcement community over breaking his agency’s neutrality to release a vague memo friday afternoon which amounted to official slander against democratic candidate hillary clinton. newsweek’s kurt eichenwald reported first that university of minnesota law professor and former bush administration white house ethics counsel richard painter filed an official ethics complaint with the department of justice’s office of special counsel against the fbi director for abusing his office with pernicious political activity. richard painter’s new filing against comey is similar to the complaint filed by the democratic coalition against trump , lodged against the fbi director for violating the hatch act , which restricts most federal employees from engaging in any partisan activity. hours after originally filing this story, professor painter wrote this op-editorial in the new york times to explain why the fbi director’s actions must not go unpunished: on saturday, i filed a complaint against the f.b.i. with the office of special counsel, which investigates hatch act violations, and with the office of government ethics. i have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers’ ethics, including two and a half years as the chief white house ethics lawyer for president george w. bush, and i never thought that the f.b.i. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. until this week. an official doesn’t need to have a specific intent — or desire — to influence an election to be in violation of the hatch act or government ethics rules. the rules are violated if it is obvious that the official’s actions could influence the election, there is no other good reason for taking those actions, and the official is acting under pressure from persons who obviously do want to influence the election. absent extraordinary circumstances that might justify it, a public communication about a pending f.b.i. investigation involving a candidate for public office that is made on the eve of an election is thus very likely to be a violation of the hatch act and a misuse of an official position. serious questions also arise under lawyers’ professional conduct rules that require prosecutors to avoid excessive publicity and unnecessary statements that could cause public condemnation even of people who have been accused of a crime, not to mention people like mrs. clinton, who have never been charged with a crime. this is no trivial matter. we cannot allow f.b.i. or justice department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. that is an abuse of power. allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more, and even worse, abuses of power in the future. ironically, the hatch act was passed because republicans thought that employees from one of fdr’s new deal agencies were involved in partisan electioneering. little did they know that, today, a registered republican fbi director was going to violate it blatantly right before an election. painter and comey were colleagues in the bush administration when the latter held a position as deputy attorney general. high ranking current department of justice officials discouraged comey from going public just 11 days before a general election. shamefully, it’s been revealed that the fbi doesn’t even have a warrant to view these newest emails yet. former deputy attorney generals jamie gorelick and larry thomspon, who served administration with both parties, issued a harshly worded op-ed in the washington post today entitled, “ james comey is damaging our democracy .” they opined: as former deputy attorneys general in the bill clinton and george w. bush administrations, we are troubled by the apparent departure from these standards in the investigation of hillary clinton’s email server. first, the fbi director, james b. comey, put himself enthusiastically forward as the arbiter of not only whether to prosecute a criminal case — which is not the job of the fbi — but also best practices in the handling of email and other matters. now, he has chosen personally to restrike the balance between transparency and fairness, departing from the department’s traditions. as former deputy attorney general george terwilliger aptly put it , “there’s a difference between being independent and flying solo.” at the same time, attorney general loretta e. lynch — nominally comey’s boss — has apparently been satisfied with advising comey but not ordering him to abide by the rules. she, no doubt, did not want to override the fbi director in such a highly political matter, but she should not have needed to. he should have abided by the policy on his own. the fbi director broke policy to inform congress about details of an investigation without any actual details, or having even seen the new evidence that was so urgent that he had to break decades of policy in order to disclose it. even stone age conservatives knew that these latest allegations are nothing more than a partisan political ploy, describing the trump campaign’s reaction in grim terms: in trumpworld as hitler's bunker terms, this is probably like when goebbels thought fdr's death would save the nazi regime. — ross douthat (@douthatnyt) october 28, 2016 within hours of comey’s official memo breaking, he released an internal “cover your ass” memo admitting that the letter could be misinterpreted, which was instantly leaked to the washington post and proved that the fbi director understood fully the foolishness upon which he had embarked by interfering with an election. newsweek pointed out that republican president george w. bush had undergone fbi investigation himself before being elected, but nobody in the clinton white house or the fbi used it to torpedo his 2000 presidential campaign. bush investigated in 96. cleared. imagine if fbi came out in 2000, just be4 election, said ""new evidence, dont know what it means."" horrible — kurt eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) october 30, 2016 amazingly, a blogger made requests in 2004 before the election and did get the fbi to release some files about then-president bush in april of 2005, only five months after the election, but he suspected that they didn’t provide everything and the records show that his requests to expedite release because of the election were denied. the bush fbi files contained nothing about the events reported by kurt eichenwald. the two former deputy attorney generals said it best : as it stands, we now have real-time, raw-take transparency taken to its illogical limit, a kind of reality tv of federal criminal investigation. perhaps worst of all, it is happening on the eve of a presidential election. it is antithetical to the interests of justice, putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy. now, the fbi’s top leadership is in open revolt over the director’s political meddling as bipartisan condemnation is raining down upon the fbi director, as his colleagues are openly telling the press that their boss compromised their agency to play partisan politics. it’s probably only a matter of time before comey resigns and faces his own investigation for this entire sordid affair.",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.721666666666671,19.0,0.0,0.0
is hillary panicking over the fbi and weiner emails?,"is hillary panicking over the fbi and weiner emails? these past few days have seen a major shift in the clinton tactics. during the original investigation, the clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at republicans for ""wasting time"" investigating hillary, but did not attack the fbi. it misrepresented fbi statements, but it certainly did not target investigators in the way we're seeing now. but now we have open hostilities between lynch at the doj and the fbi. we have the clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the fbi. we have countless media hit pieces aimed at the fbi. the obvious question is why. the clinton campaign kept its cool, at least to some degree, before. it certainly didn't begin an ill-advised campaign against the fbi. that's the kind of tactic that may play to your core base, but alienates everyone else. that is to say everyone who isn't in the media. so what's going on here? 1. the clintons thought they were done. it's close to the election. so they're lashing out. it's typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the clintons. hillary tried playing humble. she tried apologizing. but a moment ago, her victory seemed inevitable, and now she's in a state of fury at having it put at risk. 2. there is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the clinton campaign. which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the fbi with both barrels. it's desperate to smear the fbi as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges. the attacks are a warning to treat hillary with kid gloves again... or else. the first is plausible. to a degree. but for all of hillary's awkwardness, she didn't lose it in the past. why is she losing it now? there's no evidence beyond speculation for the latter. and yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking. if the clinton campaign were panicking, this is what it would look like.",1,9,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,11.520000000000003,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0

trump's tax cut won't be the biggest in u.s. history,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump repeatedly says his proposed tax cut would be the biggest in u.s. history, but it will not even come close to the record. trump would be on target if he were talking only about corporate taxes, but he has included other taxes in his boast. the president and his fellow republicans in congress propose cutting the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. if they succeed, it would be the largest american corporate tax cut since the modern corporate tax began more than a century ago. as proposed by the republicans, the corporate rate would fall 43 percent, compared with the second-largest such cut of 26 percent under republican president ronald reagan in the 1980s. but on individual taxes, trump's claim does not hold up, according to data on top personal income tax rates collected by the tax foundation, a washington think tank. (for a graphic tracking u.s. tax rates, see: tmsnrt.rs/2z5cv20) some republicans in congress are backing away from cutting the top individual tax rate, now 39.6 percent. but even if they did cut it as low as trump wants, to 35 percent, the president would not even come close to winning bragging rights. the reagan cuts lowered the top rate to 28 percent from 70 percent. that was an impressive 60 percent drop. but the huge tax cuts of president warren harding and president calvin coolidge, both republicans, take the prize. in 1922, the top tax rate was 73 percent. by 1925, it was only 25 percent, almost a 66 percent decline. coolidge alone was responsible for a 57 percent cut in taxes. under president john kennedy and president lyndon johnson, both democrats, the tax cuts of 1964 and 1965 cut the top rate to 70 percent from 91 percent, a decline of 23 percent. still, there are other ways to measure the size of a tax cut besides the rates themselves. one approach would measure how much tax revenue the federal government does not get and taxpayers get to keep. that is the “cost” of a tax cut. but that number is disputed between those who favor tax cuts and those who do not. the trump administration argues its tax cuts will ignite the economy and tax revenue will increase, not decrease. that way, the cuts “pay for themselves,” they say. the committee for a responsible federal budget, a bipartisan washington think tank, estimated the trump tax cut could be the fourth-largest as a percentage of gross domestic product, or gdp, a measure of national economic output. the think tank favors that measure because it eliminates the effects of inflation, economic growth and the size of total federal revenue. by that measure, it agreed with a number of economists who said the reagan cuts were the largest in history, even larger than coolidge’s. as for bragging rights to the all-time biggest tax hike, the winner is democratic president woodrow wilson. during world war one, he increased the top individual rate to 77 percent from 7 percent and the corporate rate to 12 percent from 1 percent.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.650000000000002,4.0,0.0,0.0
brazil's meirelles jokes about a vice presidential candidacy,"sao paulo (reuters) - brazil s finance minister henrique meirelles insisted on monday that he is not planning to run for president and told a business meeting he could consider being a vice presidential running mate. but he later told reporters that it was just a joke and he was too busy working on the recovery of the brazilian economy as minister to consider the presidential race next october. meirelles, whose political fortunes are expected to rise as the brazilian economy recovers from its worst recession, said he had been asked to be a vice presidential candidate in 2010 and 2014 and found the position interesting. meirelles said he expected brazil s gdp to grow at least 2 percent next year and the strengthening economy had created more than 1 million jobs so far this year. inflation slowing to below bottom-end of the official target range will allow the central bank room to cut interest rates further, meirelles added. if brazil s congress fails to approve the reform of the pension system proposed by the government, the task will be the first challenge of the next president who will take office jan 1, 2019.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.130000000000003,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
"eu threatens poland over logging, risks fresh clash with right-wing government - breitbart","brussels (afp) — the eu warned poland on thursday it may take legal action to stop logging in a unesco world heritage forest, risking a new clash with warsaw’s government. [brussels gave poland one month rather than the usual two to address its concerns about the ancient bialowieza forest or face being summoned by the eu’s top court. “one month was considered the right time considering the urgency of the situation,” european commission spokesman enrico brivio told reporters. he said poland’s reply to requests to stop logging in the forest was “not satisfactory” amid concerns it could cause irreparable biodiversity loss. the bialowieza forest includes some of europe’s last primeval woodland and has been granted protected status by the un heritage organisation. the threat comes with brussels and warsaw already at loggerheads over changes to poland’s constitutional court which the eu has warned could merit sanctions as a “systemic threat” to the rule of law. since the populist pis administration came to power in warsaw in october 2015, it has come into conflict with brussels on several fronts. the eu launched both the logging inquiry — based on a complaint by environmentalists — and the rule of law investigation last year. if the logging case goes before the european court of justice, poland could face fines. but if found at fault on the rule of law poland could face the far more serious prospect of seeing its eu voting rights suspended. the bialowieza forest straddles poland’s eastern border with belarus and is home to unique plant and animal life, including a herd of some 800 european bison, the continent’s largest mammal. the vast woodland includes one of the largest surviving parts of the primeval forest that covered the european plain ten thousand years ago. the polish government began logging in may last year, saying it was clearing dead trees to prevent damage caused by the spruce bark beetle, and insisting the policy was entirely legal.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.723333333333333,8.133333333333335,0.0,0.0
umass students hold ‘sh*t-in’ for gender-neutral bathrooms,"posted 11/16/2016 2:11 pm by patriotrising with 0 comments students at the university of massachusetts, amherst are staging a week-long “shit-in,” occupying restrooms in an administration building to demand more gender-neutral facilities. gender liberation umass, the student group behind the demonstration, announced tuesday that administrators had “tentatively agreed to progressive ‘benchmarks’ put forth by organizers,” but urges supporters to remain on-call. students at the university of massachusetts, amherst are staging a week-long “shit-in,” occupying restrooms in an administration building to demand more gender-neutral facilities. the “ shit-in at whitmore ” demonstration began monday morning at the whitmore administration building (which the activists have nicknamed “queermore”), and organizers intend to have students continue occupying stalls in the building’s male and female restrooms until their demands are met, though the facebook event specifies a friday afternoon ending. “maybe [administrators] will feel a little bit as anxious as trans students do just trying to pee on campus.” tweet this gender liberation umass (glu), a student group at umass, is responsible for organizing the event, and provides an online sign-up form for supporters to stake out specific times and locations, giving them the option of stating whether they prefer to be along in a stall or to share one with “other sitters.” the primary goal of the protest is to convince the administration to convert additional bathrooms on campus into gender-neutral facilities by changing the signage, which the group believes will promote “trans inclusivity and safety on campus,” but glu has also articulated two additional demands, pledging to continue obstructing toilets until all three are met. in addition to gender-neutral restrooms, the group is calling for the “advancement of medically and socially competent in-house transgender health services at the university health services center,” as well as the “hiring of a professor by the wgss [women, gender, and sexuality studies department] who is an expert in the field of critical transmisogyny from an intersectional perspective.” divest umass, a student environmentalist group, released a statement on its facebook page expressing solidarity with the glu protesters “these demands are elementary, and it is disappointing that umass has failed to meet the needs of trans and gender non-conforming students to date. the administration must seriously put a plan into action to de-gender its facilities,” the message declares. “in the meantime, maybe they will feel a little bit as anxious as trans students do just trying to pee on the campus they pay tuition to every single day.” although the objectives of divest umass are not directly related to those being pursued by glu, but leaders of the divest group explained their interest in the “shit-in” by asserting that all progressive causes are interrelated, saying, “there can be no climate justice without gender justice. there can no be gender justice without racial justice. there can no be racial justice without economic justice. there can be no economic justice without social justice.” within a day of the restroom occupation starting, glu announced that it had secured a meeting with vice chancellor of student affairs enku gelaye on tuesday morning to discuss its demands, and subsequently reported tuesday evening that administrators had “tentatively agreed to progressive ‘benchmarks’ put forth by organizers.” “the administration is definitely listening and the tones of our conversation have changed quite a bit,” one glu member told campus reform , though the group is cautioning its supporters to remain prepared, because “the need for action may arise at any moment.” “changing the signage really is not very expensive, and i don’t want to talk bad about the administration here, but that’s one of the things we’ve had to go back and forth about, is this idea of the cost of it,” another glu member added. “i and other members of glu think the numbers they have proposed for what it would cost to change the signage are way beyond what it would really be.” umass executive director of strategic communications ed blaguszewski, however, told campus reform that the university is committed to expanding the availability of gender-neutral restrooms, making no mention of cost concerns while asserting that university officials would continue to meet regularly with transgender students to discuss their concerns. “currently, there are more than 200 gender-inclusive, single-user restrooms on campus, and during the coming year more than 50 will be added, either by construction or by converting single-user ‘men’ or ‘women’ facilities to ‘restrooms,’” he explained, adding that “all new construction and major renovations on campus will include gender-inclusive restrooms.",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.368571428571428,8.514285714285714,0.0,0.0
same-sex marriage may be law in australia by early december,"melbourne (reuters) - australian lawmakers on thursday vowed to push through laws legalizing same-sex marriage by early december, after a national survey found the majority of australians favored the move. both prime minister malcolm turnbull s liberal-national coalition government and the main opposition labor party said they were aiming to pass the law through parliament by dec. 7. that timeline was even earlier than the christmas deadline named by turnbull on wednesday after the country s statistics agency reported that 61.6 percent of voters surveyed favored marriage equality, with 38.4 percent against. legislation was rushed into the national parliament s upper house senate late on wednesday, even as colorful celebrations in the major cities continued and congratulations rolled in from international supporters. if the legislation passes as expected, australia will become the 26th nation to legalize same-sex marriage, a watershed for a country where it was still illegal in some states to engage in homosexual activity until 1997. the legislation faces some opposition from conservative lawmakers in the coalition, who have pledged to introduce amendments to protect religious freedom that would allow discrimination against same-sex couples. attorney-general george brandis moved two amendments on wednesday, seeking to extend protection to civil celebrants to refuse to officiate same-sex weddings. they ll move amendments and some of them will be accepted, turnbull told a radio station on thursday. we re cracking (getting) on with it. a rival bill proposed by the conservative faction that would have included widespread protections for religious objectors, including florists, bakers and musicians, to refuse service to same-sex couples was withdrawn after being widely condemned. full debate on the bill, which was introduced by senator dean smith, a member of the coalition and the country s first openly gay lawmaker, is scheduled to begin on nov. 27. almost 80 percent of the country s eligible voters took part in the voluntary public survey - a higher voter turnout than britain s brexit vote and ireland s same-sex marriage referendum.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,8.0,0.0,0.0
czech president's spokesman likens eu to third reich in outburst over spirit ingredient,"prague (reuters) - the czech president s spokesman likened the european union to the third reich of adolf hitler on thursday while criticizing the bloc s executive over a regulation on food safety. jiri ovcacek made the comment while citing the case of an ingredient in a czech potato-based alcohol locally known as rum that cannot be labeled that way due to an eu ban which says the term must be reserved for cane-based spirits. the eu s food watchdog, the european food safety authority (efsa), has ruled that the ingredient, called rum-ether, should be discontinued and replaced gradually from april 2018 on the grounds that it contains a material that can damage body cells. ovcacek shared an article from a czech news website on his facebook page on the issue, adding the comment: the empire has decided that there will be no tuzemak (czech rum) to drink in the protectorate. empire in the czech context is often understood to refer to hitler s third reich, while the protectorate is what the country was called by the nazi regime during world war two. when asked about the comment, ovcacek said his words were warranted because such actions by some in the eu damaged its reputation. it points to the absolute insensibility of the european commission, ovcacek said. ovcacek s comments have led to controversy before, such as his outbursts against prime minister bohuslav sobotka and some of his ministers, and even against the czech media. czech president milos zeman has portrayed himself as a europhile and fan of a federal eu. but he has also expressed pro-russian and anti-immigration views and built up relations with china, in contrast to the pro-western and human rights-based style of czech foreign policy established by the late president vaclav havel.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.264615384615386,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0
doubts linger after florida's scott pitches biggest budget,"new york (reuters) - after deep cuts in spending for florida schools and other public programs following the great recession, outgoing republican governor rick scott this month proposed an $87.4 billion budget he says boosts spending on some depleted services to record levels. despite scott’s meaty 2018-2019 budget recommendation, which is about $2.4 billion above current spending, advocates for florida public education, environment and affordable housing remained skeptical the new plan would go far enough. “it doesn’t move florida (schools) out from the bottom when compared to other states,” said mark pudlow, spokesman for the florida education association, the state’s teachers union. florida’s public school per-pupil spending sank from a peak of $7,126 in the 2007-2008 budget to a post-recession low of $6,217 for the 2011-2012 year. in his latest proposal, scott recommended increasing funding to $7,176 per student, a $50 rise above record-high per-student funding. florida has more than 2.7 million students enrolled in its public k-12 schools. pudlow said he welcomed the governor’s increases, but support for florida education was still lagging far behind most of the united states. the nationwide per-student spending average was $11,392 in 2015, according to the most recent u.s. census bureau data available. adjusted for inflation, pudlow pointed out, scott’s budget puts florida’s per-student spending at about $1,200 less than it was at its peak. scott proposed increasing public elementary and secondary school spending to about $14.71 billion from some $14.45 billion in the current fiscal year. andrea messina, executive director of the florida school boards association, said she was hopeful scott’s proposal signaled a an attitude shift in the state capital toward public education financing, but the bill was far from final. the florida house of representatives and senate will hear the governor’s budget recommendations at the next legislative session starting on jan. 9. they then make their own budget proposals and negotiate until a single plan is agreed on. that budget will go back to the governor, who has the authority to veto line items before signing off on the bill. scott has also proposed $180 million in cuts to taxes and fees and asked for sharp increases in spending on departments, including corrections, which would see more than 500 added jobs under the plan. the budget for environmental protection would surge to more than $1.7 billion from $1.48 billion in the current year, making it among the budget’s biggest gainers. florida everglades restoration would be among the environmental projects to receive an infusion of funds. “that’s one place where we’re happy, although the devil is in the details,” said frank jackalone, director of sierra club florida. jackalone said he was concerned the state would continue to cut environmental rules enforcement and to take from earmarked funds intended for the environment to spend on other government programs. state representative carlos smith, a democrat who represents a central florida district seeing an influx of residents fleeing from hurricane-battered areas, including puerto rico, said he opposed scott’s budget proposal on affordable housing. under the plan, overall spending on affordable housing would rise, smith said, but it would also include a raid of nearly $92 million on trust funds earmarked for affordable homes. “we don’t know what to do, people are sleeping in cars,” smith said of storm evacuees, namely puerto ricans fleeing the bankrupt and hurricane-battered u.s. commonwealth.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.655000000000001,8.200000000000001,0.0,0.0

[video],"what not to do is pretty much everything this nutjob did:1. do not angrily confront anyone with children in tow franklin claims to be terrified of these men and yet she aggressively confronts them and films them while hurling insults at them. she thinks they are racists and people who support hate symbols, which leads one to believe she also thinks they are capable of great violence. would you provoke violent racists while you have your children with you? i wouldn t. so either she s incredibly stupid or she knows these men aren t dangerous at all and what she is doing is meant to intimidate and shame them. (let s also acknowledge that it can t possibly be good for children to hear their mother sobbing and freaking out while she does absolutely nothing to reassure them. it s hard to watch.)2. don t lie about things that are verifiably untrue when faking a hate hoax, make sure you edit out the parts of the video that prove you re a liar. she lied about several things. first, she lied about the confederate flags hanging on the wall. you ll notice that in the video you can t see any flags. that s because there weren t any on the wall like franklin claimed. she might have gotten away with it if she hadn t taken a picture of the flags and posted them on her facebook page for anyone to see. here is the flag she claims was displayed on the wall: it it not a flag and it is not hanging on the wall. it s a rug that is hanging in a rug rack with other rugs and it s buried in the middle where she would have had to dig through them to find it. then she lied about what the men said to her. we can clearly hear the man call her a bit*h. but when she describes what happens to her to a bystander, she decides to make it sound worse by saying he called her a f***ing bit*h. she also adds that they followed her around, which also doesn t appear true when watching the video she made.then she lies about the man in the parking lot approaching her! clearly, the man is filming her from about 50 feet away while standing absolutely still. he only moves once when she dares him not to come any closer and sarcastically takes one giant step forward like he s playing simon says. it s hilarious. this triggers the next mentally unstable reaction from the sjw.3. if you can t muster real tears, don t bother her out-of-control response and fake crying are razzie-worthy. she s so terrified and scared for her life that she remembers to turn the camera around so we can all see her dry cheeks as she wails uncontrollably at an ear-splitting frequency. then, when a good samaritan comes over to assist her, she continues her bad acting and fake sobbing while her nose grows on camera as she starts recounting a bunch of stuff that didn t happen, proving once again that sjws always lie.via: pjmedia",1,16,0.0,1,1,0,0.0,11.3,16.400000000000002,0.0,0.0
trump executive order on ethics commitments bans lobbying for executive branch employees,"21st century wire says reactions around the world are mixed with regards to the first salvo of executive orders coming out of the trump white house, but here s one that will likely have many readers nodding in agreement even some reluctant agreement from the left, perhaps?on january 28th, president trump signed the executive order on ethics commitments by executive branch appointees. will this executive order have some of the dc swamp life scrambling to tune up the ethics associated with political appointees and lobbying on capital hill? has president trump just put some gravitas behind his campaign promises to drain the swamp ?time will tell, but this could be a step in the right direction in curtailing some of the power that lobbyists can wield.rt has more in the report below: rtas part of his promise to drain the swamp us president donald trump has signed an ethics commitments executive order restricting his administration officials from working as lobbyists after they leave government.the order bans his appointees from lobbying any government official for two years and the agency they worked in for five years. it also prevents them from ever lobbying the us on behalf of a foreign government or foreign political parties.the order is solely enforceable by the united states by any legally available means. anyone found violating the ban could be barred from lobbying their former agency for up to another five years, on top of the five-year period covered by the order.the order also states that trump, or his designee, may also grant to any person a waiver of any of restrictions contained in the pledge. a huge focus of trump s election campaign was his promise to tackle washington insiders. his pledge to drain the swamp became a hugely popular chant at his rallies. the executive order is an effort to deliver on those promises however it s far from certain that it will be effective.it s already common for former officials to find ways to use their influence without registering as lobbyists. under the lobbying disclosure act, former officials can avoid registering as lobbyists if they spend less than 20 percent of their time in meetings with government officials continue this report at rtread more trump news at: 21st century wire trump filessupport our work by subscribing & becoming a member @21wire.tv",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.656666666666666,21.46666666666667,0.0,0.0
watch: trump campaign manager crashes and burns when grilled about immigration plan,"abc host martha raddatz proved once again why she is one of the best choices to be a presidential debate moderator on sunday, when she grilled kellyanne conway about the republican nominee s immigration plan.after trump s campaign manager talked about how hillary clinton and tim kaine supposedly don t answer questions correctly because they make it about trump and are not forthcoming, raddatz asked conway to clear up some questions about trump s plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, which she proceeded to answer by not really answering it. he said that the priority will be criminals and those who have overstayed their visas. that still amounts to between 5 million and 6.5 million people that he says will be quickly removed. the cost estimate for that is between $51 billion and $67 billion. how will he manage such a massive operation and who will pay for it? conway replied by putting the onus on ice officers and once again said trump will build a wall and force mexico to pay for it, completely avoiding answering for how trump intends to pay for such a costly plan. he ll manage it the way it should have been managed all along, by enforcing the law and relying upon those law enforcement officers and those ice officers to do their job, conway said. they ve been completely hamstrung in their ability to do their job. he also has said that he will triple the number of ice agents to try to help. conway then did exactly what she whined about kaine and clinton supposedly doing by pivoting to talking about how they don t have an immigration plan.except hillary clinton does have an immigration plan and you can find it on her website here.raddatz then steered conway back to trump s plan. back to immigration, he said there will be no amnesty; all immigrants here illegally will be subject to deportation, raddatz said. so will they be subject to deportation and removal? this is where conway really began to wither because republican logic dictates that all undocumented immigrants are criminals, which means all 11 million would have to be deported. but conway tried to have it both ways. if they re criminals, they re going immediately. and we don t know what that number is. we hear anything from 1 million to 2 million, conway replied. and then, of course, he has also said, this being the most generous country to immigrants in the world, that if you want to come to america and immigrate here legally raddatz s bullshit detector went off and she once again tried to pin conway to the wall by asking her point blank that if these immigrants have not committed a crime in the united states will trump still deport them. well, conway couldn t handle that question either. he has said that you should stand in line and immigrate legally, conway said before raddatz cut her off again. so you mean they have to go? raddatz asked.conway once again could not handle the question and made a series of gaffes in response. she once again falsely claimed that hillary clinton does not have an immigration plan while trump has a ten-point plan. for the record, hillary s plan is a nine-point plan and it is posted on her campaign website.conway also said that trump plans to rescind all those executive amnesties. so does that mean trump will rescind any executive order that has ever granted amnesty to immigrants, including those issued by presidents that came before president obama? because that would be very worrying if that s the case as trump s immigration plan could then affect millions and millions more people.raddatz finally realized that conway was not going to be forthcoming in her answers and proceeded to slam her for it.here s the video via youtube.this is why martha raddatz is considered one of the toughest interviewers in the media. she took conway to the cleaners and made her look like the hypocrite and fool that she is. donald trump s plan would be costly, not to mention an international incident between mexico and the united states since you have to wonder how trump will actually force mexico to pay for something it has repeatedly refused to pay for.and the fact that conway is literally lying about hillary clinton by claiming that she doesn t have a plan is equally infuriating. if there s one claim raddatz should have challenged conway on it s that one. other than that, conway crashed and burned because raddatz is a pro, which should be making trump very nervous since he will have to face her later this year when she moderates a debate.featured image via screen capture",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.756666666666668,8.133333333333335,0.0,0.0
trump says violence by anti-fascists proves him right on charlottesville,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump on thursday stood by his belief that both sides were to blame for violence in charlottesville, virginia, between white supremacists and counterprotesters last month. trump had drawn criticism for not initially condemning white supremacists who organized the event on aug. 12, with even some of his fellow republicans expressing dismay at his opinion. trump spoke to reporters aboard air force one a day after a meeting with south carolina republican senator tim scott, an african-american who had expressed concern about trump’s comments. “we had a great talk yesterday,” he said of his meeting with scott. “i think especially in the light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what’s going on there. you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. and essentially that’s what i said.” trump said anti-fascist groups known as the “antifa” must share blame for neo-nazis and the ku klux klan fighting with anti-racism protesters in the streets. one woman was killed when a suspected white nationalist crashed his car into demonstrators. on thursday, the president also signed a resolution sent to him by congress that condemned the violence in charlottesville and opposed “hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms.” “no matter the color of our skin or our ethnic heritage, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty god,” trump said in a statement regarding the resolution. in berkeley, california, violence erupted on aug. 27 when a small group of masked antifa and left-wing protestors attacked right-wing demonstrators. “now, because of what’s happened since then with antifa, you look at really what’s happened since charlottesville. a lot of people are saying, in fact a lot of people have actually written, ‘gee, trump might have a point,’” he said.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.08333333333333333,7.190000000000001,16.0,0.0,0.0

"canadian pm justin trudeau explains why he keeps saying, “i’m a feminist”","during a united nations summit in new york city today focusing on women, canadian prime minister justin trudeau explained why he is going to keep saying he is a feminist. i m going to keep saying loudly and clearly that i am a feminist, until it is met with a shrug, said trudeau. why does every time i say i m a feminist, the twitterverse explodes and news medias pick it up. it shouldn t be something that creates a reaction. it simply is saying, i believe in the equality of men and women and i believe that we still have an awful lot of work to do to get there. trudeau added, it s just really, really obvious that we should be standing up for women s rights and trying to create more equal societies. like, duh. trudeau won election in october 2015 after a stunning comeback from third in the polls. he famously appointed an equal number of men and women in his cabinet, and cited his reasoning for doing so, because it s 2015. during the summit, he called on world leaders to follow canada s lead when appointing their own cabinets. any world leaders who tell me i d love to, i just can t do that with the current configuration of our parliament or of my party , i say: well, what are you doing to change that configuration and draw out those extraordinary women who can be leaders that we need? , he told the crowd.his party, the liberal party, also recouped a majority in the canadian parliament. his election also inspired an increase of voter turnout by 7.4 percent to 68.5 percent. trudeau won election on a campaign platform of progressive reforms, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy and dramatically improving infrastructure. trudeau has also given warm welcomes to syrian refugees arriving in canada to seek asylum.just last week, trudeau met with president barack obama to promote ties between canada and the united states, and to announce joint efforts to combat climate change. trudeau s predecessor, stephen harper, as an aggressive proponent for the oil industry and did not share the same values in fighting climate change trudeau and obama do. featured image courtesy of flickr",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.125,10.723333333333333,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0
latest fire in chinese capital kills five despite safety blitz,"beijing (reuters) - a fire in a southern neighbourhood of beijing early on wednesday killed five people, the chinese government said, just weeks after another deadly blaze in the city prompted a crackdown against migrant workers sparking widespread anger. the fire in a house in baiqiangzi, a migrant village in the chinese capital, was caused by two electric bikes, a fireman who gave his family name as qiu told reuters at the scene. eight people were injured and had been taken to hospital, the government said. police detained the house owner who had rented it out, state news agency xinhua said. a resident in his 30s, who declined to be identified, said he was in the building when the fire broke out just before 1 a.m. (1700 gmt tuesday). he said that the room where electric bikes are charged was full of flames. he helped carry people out, some of whom were burnt from head to toe , he said. it was terrifying but i had to help, he told reuters. fireman qiu said the cause was still being investigated. the fire itself was not very big but the plastic material on the outside of the ebikes created lots of poisonous smoke that led to deaths, qiu said. beijing s municipal government launched a 40-day special operation targeting fire code and building safety violations last month after a nov. 18 apartment fire in another southern part of the city killed 19 people, almost all of them migrants. the city-wide fire safety blitz has forced thousands of migrant workers out of their homes and businesses, igniting unusually direct criticism of city government measures seen by some people as unfairly targeting the vulnerable underclass. beijing s communist party chief cai qi has visited migrant workers in an apparent effort to address those concerns, telling them the city cannot do without their hard work, the official beijing daily said on wednesday. our city needs sanitation, cleaning, security, logistics, housekeeping, courier, catering and other ordinary workers, the paper quoted cai as saying. whether in city operations or normal daily life, we can t do without them. companies in all sectors in beijing rely on migrant workers and they have used their sweat to contribute to the city s development, cai said. we need to give these workers full respect and show even more care and love for them, work hard to address their hardships and anxieties, to give them a sense of belonging, he said. xinhua said cai had visited the site of the latest fire and also been to see the survivors in hospital. the government has come under increasing pressure in the wake of the crackdown on migrant workers, including sporadic protests and an open letter from more than 100 prominent academics, lawyers and intellectuals denouncing the steps. such open criticism of government is increasingly rare as officials have clamped down on various aspects of civil society under president xi jinping. some non-profit groups that sought to offer assistance said they had been obstructed by police, with their online advertisements blocked by censors.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,4.0,0.0,0.0

obama’s secret gift to the american people could save our democracy (details),"in light of the russian hacking scandal that interfered in our nation s election, it seemed to many that the obama administration was taking it lying down. it wasn t, at least according to a ground breaking report by the new york times that says that in his final days, the president worked to create a trail leading directly from russia to donald trump.in the obama administration s last days, some white house officials scrambled to spread information about russian efforts to undermine the presidential election and about possible contacts between associates of president-elect donald j. trump and russians across the government. former american officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn t duplicated in future american or european elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.intelligence officials had suspected something fishy as early as last summer, but the evidence was still too weak. in september, though, there was a series of cyber attacks on state voting systems. that s when the administration became more vocal on the matter. that s also when obama s intelligence departments got very serious.but it wasn t until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign was to help tip the election in mr. trump s favor. in early december, mr. obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the russian campaign.in the weeks before the assessment was released in january, the intelligence community combed through databases for an array of communications and other information some of which was months old by then and began producing reports that showed there were contacts during the campaign between trump associates and russian officials.while we still don t know exactly what the obama administration knows, we do know that there are more than a handful of trump officials, including his attorney general, who have confirmed contacts with russian oligarchs, spies and government officials. that s unprecedented.congress is also taking this very seriously. the house intelligence committee is about to investigate. we have reached a written agreement, the minority and the majority in the house intelligence committee, that we will investigate allegations of russian collusion with the trump campaign, democratic representative adam schiff said on msnbc.u.s. intelligence analysts have concluded that russia tried to help trump win the white house by discrediting democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton and her party through cyber attacks. president barack obama, a democrat, expelled russian diplomats in retaliation in december.the trump administration, of course, continues to deny any involvement with the putin administration, but it s become quite clear that without russia, we d have a president hillary clinton. russia also denies any connection, but they re also distancing themselves from the now toxic trump. once they re done protecting him, he s done.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.06666666666666667,11.706666666666667,8.133333333333335,0.0,0.0

wisconsin to consider $3 billion foxconn incentive package,"washington (reuters) - the wisconsin governor ordered the state legislature back into special session on tuesday to consider an incentive package that would award taiwanese electronics manufacturer foxconn $3 billion over 15 years in mostly cash incentives and waive several state environmental reviews. foxconn said last week in a white house ceremony it plans to build a $10 billion lcd flat screen factory in southeast wisconsin. the company, formally known as hon hai precision industry co ltd (2317.tw), hopes to open the 20 million-square-foot plant in 2020 at a 1,000-acre site and will initially employ 3,000 people. republican governor scott walker and foxconn said the company ultimately may employ 13,000 people at the site. the draft bill released monday discloses new details of the expensive incentive package that wisconsin offered as it competed with six other states to land the project that it says will also generate 22,000 ancillary jobs and 10,000 construction jobs. the republican-controlled legislature will take up the measure on tuesday but it is not clear when they will vote. if the incentives are approved, the wisconsin economic development corporation would then negotiate a formal contract with foxconn on the project, said mark maley, a spokesman for wedc. tim bartik, an economist at the upjohn institute for employment research in michigan who studies government tax incentives, said the foxconn package is at least six times the average u.s. award but similar to some deals for auto plants and planemaker boeing co (ba.n). foxconn is a major supplier to apple inc (aapl.o) for its iphones but the company has not said if the wisconsin factory would produce any parts for apple. under the legislation, foxconn can receive up to $200 million per year in refundable tax credits, capped at $2.85 billion if meets capital and employment compensation targets. it can also avoid paying $150 million in sales taxes on building materials, equipment and supplies. although the state measures to attract foxconn are labeled tax incentives, they largely would be paid in cash since the effective wisconsin state tax rate is 0.4 percent on manufacturers. in addition to incentives, president donald trump suggested the investment decision was due to his election and promised changes in corporate regulatory and tax policy. the incentives include up to $1.5 billion in state income tax credits for job creation and up to $1.35 billion in state income tax credits for capital investment. foxconn is eligible for additional local incentives. the company is eligible for refundable tax credits equal to 17 percent of wages paid instead of the typical 7 percent and 15 percent of capital costs instead of 10 percent. wisconsin also agreed in the draft legislation to issue up to $252.4 million in state debt to reconstruct parts of interstate 94 near the sites that the company is considering sites in kenosha and racine counties near the border with illinois. the draft legislation released by walker waives a required state environmental impact statement and allows the company to discharge dredged or fill material into some wetlands without state permits. the legislation also would allow foxconn to connect artificial bodies of water with natural waterways without state permits. foxconn chairman terry gou told the milwaukee journal sentinel that one reason wisconsin was appealing is because of its proximity to abundant fresh water from lake michigan needed to build panels. the legislation also waives requiring approval for the project by the public service commission, which oversees power and water utilities in wisconsin.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.605000000000004,18.2,0.0,0.0

"abroad in america, deciphering the 2016 presidential race - the new york times","the last election i covered didn’t work out so well for me. it was may 2013, and i was in pakistan. as i was returning from a polling station in the southern city of lahore, military intelligence officials flagged down my car. hours later i was on a plane out of the country, having been deported. elections are a fraught business in many parts of the world. in many of those countries, the american way of choosing a president seems ideal, however imperfect. the electoral machine resembles a classic, limousine: large, showy and expensive, yet robust and broadly predictable. this year’s race, at the outset, looked set to follow in that vein as a contest between the scions of two storied political dynasties, hillary clinton and jeb bush. then the upstart billionaire and reality tv star donald j. trump thrust himself into the fray, shredding the script, dismissing mr. bush and upending most notions of what is possible, or acceptable, in an american political contest. i have come from my regular base in cairo to the united states to help with the new york times’s coverage of the 2016 campaign. you might wonder what i can add, given that i’m irish and my american colleagues are already producing a stream of illuminating and incisive stories. i hope to supplement that coverage with reporting that responds to the queries of our international readers, and approaches the election — in all its drama, significance and absurdity — in much the same way as we would events abroad. the series will be called abroad in america. this feverish political season has transfixed the world outside america, too. the election’s first act — the primary contests, when the two main parties select their ultimate candidates — attracts an unusual degree of international scrutiny. violence at rallies, incendiary speeches, race baiting, attacks on journalists and judges, proposals to bar muslims or mexicans — the primaries signaled a sudden sea change that left watching with fascination, puzzlement and a profound sense of trepidation. for some countries, the changes resonate strongly at home. mr. trump’s success chimes with nationalist surges across europe and the “brexit” vote. disillusionment with traditional elites, hostility toward immigrants and anger among the losers from globalization — all resonate elsewhere. yet it is odd and disturbing to hear terms like fascism and demagogy, most frequently associated with the european fringe or rickety governments, being used in the context of an american campaign. mrs. clinton’s campaign is haunted by the high levels of hostility even among many voters on the left. and so the election, which starts in earnest in the coming weeks, is shaping up as a close unpopularity contest: in the latest polls, mr. trump and mrs. clinton both have 40 percent support. but it is not just about the winner in november. the process has thrown up urgent new questions — about race, guns and the global economy, among others — as well as anguished soul searching about the very process of selecting a president. where will the politics of resentment and anger ultimately lead? does the united states suffer, as one writer suggested, from too much democracy? could this be an “ event” for representative government? my reporting will focus more at ground level. some of my efforts will be explanatory — unraveling the intricacies and curiosities like the electoral college, a source of befuddlement to many foreigners (and some americans). more broadly, though, i hope to turn my focus as a foreign correspondent to deciphering the fears, hopes and motivations that are driving voters of every hue, and will determine the most powerful leader on the planet. my journey will also be driven by you, the readers. i’ll be posting on twitter and instagram, and soliciting your questions and concerns. what infuriates, intrigues or mystifies you about the elections? i’ll be starting the journey on monday at the republican national convention in cleveland. please join me on the way.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.723333333333333,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0
here's why moderate republicans aren't running for congress anymore,"hey, you! any interest in running for the us house or, maybe better, the us senate? a few seats are up for grabs in 2016. it's a very powerful, prestigious, decently well-paying job. lots of important decisions. great on a résumé. what's that you say? not interested. not for you? yeah, i get it. i wouldn't want to run for congress either. i know, you're probably a reasonable person, a nuanced thinker with a bit of an independent streak. you don't want to get drawn into the maw of that tribal trench warfare down there on the dc swamp. it's a bitter, angry place. and no fun. but hey, somebody has to do the job. and, flippant tone aside, it really matters who does do the job. if reasonable, level-headed people like you don't want to run for congress, that means only hair-on-fire ideologues will put run the place, and ... oh wait. that does seem to be happening a bit these days. which takes us to that upcoming 2016 congressional election. yet another golden opportunity to bring some fresh talent into washington, maybe for some folks who are more excited about governing than about trying to make government disappear altogether? if such optimism sounds like the triumph of hope over experience, it probably is. which raises an important question: why don't we get many moderates, especially moderate republicans, running for office these days? i've gathered here two good explanations from some recent political science literature: say you're a moderate republican. you might look at the republican party in congress and feel like it's not exactly your people in charge of the place. you'd see that the leaders in congress tend to be on the extremist side, and you'd make a reasonable guess that you wouldn't get too far in congress as a moderate. by contrast, if you're a true conservative, you'd see an opportunity to fit right in. this is the ""party fit hypothesis,"" as developed by political scientist danielle thomsen in a paper titled ""ideological moderates won't run: how party fit matters for partisan polarization in congress."" (she also has a forthcoming book on this.) thomsen looked at some surveys of state legislators and some data on who actually runs for congress. her conclusion based on the data is simple: ""the more liberal the republican state legislator, the less likely she is to run for congress; the more conservative the democratic state legislator, the less likely she is to do so."" in an email, thomsen told me that there are indeed moderates in the state legislatures. she estimates that ""about 20% of republican state legislators are as liberal as former senator olympia snowe (r-me) and nearly 30% of democratic state legislators are as conservative as former representative john tanner (d-tn)."" it's just that they are much less likely to run for congress. like most aspects of polarization, the ""party fit"" story is asymmetrical — the polarizing impact is much stronger for republicans. democrats have maintained more ideological diversity and get more moderates to run. this is not true for republicans. and like most aspects of polarization, it feeds on itself. as thomsen also wrote in her email to me, "" as moderates gradually lost their place in both parties, polarization has become self-reinforcing. the hyper-partisanship in congress has discouraged moderates from running for and remaining in congress, which has further exacerbated the ideological distance between the parties."" again, say you're a moderate republican. chances are your local and state party leaders are not all that interested in encouraging you to run. most likely, they are ideologues themselves, and they'd like to find people who share their beliefs, especially if they are republicans. they want true conservatives. this is a conclusion i draw from a fascinating survey of 6,000 county-level political party leaders, conducted by political scientists david broockman, nicholas carnes, melody crowder-meyer, and christopher skovron. they asked what qualities party leaders wanted. sure, the party leaders said they looked for the usual things — honesty, experience intelligence, dedication, good looks, and, yes, ability to raise money. but they also cared about ideology — particularly the republicans. broockman et al. write: and party leaders do play a very important role in candidate recruitment, as broockman documented in a separate paper: in pretty much every study trying to explain why candidates decided to run for office, recruitment was a major factor. again, we have a self-reinforcing loop here: the more ideologues run the party, the more they are going to recruit other like-minded candidates to run for office. there is also probably a fundraising aspect to this. most of the big donors tend to be pretty ideological (again, especially on the right). if they give a lot of money, it's almost always because they feel very strongly that one or the other of the two major parties needs to be in charge. active passion and strong partisanship tend to go together. for example, in explaining ""leapfrog representation"" (the phenomenon of extremist candidates jumping over the median voter in a district when a seat changes partisan control), political scientists joseph bafumi and michael c. herron point that active donors tend to be more extreme than non-donors. they argue that this may offer one explanation why candidates do not converge on the middle — if you can't raise money from (ideological) donors, it's harder to run for office. sure, you might argue, party leaders may be ideologues themselves, especially on the right. but most of all, they want to stay in power. and to stay in power, they need to win elections. and to win elections, they need to converge on the median voter who is, by definition, in the middle of the left-right ideological distribution. ergo, the moderating pressures of electoral competition should overcome these forces of extremism. fair enough. in close races, party leaders may indeed face a trade-off between ideology and electability. but one problem is there just aren't that many close races. by the latest cook political report 2016 projections, 378 out of 435 house seats are considered safe — that's 87 percent. add in the 25 ""likely"" seats, and we're at 403 out of 435, or 93 percent, at low or no risk. so it doesn't matter whether parties pick moderates or ideologues — they're almost certainly going to win as long as they don't pick a convicted felon (or maybe even if they do). in the senate, 19 or 33 seats up in 2016 are solid for one party or another by the cook assessment. if we add in the likely seats, we're at 25 or 33, or 75 percent low or no risk. in state legislatures, meanwhile, 43 percent of seats are not even contested. in other words, the proposed moderation of the median voter theory doesn't have very many seats on which to work its supposed magic. but then again, it's not even clear that competitive elections actually bring candidates to the middle. research by political scientists anthony fowler and andrew b. hall suggests that partisans who win in close congressional elections vote just as extreme as partisans who win by landslides. fowler and hall conclude, ""elected officials do not adapt their roll-call voting to their districts' preferences over time, and ... voters do not systematically respond by replacing incumbents."" no wonder, then, that political scientists jacob hacker and paul pierson have described the median voter theory as a failure in a recent paper criticizing the ""downsian"" paradigm (anthony downs popularized the median voter theory). as hacker and pierson conclude, ""parties not only fail to converge, they diverge asymmetrically."" one key reason for this, they argue, is that organized interests within the parties make strong demands, and ""party leaders will be attentive to such demands because groups can provide resources they need, offering critical financial and organizational support."" okay, so you're probably not going to run for congress in 2016. nor am i. but somebody out there is going to put up with all the endless fundraising calls and the invasions of privacy and the negative ads attacking them and the endless recitation of the same platitudinous speeches over and over again. and, especially on the right, that somebody is probably going to be an ideologue. because who else wants to run these days? and who else do party leaders want to recruit? the obvious suggestion is that we need to get some different people running for national office — again, especially on the right. more broadly, we might want to think a little more about the pipeline of who's getting involved in politics at all. and yeah, we probably also ought to do something about this problem of only a tiny share of the millennial generation viewing politics as a worthwhile career. but there's plenty of time ahead to work through these problems. so watch this space for some ideas in the months ahead. i'm going to be thinking a bit about this problem. this post is part of polyarchy, an independent blog produced by the political reform program at new america, a washington think tank devoted to developing new

germany's merkel backs tighter refugee rules amid sex assault protests,"as demonstrations erupted in cologne on saturday over new year's eve sexual assaults and robberies blamed largely on foreigners, chancellor angela merkel called for stricter laws regulating asylum seekers. merkel, who has been particularly outspoken in welcoming refugees to germany, told a two-day meeting of the christian democrats in mainz that tighter restrictions would be ""in the interest of citizens, but also in the interests of the great majority of the refugees who are here,” deutsche presse-agentur reported. ""when crimes are committed, and people place themselves outside the law ... there must be consequences,"" she told reporters after the meeting, the bbc reported. party leaders agreed on a proposal to strengthen the ability of police to conduct checks of identity papers, and also to exclude foreigners from being granted asylum who had been convicted of crimes and sentenced to terms even as light as probation. the measures would require approval by parliament. the sharper tone follows reports in cologne that some 1,000 men — many intoxicated — robbed, sexually assaulted and in some cases raped women during celebrations on new year's eve. ""refugees, asylum seekers, migrants, foreigners, friendly or evil, new or long-time residents: it doesn't matter,"" the newsmagazine der spiegel said in an editorial. ""it seems as though the time has come for a broad debate over germany's future — and merkel's mantra 'we can do it,' is no longer enough to suppress it."" police initially identified the suspects as up to 1,000 men ""of middle eastern origin,” but later backtracked as public officials cautioned there was little information on whether those involved were migrants. of the 32 suspects identified by police in cologne, 22 are asylum seekers, the german interior ministry said. one suspect was carrying a document with arabic-german translations of sexist phrases and threats, which mass-circulation tabloid bild published on saturday. as the uproar over the assaults gathered strength, thousands of demonstrators, from the left and right, turned out in cologne for a day of protests saturday. the protesters included the anti-islamic pegida movement and the right-wing extremist pro cologne party. at one point, police fired tear gas and used water cannon to break up a pegida rally after protesters threw firecrackers and bottles at officers, agence france-presse reported. one group carried signs saying, ""no violence against women."" another banner read, ""migrants out."" demonstrators from the political left chanted, ""say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here,"" buzzfeed reported. some 1,700 police, many in riot gear, were on hand to control the crowds, the dpa news agency reported.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.73,12.0,0.0,0.0
"trump administration drafts plan to raise asylum bar, speed deportations","washington (reuters) - the department of homeland security has prepared new guidance for immigration agents aimed at speeding up deportations by denying asylum claims earlier in the process. the new guidelines, contained in a draft memo dated february 17 but not yet sent to field offices, directs agents to only pass applicants who have a good chance of ultimately getting asylum, but does not give specific criteria for establishing credible fear of persecution if sent home. the guidance instructs asylum officers to ""elicit all relevant information"" in determining whether an applicant has ""credible fear"" of persecution if returned home, the first obstacle faced by migrants on the u.s.-mexico border requesting asylum. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2m4apas) three sources familiar with the drafting of the guidance said the goal of the new instructions is to raise the bar on initial screening in order to ease strain on the courts and reduce the number of immigrants allowed to stay in the united states, often for years, while they await a hearing. the administration’s plan is to leave wide discretion to asylum officers by allowing them to determine which applications have a “significant possibility” of being approved by an immigration court, the sources said. the guidance was first reported and posted on the internet by mcclatchy news organization. in 2015, just 18 percent of asylum applicants whose cases were ruled on by immigration judges were granted asylum, according to the justice department. applicants from countries with a high rate of political persecution have a higher chance of winning their asylum cases. a tougher approach to asylum seekers would be an element of president donald trump’s promise to crack down on immigration and tighten border security, a cornerstone of his election campaign and a top priority of his first month in office. the guidelines are contained in two draft memos signed by homeland security secretary john kelly and currently under review by the white house, according to two people familiar with them. the memos also outlined plans for greatly expanding the categories of people that immigration agents target for deportation, and gives them wide discretion in deciding who to deport. previously, recent arrivals and convicted criminals were the prime targets. the new plan would include migrants who have been charged but not convicted of crimes, and would also apply to illegal immigrants who have been in the country for many years. the memos also call for quickly hiring 10,000 more immigration and customs enforcement agents as well as 5,000 more border patrol agents. the dhs declined to comment for this story, referring questions to the white house, which did not respond to a request for comment. under the immigration and nationality act, an applicant must generally demonstrate “a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” immigration lawyers say any applicants who appear to meet that criteria in their initial interviews should be allowed to make their cases in court. they oppose encouraging asylum officers to take a stricter stance on questioning claims and rejecting applications. interviews to assess credible fear are conducted almost immediately after an asylum request is made, often at the border or in detention facilities by immigration agents or asylum officers, and most applicants easily clear that hurdle. between july and september of 2016, u.s. asylum officers accepted nearly 88 percent of the claims of credible fear, according to u.s. citizenship and immigration services data. asylum seekers who fail the credible fear test can be quickly deported unless they file an appeal. currently, those who pass the test are eventually released and allowed to remain in the united states awaiting hearings, which are often scheduled years into the future because of a backlog of more than 500,000 cases in immigration courts. between october 2015 and april 2016, nearly 50,000 migrants claimed credible fear, 78 percent of whom were from honduras, el salvador, guatemala or mexico, according to statistics from uscis. the number of migrants from those three countries who passed credible fear and went to court to make their case for asylum rose sharply between 2011 and 2015, from 13,970 claims to 34,125, according to data from the justice department. former border patrol chief mike fisher credits that trend to advice from immigration lawyers who know “asylum officers are going to err on the side of caution and refer most cases to a judge.” the new guidance on asylum seekers is for border personnel implementing trump’s jan. 25 executive order on tightening u.s. border security. among other measures, the president’s directive calls for expediting eligibility claims of those attempting to stay in the united states and promptly deporting those whose claims are rejected. some immigration officers familiar with the draft guidance say they are concerned that a rapid increase in deportations of asylum seekers could strain overcrowded detention facilities and create transportation problems. deportations take time and coordination, even when immigrants are quickly targeted for expulsion. u.s. officials must get approval from a deportee’s home country before repatriation can take place, and transportation can be complicated and expensive. immigrants from non-contiguous countries are flown home by plane, while mexicans are often bused across the border. homeland security personnel who worked on the guidance say they hope to expand detention space by at least 8,000 beds. the money to pay for that would require congressional sign-off. the extra beds, they say, would further the president’s goal, expressed in his executive order on border security, of ending the practice known as “catch and release” in which migrants, including asylum seekers, are freed pending a court hearing. the new guidance calls for expanding detention, but acknowledges that ending the practice “may not be immediately possible.” a congressional aide familiar with the administration’s plans said dhs is considering expanding its contracts with private prison companies like geo group (geo.n) and corecivic (cxw.n), which currently hold most immigrant detainees. immigrants rights advocates say they fear that raising the bar on the credible fear test could screen out migrants with a rightful claim to asylum, because asylum officers may dismiss cases that could make it through court if the asylum seeker were given legal counsel, said marielena hincapie, executive director of the national immigration law center. asylum applicants have the right to appeal denials of credible fear claims and may request to see a judge to assert their claim to be in the united states for other reasons, such as family ties. for that reason, raising the bar on credible fear might not deter asylum seekers as much as the trump administration hopes, said former border patrol head

hillary steals the presidency while atlas shrugs,"financial markets , gold , market manipulation , u.s. economy banana republic , clinton foundation , hillary emails , podesta emails , the rapture admin must have been some kind of time/space warp while we slept last night… today obama says if illegals vote they become a citizen and the ny post headline is the filipino maid who printed hillary’s classified emails then comey bails on 650,000 damning emails. f#%k me dave, i feel like i’m on lsd. – email from a reader about 12 years ago i was chatting with the friend who dragged me feet-first into the “dark side” and the world of precious metals in 2001. we were discussing eastman kodak’s likely demise a few years before the company went into the tank. we knew a 2008-type event was going to happen at some point. at the time, we said that eventually we would see events occur in this country that would blow our minds. mind you, this was a couple years after enron, 9/11 (which we knew was a government false-flag operation), bernie madoff and the u.s.’ illegal invasion based on admitted (eventually) lies propagated by colin powell. i have to say, the way in which hillary clinton’s criminal organization has gained complete control over the political and justice system and the media in this country is truly mind-blowing. hillary is a criminally insane sociopath. that point is unequivocally inarguable. but the true devil in her organization is john podesta, who’s persona has been made available to anyone willing to spend time reading just a portion of the “podesta” emails given to us by wikileaks. there are 691,200 seconds in 8 days. fbi director comey reviewed 650,000 emails in 8 days? an email per second? americans aren’t stupid! – tweet from bernard kerik, ex-nypd commissioner if anyone knows about corrupt organizations, it’s an nypd commissioner – the nypd being one of the most internally corrupt law enforcement organizations around. it’s great when ex-insiders blow the whistle on others when the agenda of those others do not fit that of the ex-insider’s “team.” the manner in which jim comey has folded is beyond stunning. i’m not sure there’s anyone who cares about this matter who believes that comey was able to parse through over 650,000 emails in 8 days in order to determine that hillary did not commit “intent” in her email escapades. hillary’s email trail made available to the public is a fascinating trail of criminality. i doubt james patterson, john grisham and robert ludlum could combine resources and make up a crime tale as intriguing as hillary’s. the evidence piling up against hillary is breathtaking. according to the recently released podesta emails, the clinton foundation has been used for everything except funding charitable causes, including paying for chelsea’s wedding and funding chelsea’s husband’s failed hedge fund. if i were not able to laugh at this insanity, i’d be suicidal… i think most americans who are being honest with themselves are fully aware of the fact that hillary clinton is likely the most corrupt politician in u.s. history. if anything, the election of hillary clinton is a symptom that the end is near for the united states. i am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in american history, and if the american people willingly choose hillary clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation. the above quote is an excerpt from a must-read essay written by michael snyder: i just lost all faith in our deeply corrupt legal system… i urge everyone to read snyder’s commentary.",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.054285714285715,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0
kentucky man arrested in assault on senator rand paul released on bail,"louisville/washington (reuters) - a man has been arrested for assaulting u.s. senator rand paul at his kentucky home on friday and causing a “minor injury,” the state police said. rene boucher, 59, of bowling green, kentucky, was arrested and charged with one count of fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, the kentucky state police said in a statement on saturday. paul and boucher were acquaintances, said jeremy hodges, a state police spokesman, who declined to say what led to the incident. paul’s office said in a statement the former republican presidential candidate “was blindsided and the victim of an assault. the assailant was arrested, and it is now a matter for the police. senator paul is fine.” his office did not immediately respond to questions about the extent of any injuries the 54-year-old senator may have suffered or the circumstances of the incident. hodges said paul’s injuries were minor and did not require transport to a hospital. boucher was booked into the warren county regional jail. he was released on saturday after posting a $7,500 bond, captain chip olney of the facility said by phone. boucher is scheduled to appear in court on thursday, olney said. it was unclear if boucher has an attorney, and he could not be reached for comment late on saturday. paul, an ophthalmologist, dropped out of the race for president in february 2016 and successfully ran for re-election as a senator. in september, paul opposed a partial repeal of healthcare reforms adopted under former democratic president barack obama, angering president donald trump, a republican. paul last month played golf with trump and discussed tax reform proposals.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.756666666666668,14.8,0.0,0.0
"in a week, trump reshapes decades of perceptions about america - the new york times","washington — by some measures, president trump has altered the perception of american foreign policy more in the past seven days than his predecessors did in the past seven decades. a nation that built its brand around the world as open to the world’s needy and ambitious is now viewed, after mr. trump’s immigration executive order, as closing its doors in a way it never did even after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. twenty years of efforts to rebuild a relationship with mexico — on trade, counterterrorism and drug interdiction — crashed into an avoidable blowup with the mexican president, enrique peña nieto, who canceled his visit here. when prime minister theresa may of britain came for what appeared to be a largely successful visit, mr. trump’s first by the leader of a close ally, she spoke of maintaining sanctions on russia until it met its commitments on ukraine. mr. trump stayed silent. after he spoke the next day to president vladimir v. putin of russia, the official readout provided by the white house made no mention of ukraine, or of the operation to influence the american election that led president barack obama, in his last days in office, to issue new sanctions. perception is different from reality. it is possible that when viewed from a distance of a few years, mr. trump’s pronouncements about “extreme vetting” and his rush to push some of america’s most experienced career diplomats out of their jobs will look like a blitz intended to send a message to the world that he meant what he said when he talked about “america first. ” in a statement on sunday, mr. trump appeared to try to soften his action, arguing that “this is not a muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. ” he promised to “find ways to help all those who are suffering,” words that were missing on friday when he announced that all refugees from syria would be barred from entry to the united states, indefinitely. “it’s one week in,” robert m. gates, the former secretary of defense and c. i. a. director, said on abc’s “this week” on sunday. “every administration i’ve worked for begins with a flurry of executive orders” meant to distinguish itself from it predecessor. but mr. gates, who has served eight presidents, of both parties, quickly added that mr. trump risks accelerating a sense of an america that is pulling back and putting up walls, leaving a power vacuum around the globe. “that vacuum will not be filled by benign forces,” he said. two other prominent, establishment republicans, senators john mccain of arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina, called the lumping together in the immigration order of a major adversary, iran, with an ally, iraq, one of many reasons that the moves are “a wound in the fight against terrorism. ” mr. trump is hardly the first president to announce shifts in policy that surprised allies and upturned the existing order. president richard m. nixon’s decision to abandon the gold standard and to recognize china were shocks to the system. so was president george w. bush’s decision to invade iraq, though it was telegraphed for more than a year, as was mr. obama’s decision to strike a nuclear accord with iran and to reopen diplomatic relations with cuba. but in the case of mr. trump, there is a sense that the rush for change has superseded a study of unintended consequences. the ban on immigration and visitors from seven nations came with minimal, if any, input from the state department about the regional fallout — as did mr. trump’s declaration that he intends to move the american embassy in israel to jerusalem. the absence of advance thinking about how to deal with green card holders and iraqi interpreters who were promised entry to the united states in return for their service to american troops forced the white house to amend its interpretations of the order less than 48 hours after mr. trump signed it. it was all symptomatic of a new president eager to tweet first and work out details later. “this is policy by thunderbolt,” said joseph nye, a harvard professor who served as the head of the national intelligence council and has written extensively on how the united states can gain leverage from its “soft power” — the attractiveness of its culture and democracy. “you don’t want to tear up 70 years of foreign policy until you think hard about what replaces it. ” but inside the halls of the state department, where rex w. tillerson, the pick for secretary of state, has just begun to find his way around, there is definitely the sense among career diplomats that this is year zero. last week, the “landing team” of trump designees told several of the department’s most senior diplomats — career officials, some with decades of service — to clear out of their offices. almost all had submitted their resignations, the protocol when administrations changed, but had volunteered to stay on for a month or two until successors were appointed, to ensure that state department facilities were safe, american citizens were evacuated from perilous places and passports were issued. the trump team made it clear it had no interest in transitions. (mr. tillerson also never met with his predecessor, john kerry, before the inauguration.) it was not exactly a purge, but the fact remains that some of the government’s most experienced diplomats have moved on — including some of the women in the department. among them is anne patterson, 67, the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs and a former ambassador to pakistan and egypt, two of the biggest tinderboxes mr. trump will face. victoria j. nuland, 55, one of the department’s top russia experts and former ambassador to nato, who dealt with the ukraine crisis, decided to retire after concluding there was probably no place for her in mr. trump’s administration. such a housecleaning leaves open the question of whether mr. tillerson, who has extensive experience abroad as chief executive of exxon mobil but none as a diplomat, will have the kind of help he needs in a very different kind of enterprise than negotiating on behalf of the world’s largest oil company. in such an atmosphere, even seemingly routine moves — like the reorganization of the national security council — take on a political air. on sunday, mr. trump’s chief strategist, and chief ideologue, stephen k. bannon, was designated a permanent member of the “principals committee” of the national security council, putting a political aide on par with the secretaries of state and defense. meanwhile, the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff appeared to be downgraded, told to attend only when their issues were on the table. “this is stone cold crazy,” susan e. rice, the national security adviser until earlier this month, wrote in a twitter post. “who needs military advice or intell to make policy on isil, syria, afghanistan, dprk?” she said, using acronyms for the islamic state and north korea. mr. trump’s answer is simple: when you have come to upend the establishment, the establishment must vacate the premises.",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.412857142857145,8.457142857142857,0.0,0.0

elite nazi-allied order from hungary claims trump adviser sebastian gorka is sworn member,"lili bayer and larry cohler-esses haaretzsebastian gorka, president trump s top counter-terrorism adviser, is a formal member of a hungarian far-right group that is listed by the u.s. state department as having been under the direction of the nazi government of germany during world war ii, leaders of the organization have told the forward.the elite order, known as the vit zi rend, was established as a loyalist group by admiral miklos horthy, who ruled hungary as a staunch nationalist from 1920 to october 1944. a self-confessed anti-semite, horthy imposed restrictive jewish laws prior to world war ii and collaborated with hitler during the conflict. his cooperation with the nazi regime included the deportation of hundreds of thousands of jews into nazi hands. strange character: people are now questioning why trump hired bizarre hungarian author as his terrorism expert.gorka s membership in the organization if these vit zi rend leaders are correct, and if gorka did not disclose this when he entered the united states as an immigrant could have implications for his immigration status. the state department s foreign affairs manual specifies that members of the vit zi rend are presumed to be inadmissible to the country under the immigration and nationality act.gorka who vit zi rend leaders say took a lifelong oath of loyalty to their group did not respond to multiple emails sent to his work and personal accounts, asking whether he is a member of the vit zi rend and, if so, whether he disclosed this on his immigration application and on his application to be naturalized as a u.s. citizen in 2012. the white house also did not respond to a request for comment.continue this story at haaretzread more trump news at: 21st century wire trump filessupport our work by subscribing & becoming a member @21wire.tv",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.264615384615386,14.430769230769233,0.0,0.0
reading the news in times of empire,"dispatches from daniel espinosa working to defeat the big lie in all its forms in the manichean universe of us propaganda, the “bad guys” seem to be fond of killing children and bombing hospitals. having clearly identified the bad guys, the us, its allies and mainstream media ask patiently for a hesitant international community to act on its “responsibility to protect”. by now it would seem mainstream media are tired of calling for humanitarian intervention in eastern aleppo to stop the syrian arab army and russian jets, tired of trotting out statistics and quotes from the terrorist/rebel-infested white helmets (whs) and the opposition-supporting syrian observatory of human rights, a one-man operation located in a london suburb, while completely ignoring civilian victims of a rebel force said to be composed of 50% al-nusra (aka al qaeda terrorists. (1) confident of their media cover, the whs haven’t been smart enough to hide their ties with the notorious al-nusra and other terrorist factions and are now in danger of being fairly discredited. (2) at the same time, the sohr, probably designed as a short-term propaganda asset at a time when rebel/terrorist funding was still obscure and the world didn’t know it was actually al-nusra calling the shots in the ´moderate´ opposition side, is also losing credibility. but before the media is no longer able to sustain the lie even among their most uninformed victims, the chant of “the international community must act’ grows louder by the minute. but this time it’s not just client states, lapdog allies and some weak third world ‘regime’, subject to easy de-stabilization, otherwise it would be business as usual: subvert, demonize, invade, set up a facade regime and get ready for the next target. this time there’s russia to reckon with. and russia has her own independent reasons to be in syria, ground zero for world terrorism. gaddafi murdered by washington-controlled jihadists. a mafia hit pure and simple, ordered by the biggest mafia outfit on earth. uk’s daily mirror, a typical media shill for the imperialists, whitewashing the ugliness of what its masters did. in all these sanctimonious exercises favored by the western media, in reality little but a ministry of disinformation for global capitalism, we should notice the rigid script followed by the press, the lack of options when demanding interventions, as well as a complete lack of any kind of explanation of how their proposed intervention is supposed to take place, as if ‘humanitarian intervention’ meant some sort of magical way to end conflicts and save civilians, all of which shows their complete disregard for the recent past. many journalists—who by dint of sheer ignorance (they too are subject to the brainwash afflicting most americans, plus the pressures of careerism) are now lining up behind the ‘no-fly zone’ banner, some of them clearly not knowing exactly what it means, especially its sinister and extremely dangerous implications, but they know something better: power (and their paychecks) demand it (again). as it did in 2003 when the official initial pretext to rally the country for war, iraq´s weapons of mass destruction narrative, was losing steam, the people of iraq —according to our brave media—suddenly started to need ‘freedom’ and ‘protection’, to quote the usual doublespeak. needles to say the very same same powers which had ruthlessly imposed a brutal regime of sanctions that killed hundreds of thousands of children and women between 1991 and 2003, were now eager to deliver humanitarian aid. (3) t hose children passed unnoticed by our deeply concerned journalists while the tragedy of their slow-motion death was taking place; their pictures not used to call for any kind of humanitarian relief or intervention, as the corporate media attention to the suffering of civilians tends to be very selective, as ed herman and david peterson explain with typical lucidity in the politics of genocide: “when we ourselves commit mass-atrocity crimes, the atrocities are constructive , our victims are unworthy of our attention and indignation, and never suffer ‘genocide’ at our hands –like the iraqi untermenschen who have died in such grotesque numbers over the past two decades. but when the perpetrator of mass-atrocity crimes is our enemy or a state targeted by us for destabilization and attack, the converse is true. then the atrocities are nefarious and their victims worthy of our focus, sympathy, public displays of solidarity, and calls for inquiry and punishment”. eight years after iraq’s 2003 invasion, history repeated itself in libya, where another putative tyrant was ‘about to commit an atrocity against his own people’, as was suggested by european leaders and a deafening mainstream media chorus. eventually, the great hegemon, with headquarters in washington, also heard the call for action, and joined the crusade. (actually, the whole ruse had been plotted in close coordination in the true axis of evil of our time, the washington-london-paris triad of international gangsterism, with obama’s regime this time playing the coy, reluctant imperialist furnishing largely logistical and intel support). according to the british house of commons foreign affairs committee, which was “unable to visit tripoli, benghazi, tobruk or anywhere else in libya due to the collapse of internal security and the rule of law” in 2016, “…out of a total libyan population of 6.3 million people, 3 million people have been impacted by the armed conflict, and 2.4 million people require protection and some form of humanitarian assistance”. (4) for its part, the human rights watch stated, also in 2016, that “…forces engaged in the conflict continued with impunity to arbitrarily detain, torture, unlawfully kill, indiscriminately attack, abduct and disappear, and forcefully displace people from their homes. the domestic criminal justice system collapsed in most parts of the country, exacerbating the human rights crisis”. (5) this seems to be the paradoxical result of a recent ‘humanitarian intervention’ from which the mainstream media is not morally prepared to take any valuable lessons. of course, the paradox is nothing of the sort when you understand the real reasons behind the intervention, regarding the french government, and particularly its ex-president nicolas sarkozy, as stated by a us state department intelligence advisor: “a desire to gain a greater share of libya oil production; improve his internal political situation in france”, among other supposedly deeply humanitarian causes. the us state department, as expected, went along with the farce. b ut what is exactly a no-fly zone? according to us army general martin dempsey in a letter to the us congress in 2013: “this option uses lethal force to prevent the regime from using its military aircraft to bomb and resupply. it would extend air superiority over syria by neutralizing the regime’s advanced, defense integrated air defense system. it would also shoot down adversary aircraft and strike airfields, aircraft on the ground, and supporting infrastructure… risks include the loss of u.s. aircraft, which would require us to insert personnel recovery forces. it may also fail to reduce the violence…” and going back to the house of commons assessments of 2016, when “…france and uk argued that the international community should simply impose a no-fly zone… former us ambassador to nato, ivo daalder, pointed out: ´cameron was pushing for a no-fly zone, but in the us there was great skepticism. a no-fly zone wasn´t effective in bosnia, it wasn’t effective in iraq, and probably wasn’t going to be effective in libya… gaddafi was attacking people. a no-fly zone wasn’t going to stop him. instead, to stop him we would need to bomb his forces attacking people.’” of course, daalder was describing the ineffectiveness of a nfz while pushing for stronger measures. the crime of “optional imperialist war” remained the same, regardless of the methods eventually used. similarities with the syrian ‘civilian’ uprising of 2011 abound, as uk former chief of defense staff lord richards of herstmonceux later confirmed, intelligence on the composition of the rebel militias was not ‘as good as one would wish’, and when these rebels with affiliations to al-qaeda finally got their hands on the “tyrant”—a man who had on numerous occasions been feted in italy and france’s capitals, and who had built one of the most advanced social safety nets for his people—they simply do what jackals do, they tortured and murdered him, with the mainstream media, particularly in england and the us, reacting in a fashion that would make hyenas look like sheep: under headlines like “mad dog put down” most front pages showed gruesome pictures of gaddafi’s last moments, the word ’murdered’ nowhere to be found. demonized “tyrants” aren´t murdered, they are executed or, as the new york post stated: “killed by a yankee fan”, in a humorous reference to a boy wearing a new york yankees cap among the killers. (6) the new york times’ kareem fahim refers to the “trophies of war”, in an article filled with pictures of gaddafi’s and one of his sons’ dead bodies surrounded by cheering men, where any other “trophy”, as his golden gun, is only mentioned briefly to give the idea he isn´t referring to the corpses. (7) andrew gilligan wrote in the telegraph: “the one thing gaddafi retained to the very end was his ability to put on a show…” (8). ability shared by many journalists when cheering for interventions known for causing worse catastrophes than those that supposedly caused the intervention in the first place. many rationales are given for the explicit, openly celebratory content. as chris elliot, the guardian’s reader’s editor explains: “ on reflection – and having read the complaints – i feel less convinced about the way we used these photographs, although i still feel strongly that they are an important part of this story and should have been used. the scale of the photo on the newspaper front page of 21 october and prominent picture use on the website took us too close to appearing to revel in the killing rather than reporting it”. (emphasis added). this reveling over gaddafi’s corpse reflects the celebration of an establishment victory by its subservient propaganda media, but it also served to focus attention away from the unlawful killing of many others, and the exact details of how the killing took place. as media lens observed: “…but there was more than the lonely killing of a “tyrant” that went unreported. human rights watch reported that between six and ten people appeared to have been executed at the scene of the libyan leader’s capture. around 95 bodies were found in the immediate vicinity, many of them victims of nato airstrikes. in fact, it is clear that nato, with the assistance of special forces (although ground troops were strictly forbidden by un resolution 1973), had maintained a no-drive zone around sirte: a crucial factor facilitating the murder of gaddafi. cbs reported 572 bodies ‘and counting’ in sirte, including 300, ‘many of them with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head’, collected and buried in a mass grave”. (9) (emphasis added) there should be little doubt regarding the reasons behind the selective use of pictures of bloodied children by mainstream media (and many ngos), especially when they endorse calls for ‘humanitarian intervention’ against governments previously targeted for regime change, as it has already been clearly established in the case of syria long before the 2011 uprising, via many us secret documents revealed by wikileaks. propaganda is particularly transparent in this case: create a sense of guilt and impotence, prepare public opinion to demand what has already been planned elsewhere, in the darker councils of unaccountable power. the scandalous double-standard that selectively shows the suffering of “worthy” children while hiding the pain and death of those victimized for sordid reasons by the “exceptional nation” and its equally murderous accomplices dressed in civilized garb, is the great hypocrisy of our time, flowing smoothly from its deeply corrupt dna. the obvious options such as putting an end to the funding of ‘moderates’ by the us, in reality the open funding of terrorists, is never considered, as important facts contradicting the official imperialist narrative are systematically omitted by the “free press.” notes: ruptly tv. live: un security council meets to discuss situation in syria.

us advising soldiers to be ‘less masculine’ as military tries to curb flood of sexual harassment cases,"170619-n-aa175-092..san diego (june 19, 2017) command master chief (ret.) kathleen henson, from midland, mich.,, center, and uss makin island (lhd 8) sailors cut a cake during the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride month observance. makin island is homeported in san diego. (u.s. navy photo by mass communication specialist 2nd class eric zeak published at wikicommons)21st century wire says while military forces are fighting one enemy in the theatre of combat, another multi-front culture war is also being fought within their institutions. according to a recent report in military.com, us military lawyers have begun speaking about how sexual assault cases are flooding the military courts threatening to break the back of the military s legal system, and perhaps radically alter the institutional culture.after the release of the documentary, the invisible war, the issue of sexual assault in the military has again been thrust into the national spotlight, claiming that 1 in 5 u.s. female veterans have sustained some form of sexual assault.the issue of sexual assault in the us military first rose to national prominence in 1992 with the emergence of the infamous tailhook scandal. one likely reason for this new spike in reported cases could be because each military service branch has recently implemented new awareness programs as well as sexual assault prevention campaigns which actively encourage female troops to report anything they might feel constitutes sexual harassment or a constitutes a sexual assault.this also comes at a time where the us military has undergone the gradual process of becoming more gay friendly in order to advance issues of equality and to cater for its growing ranks of lgbt service men and women.military.com explains how the new liberal progressive agenda may be adversely affecting operations: military lawyers said the pentagon leadership has the right intentions, but these prevention campaigns have flooded military court rooms with so many sexual assault cases, it s made it harder to prosecute guilty sexual predators.prosecutors lack witnesses or strong evidence in the majority of cases, making it hard to yield a conviction, said michael waddington, a military defense lawyer and former judge advocate in the army. he sees too many cases that involve alcohol and depend on hearsay.the military has the resources to take many sexual assault cases to court, said philip cave, a military defense lawyer and retired navy lawyer. waddington estimated that ninety percent of the sexual assault cases taken to court-martial would be thrown out in a civilian court because of a lack of evidence.as a result, the military are now trying various other different initiatives to try and cope with a problem which to have spun out of control.rt international reports promoting empathy and cracking down on hypermasculinity may help the department of defense to reduce unwanted sexual behavior and improve combat readiness, a new government report on sexual violence in the military says.unwanted sexual behaviors such as sexual harassment, sexual assault, and domestic violence undermine core values, unit cohesion, combat readiness, and public goodwill, says the report, published this month by the government accountability office (gao) and signed by brenda farrell, director of defense capabilities and management.the report pointed out that interconnected, inappropriate behaviors are part of a continuum of harm that creates a climate conducive to sexual harassment, assault and violence. the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year 2017 expanded the definition of sexual harassment in the military beyond sex discrimination, to make it an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. both the pentagon and the separate service branches have yet to update their policies to reflect this new definition, the gao found.the report also urged the pentagon to incorporate the guidelines for preventing and dealing with sexual violence developed by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc).the pentagon is ignoring risk factors identified by the cdc such as alcohol and drug use, hypermasculinity, emotionally unsupportive family environments, general tolerance of sexual violence within the community, and societal norms that support male superiority and sexual entitlement, the report says.newport, r.i. (oct. 29, 2010) gunnery sgt. duncan hurst encourages an officer candidate to properly perform pushups during the first week of the 12-week officer candidate school at naval station newport. hurst is one of 12 marine drill instructors who train the candidates in military bearing, discipline, drill and physical fitness. (u. s. navy photo by scott a. thornbloom/released). also ignored by the dod are protective factors such as emotional health and connectedness, and empathy and concern for how one s actions affect others. cdc s research has also established that survivors of one form of violence are more likely to be victims of other forms of violence, that survivors of violence are at higher risk for behaving violently, and that people who behave violently are more likely to commit other forms of violence, the gao report notes, apparently seeking to make a distinction between violence in authorized military conflict and personal violence.noting that the dod instructed the services in 2014 to develop mechanisms for reporting incidents of sexual harassment anonymously, the gao said that such mechanisms are not yet part of the department-wide sexual violence policies.additionally, each service branch uses a different database format to record formal complaints of sexual harassment the navy uses excel spreadsheets, for example. while the gao does not go as far as to recommend a single database, the report does advocate improving and standardizing data collection so that the department of defense can further develop its understanding of the connection between unwanted sexual behaviors. having a single standard across service branches would also be helpful, the gao report says, noting that the us marine corps (usmc) updated its standards of conduct in may. the usmc made the change in response to the marines united scandal, where current and former members posted nude photos of female recruits in a facebook group, along with disparaging comments. while the marines now consider posting nude photos of others without consent to be harassment, other service branches do not as of yet.the gao report comes at a time of renewed interest in sexual harassment in the us. accusations of improper behavior have forced a number of hollywood celebrities, media executives and members of congress to resign or be removed from public life.in 2015, the obama administration lifted restrictions on having women in combat roles and set a deadline for allowing openly transgender troops to serve. in july this year, president donald trump said he would not allow transgender people to serve in any capacity, citing tremendous medical costs and disruption to the military. the matter is currently being fought over in the courts.so far, only men are required to register for potential draft ( selective service ) under us law. attempts to expand the requirement to women have failed to get enough votes in congress.see more at rtread the full us gov t g.a.o. report herein addition to new measures meant to mitigate the rise in sexual assault claims, general dictates on gender neutral language are also being rolled out apparently to protect vulnerable minority members of the armed service from being offended or triggered. this institutional trend is not limited to the us, as the institutional march of political correctness and its weaponization of gender identity politics is making its way through great britain s armed forces too where phrases such as mankind , chaps and sportsmanship have now been banned.the uk mail online says: the guide suggests the word chaps be swapped for the words people , friends , folks or you all . the phrase gentleman s agreement has also be banned. now, soldiers must use the term unwritten agreement . instead of sportsmanship members of the force are encouraged to say fairness . the two-page guide was compiled by the joint equality diversity and inclusion unit which has earned the nickname of jedi. many lgbt servicewomen believe the us military is too male-oriented (image: pinterest).as pc cleric cluture takes over the military s management through the leveraging of radical progressive power-politics, people should be aware that this tactic actually designed to break down existing institutions and rearrange the internal power structure.it s no surprise then why the russians are resisting soros-funded political colonization in their country, which moscow has correctly identified as subterfuge through the clear exploitation of these culture and gender war battle lines. imagequestion: how will the us and uk armed forces be run in 10 years, if this socialized agenda is fully rolled out?readers please leave comments belowread more cultural marxist news at: 21st century wire cultural marxism filessupport 21wire subscribe & become a member @21wire.tv",1,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.05263157894736842,11.863529411764706,18.56470588235294,0.0,0.0
millions of south koreans rise up against shadow government,"your news wire south koreans are rising up in their millions and demanding the overthrow of their government after a series of leaks proved president park geun-hye is a puppet controlled by a covert shadow government. in a furor eerily similar to that surrounding hillary clinton’s use of an email server and charity slush fund, critics are charging that park has irresponsibly managed classified information and benefited from corrupt practices using non-profits as a front. the south korean and u.s. comparisons stop there however. rather than apathetically accepting the situation – like in america – south koreans have risen up and the media has rounded on their leader. citizens have taken to the streets en masse and the country’s media have called for the president to step down immediately – or face impeachment. the essence of the scandal is this: it has emerged that park, famously aloof even to top officials and aides, has been taking instructions from a group known as the “eight fairies” including choi soon-sil, a shadowy billionaire with ties to george soros and angela merkel. choi has existed around the edges of south korean power circles for decades, but has never held an official position. posters of the president being controlled by puppet strings are cropping up all over south korea as country-wide protests continue to rage. recommended (4 months ago) france: protestors rise up in their millions against ruling class the washington post reports that “calls for her resignation — and even impeachment — are resonating from across the political spectrum, and her approval ratings have dropped to a record low of 17 percent, according to two polls released friday. on friday, park directed all of her top advisers to resign en masse, with her spokesman saying a reshuffle would take place, the yonhap news agency reported. kim jae-won, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, told a parliamentary session that park’s chief of staff had already stepped down. it’s not clear, however, whether it will be enough. “park geun-hye’s leadership is on the brink of collapse,” said yoo chang-sun, a left-leaning political analyst. shin yool, a right-leaning professor at myongji university, called it the “biggest crisis” since south korea was founded 70 years ago. “the president has lost her ability to function as leader.” choi is the daughter of the late choi tae-min, who was a kind of shaman-fortune teller described in a 2007 cable from the u.s. embassy in seoul as “a charismatic pastor.” locally, he’s seen as a “korean rasputin” who once held sway over park after her mother was assassinated in 1974. “rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result,” read the cable, released by wikileaks. park has strongly denied any improper relationship. but south korean media have uncovered evidence that, they claim, shows that choi soon-sil wielded undue influence over the president. jtbc, a television network, said it had found a tablet computer that contained files of speeches the president had yet to give, among other documents. the younger choi is said to have edited the landmark speech that park gave in germany in 2014, laying out her vision for unification with the north. the hankyoreh newspaper wrote that actual presidential aides “were just mice to choi’s cat.” she is also rumored to have created a secret group called “the eight fairies” to advise the president behind the scenes. tv chosun, the channel belonging to the chosun ilbo newspaper, aired a clip showing choi overseeing the making of an outfit for park, “raising doubt whether park made any decision at all without choi,” the paper said. south korean media have been full of photoshopped graphics to illustrate the relationship, including one showing park as a puppet and choi soon-sil pulling her strings. meanwhile, investigators are looking into allegations that choi siphoned off money from two recently established foundations that collected about $70 million from the federation of korean industries, the big business lobby with members including samsung and hyundai. prosecutors raided choi’s home in seoul this week looking for evidence. at the same time, there are allegations that the daughter of choi soon-sil was given special treatment when she applied for ewha womans university, one of south korea’s top colleges. local media have reported that her daughter’s grades were not good enough, so the rules were changed to give credit to applicants who had won equestrian awards, as she had. the already-embattled president of ewha resigned this week. ironically, this all comes less than a month after park’s administration instituted a wide-ranging new law aimed at cracking down on corruption and influence peddling. choi is in germany with her daughter and is refusing to return to south korea to answer questions, saying she is having heart problems and cannot fly. but in an interview with the segye ilbo, she denied creating the eight fairies group, owning the tablet or knowingly receiving classified information. “because i was not a government official, i had no idea that this was confidential,” she told the paper. park apologized tuesday for the scandal, saying she had always acted “with a pure heart.” then she canceled a planned meeting related to north korea on friday so she could consider ways to “resolve the nation’s anxiety and stably run the government,” according to a spokesman. she did, however, attend a ceremony in the southern city of busan, where university students shouted “park geun-hye should step down!” and “choi soon-sil must be arrested!” share:",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.89777777777778,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
warren drags trump sideways in brutal commencement speech — it’s beautiful (video),"if there s one democrat that donald trump is scared sh*tless of, it s sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.). warren was a massive thorn in trump s side during his presidential campaign, and she certainly hasn t let up after he got into the white house. and now that trump has pissed democrats off by firing fbi director james comey, he s probably regretful that one of them is warren.warren s feelings about trump s shady firing of comey were made known on friday, when warren gave a commencement address at the university of massachusetts amherst. during her speech, she basically wiped the floor with trump, encouraging the umass graduates to get involved in political causes and join the resistance. warren slammed trump s firing of comey when she said: i m trying to keep this apolitical but i can t help myself the principle that no one, no one in this country is above the law and we need a justice department, not an obstruction of justice department. and she didn t stop there. warren made sure to criticize all of trump s helpers equally, even mocking kellyanne conway for her alternative facts. warren joked: go online and read the facts, not the alternative facts the real facts. i have to say i had never thought we would need a modifier for facts. warren made sure to trash the spineless republicans that have helped trump succeed as well. zeroing in on senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), warren observed that nudging graduates to get involved in policy wouldn t make her ms. popularity. then she quipped: i think as long as mitch mcconnell is running the senate that s out of reach for me. this was a speech where warren let loose on the gop and trump administration, and we couldn t be more proud. warren has been a powerful voice in fighting trump s disgraceful agenda, and we need her to inspire america s youth more than ever. you can watch her speech below: america needs your commitment, sen. warren tells umass graduates at commencement https://t.co/pur56uvefh masslivenews (@masslivenews) may 13, 2017featured image is a screenshot",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.06666666666666667,10.154545454545456,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
"on trump travel ban, china says 'reasonable concerns' must be considered","beijing (reuters) - china appeared to offer mild criticism on monday of u.s. president donald trump’s banning of entry of people from seven muslim-majority countries, saying immigration policy was a sovereign right but “reasonable concerns” must be considered. trump signed a directive on the banning on friday. u.s. democrats and a growing number of republicans assailed the move and foreign leaders condemned it amid court challenges and tumult at u.s. airports. trump says his directive is “not about religion” but keeping america safe. trump has presented the policy as a way to protect the country from the threat of islamist militants. china’s foreign ministry, in a statement sent to reuters, said it had noted the reports of the u.s. administration’s decision. “china believes that adjusting immigration and entry and exit policy is an act within each country’s sovereignty,” the ministry said. “at the same time, relevant moves must also consider the reasonable concerns of relevant countries,” it added in a brief statement. it did not elaborate. china is in the middle of a week-long lunar new year holiday and government departments do not return to work until friday. china has been trying to pay a greater diplomatic role in the middle east, and has particularly close ties with iran and sudan, two of the seven countries on trump’s list. china is home to a muslim population of about 20 million people, including ethnic uighur people in the far western region of xinjiang, where the government says it is facing its own problem with islamist militants. rights groups and exiles says china’s repressive policies in xinjiang, including controls on islam, are the root cause of the unrest, which has killed hundreds in the past few years. china denies any repression and says it guarantees freedom of religion.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
brady campaign's ad draws ire of u.s. anti-gun violence activists,"boston (reuters) - the brady campaign to prevent gun violence said on friday it has sharply cut back an online ad that had used the names and faces of mass shooters and urged the news media not to identify them after the group drew criticism from other gun control activists. the group, named for former white house spokesman james brady, who was wounded in 1981 when a gunman tried to assassinate then-president ronald reagan, rolled out the “zero minutes of fame” campaign earlier this week. its goal, the group said, was to promote research showing that mass shooters, such as those who carried out the 2012 attacks in newtown, connecticut and aurora, colorado, had studied past gun attacks before carrying out their own. the prominent use of the names and images of adam lanza, who shot dead 20 children and six educators at a newtown elementary school, and james holmes, who fatally shot 12 people at an aurora movie theater, in the two-minute online spot angered fellow anti-gun-violence campaigners. the brady campaign's ad prompted a petition (chn.ge/1scfovp) on activist website change.org calling for the ad to be taken down. some 93 people had signed that petition as of midday friday. “it was very hurtful to many gun violence victims and survivors,” said anita busch, a los angeles-based entertainment journalist whose cousin was slain in the aurora massacre and who said she posted the petition. “for the brady campaign to not get it is just shocking, honestly.” the ad marked the launch of a piece of software for google’s (googl.o) chrome web browser that promised to remove the names and images of serial killers from news accounts and google web searches, replacing them with “(name withheld out of respect for the victims).” the brady campaign, one of the most prominent u.s. gun control organizations, said on friday it had cut back the ad’s contents after the complaints. a 14-second version of the ad viewed on friday featured no names or images of mass shooters. “our video was meant to educate the broader american public about what we can do to prevent gun violence, not to upset those hardest hit by it,” dan gross, the group’s president, said in an e-mailed statement. “we take this matter seriously and hope the steps we have taken to fix this are satisfactory to our victim advocates.” james brady survived the 1981 attack and went on to become a prominent gun control activist. he died in 2014.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.600000000000001,14.0,0.0,0.0
why do people dislike hillary clinton? the story goes far back,"there is – and perhaps there always will be – a dedicated group of people who don’t know hillary clinton personally, but nonetheless hate her. whether they are truly a “vast rightwing conspiracy” (as clinton called them in 1998) or just many in number and conservative in outlook, there’s no arguing that they exist or that they continue to try to influence public opinion on the democratic nominee. but even if people consider themselves savvy enough to reject the strangest conspiracy theories (sample claims include that she is a mass-murderer, a closeted lesbian faking her 40-year marriage, a member of the illuminati and/or an agent of the devil himself), there seems little doubt that an undercurrent of hostility spanning decades has had an impact upon how she is viewed. clinton’s unfavorability rating may not be as low as donald trump’s, but in an election year which has frequently degenerated into name-calling, she has attracted invective from both the left and the right. polls have frequently cited the public view that she is not trusted, while trump has rallied his supporters with the “crooked hillary” epithet. her links to wall street, her missing emails and her supposed responsibility for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the benghazi consulate are the ostensible reasons for some deeply personal attacks in 2016. but the roots of hostility towards her go much deeper. craig shirley, a ronald reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a conservative political consultant, said that, when hillary clinton arrived in washington dc as first lady, “she came from little rock with a reputation already established” as “such a militant feminist, difficult to deal with”. he noted that she faced hostility in arkansas politics and media when bill clinton was first elected governor, because she kept her maiden name.“here she comes, the feminist from wellesley and yale,” shirley explained of the supposedly prevailing attitude of the time, “down to little rock and brings her attitudes with her”. so by the time she arrived on the national stage in 1991, during bill clinton’s presidential campaign, the then-still-mostly-male press corps already had an idea of who they understood hillary clinton to be – a potential liability to her husband’s political career whose feminism and ambition were a bit unseemly. and, as she noted in her first autobiography, she gave them plenty of material with which to support that narrative. first, there was her much-maligned “i’m not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette” comment in response to a reporter’s assertion that she and her husband had “some sort of understanding and arrangement” about his infidelity. then, her out-of-context “i suppose i could have stayed home and baked cookies” comment, which came in response to attacks, which the clintons denied, by now-california governor jerry brown that she had only been a successful lawyer because her husband had steered business to her firm, implying that she should have confined herself to being a ceremonial first lady. and then, of course, came the scandals in which she was involved: whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which she’d invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment illegally; and travelgate, in which she – contrary to the then-normal practice of leaving the business of the white house to the president’s staff – was said to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office, who coincidentally was popular with the mostly-male white house press corps whose travel he arranged. the key question raised about whitewater and travelgate was not whether clinton had done anything actually wrong, but whether she had used illegal means to try to keep the media from finding out. the starr investigation, which eventually resulted in bill clinton’s impeachment, found that she had not, but by that time her reputation was established as someone unfriendly to the media who also maybe did not do the right thing. shirley conceded that “the press pounded on her” first in arkansas and then in washington, but did not believe that affected her relationship with the media, or that it was a driving factor in people’s attitudes towards her. “there’s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people,” he said. “people don’t like to be talked down to, and she has a terrible habit of talking down to people, with that smirk.” however, elaine kamarck, a senior fellow at the brookings institution who served in bill clinton’s administration, said she did not think that people’s dislike of hillary clinton is her own fault. “this business of people ‘not liking’ her is shaped by expectations, by television, by what we think people in authority ought to look like, and not who she actually is,” she said. “she is absolutely as likable, or more likable, than many male politicians,” she said. but while it is rare that people will compare a male politician they do not like to their fathers kamarck noted that clinton “reminds people of their mothers, or the schoolteacher they didn’t like.” (references to a “nagging wife” and “bitchy wife” are also common.) “i think there’s some misogyny in that,” said kamarck, noting that it’s exceedingly common for men who don’t hew to conventional standards of attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are more likely to be granted that visibility when they are younger and if they meet traditional beauty standards. “we will overcome this but, right now, the world is accustomed to saying old men are fine, they’re strong, they’re wise,” she added. “old women, we’re not so sure.”",0,11,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,4.791363636363638,5.836363636363637,0.0,0.0

"russia, u.s. stalemate over syria chemical weapons inquiry","united nations (reuters) - russia said on monday it was talking to the united states about the u.n. security council renewing an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in syria, but washington countered that moscow had refused to engage on a u.s.-drafted resolution. the mandate for the joint inquiry by the u.n. and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (opcw), which has found the syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an april 4 attack, expires on friday. russia vetoed an initial u.s. bid to renew the joint investigation on oct. 24, saying it wanted to wait for the release of the latest investigation s report two days later. it has since proposed its own rival draft resolution. we are talking to the u.s., it s not over yet, russian u.n. ambassador vassily nebenzia told reporters on monday. the inquiry s report found the syrian government was responsible for the april 4 attack using sarin in the opposition-held town of khan sheikhoun, killing dozens of people. the syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. russia has refused to engage on our draft resolution which the vast majority of council members agree is the most viable text in spite of our multiple attempts to consider russian concerns, a spokesman for the u.s. mission to the united nations said on monday. a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by russia, china, the united states, britain and france to pass. the council unanimously created the inquiry, known as the joint investigative mechanism (jim), in 2015 and renewed it in 2016. it is important that the jim is renewed but on an updated mandate because the systemic errors that we saw with the recent report should be corrected and that s the aim of our resolution, nebenzia said. he added that if the mandate of the inquiry was not renewed, it may send a bad signal, but the way the investigation has been conducted sends an even worse signal. the jim previously found that syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that islamic state militants used mustard gas. the draft text russia put forward without any negotiation is unhelpful, has no support, and cannot be taken seriously, said the spokesman for the u.s. mission. syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by russia and the united states.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.080000000000002,18.2,0.0,0.0

have squeezed the fighters and civilians remaining in parts of the city into a sliver of territory, spokesmen for the government and the opposition forces said on monday. the last civilians caught in the shrinking antigovernment enclave issued panicked calls for help. late monday, several residents reported via text and voice messages that they were crowded into abandoned apartments and rainy streets, exposed to shelling and afraid they would be killed or arrested if forces reached them, as antigovernment activists circulated reports of scores of summary killings in retaken areas. the united nations secretary general, ban said in a statement on monday that he was alarmed by reports of atrocities against a large number of civilians, including women and children. it appeared increasingly likely that the government would gain control of the whole of aleppo, the largest city in syria, within days, if not hours. videos from districts showed people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and honking horns. that would be a turning point in the civil war, cementing government control over all of syria’s most important cities and forcing the opposition and its backers to reckon with whether their movement, especially the armed rebellion, has failed. it also raises questions about how an increasingly confident president bashar will govern a deeply wounded and divided country where war still rages. mr. assad’s recent military successes have depended heavily on help from russia, iran and the lebanese shiite militant group hezbollah, which are reviled by many of mr. assad’s sunni opponents, and viewed with unease even by some of his supporters because of their growing power in the country. large areas of aleppo and other cities and towns have been reduced to rubble by the fighting. and rebel forces, kurdish militias and islamic state fighters are still operating in large areas of northern and eastern syria. that has been vividly clear in recent days, with islamic state fighters advancing in the desert city of palmyra, amid its ancient ruins, as the government focused on aleppo. for civilians trapped behind the battle lines in aleppo, though, more urgent questions loomed. time appeared to be running out to strike a deal to allow them to evacuate. rebel and opposition leaders want evacuees to be given an option to go to territory they control. many of the remaining civilians refuse to go to territory because they are afraid they would be jailed and tortured there. others say the bombardment in their districts is too intense to allow any escape. there were also reports in state news media of rebel shelling of areas. according to the russian government, mr. assad’s main foreign backer, more than 100, 000 people have fled from the rebel enclave to areas, and 2, 200 rebel fighters have surrendered. at least 13, 000 people have fled in the past 24 hours, it said. but there are still believed to be thousands of civilians trapped in districts that have been bombarded for more than 24 hours, while the army and its militia allies seized most of the southern part of the city. “an important call in the name of civilians to help them,” abdelkafi a teacher and antigovernment activist, said in a text message to a group of journalists. “stop bombing. take them out. ” the situation was so desperate, residents said, that it was unclear whether rebels and civilians there could even hold a meeting to decide whether to surrender and evacuate. “believe me, no one rejects the safety evacuation,” one resident, yasser abu said in a text message to the journalists’ group. “all of us are waiting, dying now in the last neighborhoods. ” hisham is a civilian member of the local council that had tried to govern the areas of aleppo, which once included half the city. mr. skeif expressed frustration that while international officials were in contact with rebel leaders, no one appeared to be talking directly to the trapped civilians. “all the political activists and the media, the relief workers, the unarmed, we are about 1, 000, including our families,” he said. though the government has said it would offer amnesty to anyone who surrenders, “if the regime entered, we will be slaughtered,” he said. “of course everybody is negotiating with those who are armed, but we are not armed. ” “the armed can defend themselves, but we can’t,” he added. mr. hamdo said in a series of text messages that families in aleppo were “waiting death together. ” “people are running, don’t know where,” he wrote. “people are under the rubble alive, and no one can save them. some people are injured in the streets, and no one can go to help them cuz the bombs are always on the same place. ” some rebel leaders have said that the united states, which backs some rebel groups, sent them a proposal that would allow evacuees their choice of destination, under security guarantees from russia. but trust has eroded, and no agreement had emerged by monday night. syrian and russian officials say the offensive in aleppo will continue until rebels surrender or die. “the issue of withdrawing militants is the subject of separate agreements,” sergei ryabkov, the russian deputy foreign minister, told the ria news agency on monday. “this agreement has not yet been reached, largely because the united states insists on unacceptable terms. ” the sticking point for months has been a dispute between russia and the united states over what to do about fighters linked with al qaeda who are among the rebel groups in eastern aleppo. the united nations estimates that about 10 percent of the 8, 000 rebel fighters in the city belong to a group, the levant conquest front. the rebels and their international backers say the figure is much lower the government says it is much higher. before the government broke through the rebel defenses, the united nations was proposing that the levant conquest front leave aleppo in exchange for three main broad concessions from the government side: an end to bombardment protection and aid for remaining civilians and some form of local administration for rebel areas. but the government rejected any form of saying that it would “reward terrorists,” while the rebels rejected versions of the deal that did not include it. now, there is no meaningful rebel territory left for the local opposition council to govern. “we are hearing terrifying s o s calls from the civilians, but we can’t do anything,” said bassem a spokesman for nour one of the main rebel groups in aleppo. “the fighters are defending, but they are retreating under pressure. unfortunately, the situation is very bad. ” the focus has now shifted to ending the bombardment and protecting the remaining civilians from reprisals, a reasonable fear in a country where, throughout the conflict, people have been tortured and killed in prison for opposing the government. “understand this,” mr. hamdo, who said his wife and small daughter were cowering in their apartment with him, wrote on twitter. “i can’t simply surrender and being captive. i am speaking out, and this is a crime. i might then ask death, and not got it. ” malek, an activist who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear that he would soon find himself in government territory, said he had moved on monday to a safer place for the 10th time since the offensive began, along with his cats, rocky and loz, the arabic word for almond. “why should i lie? i’m not well,” he said in a series of voice messages. “we are people, are being deleted from the human map. we have two neighborhoods and one street, and the regime will keep bombing this small area. ” bodies were stuck under the rubble, malek said, and even members of the white helmets civil defense group could not rescue anyone, because the group’s equipment had been destroyed and their members scattered by the shelling. still attempting to find humor, he said that his cat rocky had lost “his fiancée” along the way. “now he’s lonely,” malek said. dr. salem, a dentist who had kept his clinic open until last week, finally moved to one of the last rebel neighborhoods as his own was taken by government forces. he said he walked through streets shrouded in smoke, and littered with the dead and wounded, to a small area where thousands were crowded in a shrinking space. “there will be a massacre if one rocket falls here,” said dr. salem, using only his first name.",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.255714285714287,8.457142857142857,0.0,0.0
trump: 'we must replace globalism with americanism',"hillary clinton is back on the campaign trail after three days off. she courted hispanic voters in washington as donald trump talked economics in new york. trump unveiled more details of his plan to move the u.s. economy forward. ""we must replace the present policy of globalism, which has just taken so many jobs out of our communities and so much wealth out of our country, and replace it with a new policy of americanism,"" he explained. trump said as president, he will act to tap into the ""un-realized potential"" of american workers and their dreams. he pledged to create 25 million new jobs and grow the economy over 10 years at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent. u.s. economic growth under president barack obama has never reached 3 percent in any one year -- something that's never happened under any other u.s. president. ""i am going to lower your taxes very, very substantially. i am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulation. all of these regulations on your business, and in your life,"" trump insisted. afterwards, trump appeared on the ""tonight show."" in a lighter moment, host jimmy fallon made one request of the republican presidential nominee, asking him, ""can i mess your hair up? did you say yes?"" trump responded, ""go ahead!"" fallon then proceeded to dishevel trump's hair. meanwhile, clinton was back on the campaign trail in the nation's capital, with the james brown tune, ""i feel good,"" blasting from loud speakers. fresh from three-and-a-half days off resting from pneumonia, she spoke to the national hispanic caucus in washington, d.c. clinton wasted little time renewing her attacks against trump, going after him for telling the washington post he didn't want to answer the question right now of whether or not the president was born in the united states. ""this man wants to be our next president? when will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?"" she asked rhetorically. ""if we just sigh, shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are?"" the trump campaign later conceded that he does believe the president was born in the united states. even though polls show many voters don't like either candidate, clinton is facing an enthusiasm gap. only 50 percent of trump's supporters say they're excited to vote for him. the percentage of clinton supporters is even less, with only 43 percent saying they're excited about her. enthused or not, with less than two months to go before election day, both candidates know independent voters hold the key to winning the white house. and clinton says there's another important factor. ""what matters is who registers to vote and who is motivated and mobilized to turnout to vote,"" she said.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.1,12.425714285714289,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0

commercial dairy industry dumping millions of gallons of surplus milk,"by dr. mercola the u.s. food system is set up to protect industrialized, centralized food production and distribution, while efforts to decentralize food are kept strictly under wraps. there are many problems with this system, including the fact that food production is often out of sync with demand, leading to excessive amounts of waste. in 2016, for instance, the industrial dairy industry has dumped 43 million gallons of milk due to a massive milk glut. the glut is the result of a 2014 spike in milk prices, which encouraged many dairy farmers to add more milk cows to their farms. u.s. department of agriculture (usda) data shows that dairy cows have increased by 40,000 in 2016, with a 1.4 percent increase in production per cow. with too much milk and nowhere to sell it, prices have tanked. milk prices declined 22 percent in recent months to $16.39 per 100 pounds — a price so low some farmers can no longer afford to even transport it to the market. [1] the milk glut isn’t only affecting the u.s., either. it’s been felt globally, which means milk producers can’t export their surplus milk. what’s a dairy farmer to do with a surplus of milk? dump it — on fields, into animal feed or added to manure lagoons. usda steps in to bail out dairy cafos at its foundation, the milk glut is the result of dairy operations in the u.s. consolidating into concentrated feeding operations (cafos) — massive industrial “farms” with the sole goal of producing as much food as possible for the greatest profit. as reported by yale environment 360: [2] while milk carton imagery pictures bucolic, small farms, more than 50 percent of u.s. milk is now produced by just 3 percent of the country’s dairies — those with more than 1,000 cows, according to the u.s. department of agriculture (usda).the very largest u.s. dairies now have 15,000 or more cows. the usda, meanwhile, is coming to bail out these massive industrial enterprises. they’ve offered to buy $20 million of cheddar cheese from private sources, while milk producers try to get fast food outlets to add more cheese-heavy products to their menus. [3] the usda already purchased $20 million of cheddar cheese in august 2016. 1 in 4 us dairy cows contracts mastitis dairy cows raised in confinement and fed unnatural diets of genetically engineered (ge) grain are at high risk of illness, as are all animals raised in cafos. it’s estimated that one-fifth of livestock are lost due to diseases, which is an unrecognized source of food waste. [4] in the u.s. alone, 1 in 4 dairy cows contracts mastitis, which is a painful and serious udder disease. the result of producing large quantities of low-quality milk, mastitis is also the leading cause of therapeutic antibiotics treatment in u.s. dairy animals. in an era where antibiotic-resistant disease is taking millions of lives, any preventable causes of antibiotics usage should be curbed. mastitis is also preventable with clean, humane living conditions and proper diet, which lead to healthy cows. mastitis is also another source of food waste. milk with antibiotic residues cannot be sold, so milk from cows being treated with antibiotics for mastitis must be poured down the drain — to the tune of 1.2 billion servings a year (not to mention the addition of more antibiotics into the environment). [5] as noted by one study on antibiotics usage on a dairy cafo in new york state, “one of the best options to decrease antibiotic usage is to prevent the infection in the first place …” [6] indeed, which again brings us back to the way cows are raised. cafos are literal breeding grounds for infection. further, according to the 2016 global agricultural productivity (gap) report prepared by the global harvest initiative, once a cow contracts mastitis, she will probably not produce as much milk as before: [7] in addition, the cow’s level of milk production through her entire life cycle will likely fall below her potential as she is more susceptible to contracting mastitis on a recurring basis. the need for alternatives to protect the health of animals and preserve the long-term effectiveness of shared-class antibiotics has never been greater. as dairy cafos grow in size, so too does related pollution in wisconsin, the heart of dairy country in the midwest, farm consolidation is growing at an alarming rate. while the number of overall dairy farms in the state dropped by about one-third in the last decade, the number of such farms with more than 500 cows grew by 150 percent — and those with 2,000 or more cows grew at the fastest rate of all. [8] in addition to concerns like mastitis and milk gluts, such operations produce mind-boggling amounts of waste that represent one of the top sources of pollution in the u.s. yale environment 360 reported: [9] according to the epa, a 2,000-cow dairy generates more than 240,000 pounds of manure daily or nearly 90 million pounds a year. the usda estimates that the manure from 200 milking cows produces as much nitrogen as sewage from a community of 5,000 to 10,000 people. … milking cows … produce more manure than beef cattle and the holsteins that dominate the u.s. dairy industry produce almost twice as much manure as jerseys. cows that give more milk per cow also produce more manure and per-cow milk production has almost doubled since the 1970s. manure spills and leaching of waste from storage “lagoons” contaminate waterways and drinking water, posing serious environmental risks in wisconsin and elsewhere in the u.s. grass-fed dairy: better for the environment, the animals and human health demand for grass-fed dairy products is growing at an impressive rate, which is excellent news for the environment, animal welfare and human health. grass is a cow’s natural food. when cows eat grains, as they do on cafos that produce the milk used for most u.s. dairy products, their body composition changes. most importantly for you, these changes include an alteration in the balance of essential fats. milk (and meat) from cows raised primarily on pasture has been repeatedly shown to be higher in many nutrients, including vitamin e, beta-carotene and the healthy fats omega-3 and conjugated linoleic acid (cla). according to a study published in the journal plos one: [10] milk from cows consuming significant amounts of grass and legume-based forages contains higher concentrations of ω-3 fas [omega-3 fats] and cla than milk from cows lacking routine access to pasture and fed substantial quantities of grains, especially corn. in turn, lactating women consuming such milk have an increased cla concentration in their breast milk … this study confirms earlier findings that milk from cows consuming significant amounts of grass and legume-based forages contains less la [omega-6 linoleic acid] and other ω-6 fas [omega-6 fats] and higher concentrations of ala, cla and the long-chain ω-3s epa and dpa, compared to cows lacking routine access to pasture and fed substantial quantities of grains. grass-fed dairy is a solution to the problems created by industrial dairy unfortunately, only about 22 percent of u.s. dairy cows have access to pasture and even then access tends to be very limited. [11] grass-fed dairy producer maple hills creamery further shared reasons why grass-fed dairy is better: [12] when a cow eats corn and grain, the ph of the rumen (the first chamber of the cow’s stomach) becomes acidic; this destroys some flora and increases systemic inflammation, shortening the cow’s lifespan and increasing her risk of infection raising grass-fed cows requires fewer resources than growing grain crops to feed cafo cows, along with fewer chemical fertilizers and pesticides on a 100 percent grass-fed farm, manure is spread over pastures naturally as the cows roam; there is no need for environmentally destructive manure lagoons grass-fed dairy farming works best with small herds, which in turn helps support local economies and small farmers, who are able to claim a premium price for their premium dairy products “in short,” maple hills creamery writes, “100 [percent] grass-fed organically produced dairy is a viable solution to the industrial dairy system, focusing on holistic care of both the animals and land, rather than an end goal of highest production and maximizing the bottom line at the cost of animal welfare and environmental concerns.” support raw, grass-fed milk products raw milk dairy products from organically raised pasture-fed cows rank among some of the healthiest foods you can consume. they’re far superior in terms of health benefits compared to cafo-produced, pasteurized milk products, and if statistics are any indication, safer, too. while many believe that milk must be pasteurized before it can be safely consumed, it’s worth remembering that raw milk was consumed for thousands of years before the invention of pasteurization. it’s also important to realize that pasteurization is only really required for certain kinds of milk, specifically that from cows raised in crowded and unsanitary conditions, which is what you find in cafos. your dairy products should ideally be pasture-raised, not pasteurized. organically raised cows that are allowed to roam free on pasture where they can graze for their natural food source produce very different milk. their living conditions promote and maintain their health and optimize their milk in terms of the nutrients and beneficial bacteria it contains. getting your raw grass-fed milk and other food from a local organic farm or co-op is one of the best ways to ensure you’re getting high-quality food. read the full article at mercola.com. references",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.73,12.0,0.0,0.0
paul ryan under fire as health care is delayed again,"speaker of the house paul ryan’s ( ) leadership was called into question by new voices thursday night as hopes expire of passing a bill to repeal and replace obamacare before president donald trump’s first 100 days end on saturday. [at a meeting on the hill late thursday night, the speaker and his house republican leadership team decided to further delay the vote. with what appeared to be the acquiescence of conservatives in the freedom caucus and like club for growth and freedomworks, who took much of the blame for the failure of the first attempt to pass the american health care act (ahca) in march, hopes were buoyed that passage was imminent. instead, according to politico, house majority leader kevin mccarthy ( ) told reporters as he left the meeting, “we are not voting on health care tomorrow. we’re still educating members. ” syndicated radio host laura ingraham joined fox news’s hannity to vent her frustration with house republicans. “this is another loss for paul ryan,” she told host sean hannity: paul ryan was given this assignment to quarterback this legislation through the house. it wasn’t easy. it was going to be difficult. you have a lot of different factions, different people, different values, different personalities, but this is something you had to do. if you can’t get health care done, and done right, eight years after saying you were gonna do it … i don’t even know what to say about that. what does that say about your ability to lead at a critical time for our economy? ingraham then hinted she may be at the end of her patience with speaker ryan’s leadership. “i’m not gonna sugarcoat this. this is an embarrassment that this couldn’t get done,” she fumed. “you’ve got to get better communications. you have to know your caucus. otherwise, just give it to someone who can do it. that’s all i can say”: hannity’s next guest, fellow fox host lou dobbs, went even further in his condemnation of ryan’s handling of healthcare legislation. “laura, bless her heart, is trying to be nice to paul ryan,” he said. “i think the man is absolutely a disaster. he’s become nothing less than a caricature as house speaker. he’s inept, and the conference, if they don’t get rid of him, we’re going to watch this nonsense go on in perpetuity. ” dobbs explained that, in his view, president trump was doing all he could to move his political agenda along and that house gop leadership had to be held responsible for the sluggish pace on legislative priorities. he then explicitly called for speaker ryan’s ouster and replacement by rep. mark meadows ( ) chairman of the freedom caucus, or his predecessor in that position, rep. jim jordan ( ): paul ryan is not a conservative, never has been. his leadership team is a mixed bag of conservatives [and] moderates. the freedom caucus are traditional conservatives and great americans, all of them. … you and i both know mark [meadows] and jim jordan … for the great republicans they are. i think either one of those two would make such a terrific speaker. dobbs’s suggestion would not be the first time paul ryan and the freedom caucus found themselves in contention. members of the freedom caucus themselves have called ryan’s continuation as speaker of the house into question. the entire freedom caucus leadership also refused to endorse ryan in his 2016 primary challenge from the right by businessman paul nehlen, although they did assent to ryan’s speakership the previous year. ingraham and dobbs’s comments add to a growing chorus of voices on the right of the republican party calling for ryan to relinquish the speaker’s mace in the wake of the failure to see through the key gop platform plank of repealing and replacing obamacare.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.010000000000002,4.0,0.1,0.1

white house defends deportations after democratic complaints,"washington (reuters) - the white house on friday defended its deportation policy after complaints from democratic presidential candidates and congressional leaders that a sweep targeting central american illegal immigrants is inhumane. reuters reported on thursday that u.s. immigration officials plan a month-long series of raids in may and june to deport hundreds of central american mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally. white house spokesman josh earnest acknowledged that the deportation operations were consistent with president barack obama’s policy to focus on deporting criminals and recent immigrants who crossed the u.s. border illegally after jan. 1, 2014. “no one is removed if they have an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief,” earnest told reporters at a briefing. “if this serves to discourage people from considering to make this journey, that would be a good thing,” earnest said. in 2014, a wave of children fleeing violence in honduras, el salvador and guatemala surged across the u.s. border, inflaming the debate over how to deal with the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the united states. the planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries by central american women traveling with their children. in january, immigration officers rounded up 121 people, mostly women and children, in three states. that sparked criticism from democrats running to replace obama in the nov. 8 presidential elections. on thursday, democratic presidential front-runner hillary clinton reiterated her concerns about the new plans. “i’m against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities,” clinton said. democratic presidential candidate senator bernie sanders said he opposed “the painful and inhumane business of locking up and deporting families” trying to escape violence in other countries. in congress, senate democratic leader harry reid called on obama to reconsider the plans and focus on addressing the instability in central america. democratic representative luis gutierrez of illinois, a critic of the obama administration’s deportation policies, complained the administration was leaking word of the deportations to scare people away from coming to the united states. “the last time they did this, people called my office about raids that were not existent because it creates panic, it creates fear, it’s terrible, it’s a terrible way to bring about policy on this issue,” gutierrez told reporters. “stop talking about them as illegal immigrants. they are asylum seekers,” he said.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.111428571428572,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0
will barack obama delay or suspend the election if hillary is forced out by the new fbi email investigation?,"the economic collapse – by michael snyder just when it looked like hillary clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the fbi has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. on friday, fbi director james comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to hillary clinton’s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. according to the associated press , the newly discovered emails “did not come from her private server”, but instead were found when the fbi started going through electronic devices that belonged to top clinton aide huma abedin and her husband anthony weiner. the fbi has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in north carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. according to the washington post , the “emails were found on a computer used jointly by both weiner and his wife, top clinton aide huma abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry”, and according to some reports there may be “potentially thousands” of emails on the computer that the fbi did not have access to previously. even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force clinton out of the race, and if that happens could barack obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? let’s take this one step at a time. on friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new clinton emails hit the wires. the following comes from cnn … after recommending earlier this year that the department of justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that “appear to be pertinent” to the email probe. “in connection with an unrelated case, the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,” comey wrote the chairmen. “i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” at this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. but without a doubt huma abedin is hillary clinton’s closest confidant, and i have always felt that she was clinton’s achilles heel. journalist carl bernstein (of watergate fame) is fully convinced that the fbi would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered … we don’t know what this means yet except that it’s a real bombshell. and it is unthinkable that the director of the fbi would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the congress of the united states saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. so that’s where we are… is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? i’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election. one thing is, it’s possible that hillary clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the fbi and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the american people know what she thinks or knows is going on. people need to hear from her… if the fbi has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? it is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the fbi) tend to move very, very slowly. if there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. and of course barack obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. so those that are counting on this to be the miracle that donald trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. but if hillary clinton were to be forced out of the race by this fbi investigation, the democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. the following is from a u.s. news & world report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason… if clinton were to fall off the ticket, democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. dnc members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boat-rocking socialist sen. bernie sanders of vermont. dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots dnc members can choose to fill. but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. it would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the democratic national committee together on such short notice. if clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. in such a scenario, barack obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . since the election would not be “fair” until the democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. there would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but barack obama has not let the u.s. constitution stop him in the past. meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. according to a brand new abc news/washington post survey, donald trump is now only trailing hillary clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. and cnbc is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that trump will be the winner in november… an artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three u.s. presidential elections puts republican nominee donald trump ahead of democrat rival hillary clinton in the race for the white house. mogia was developed by sanjiv rai, founder of indian start-up genic.ai. it takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including google, facebook, twitter and youtube in the u.s. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. the ai system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. it had already correctly predicted the results of the democratic and republican primaries. without hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a trump victory would go way, way up. so if hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, barack obama and the democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. at this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.",1,19,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,13.556842105263158,18.126315789473683,0.0,0.0

obama visits wounded warriors after trump uses soldiers as campaign props,"on tuesday president obama visited wounded and ill soldiers receiving treatment at walter reed national military medical center in bethesda, maryland.obama spent about an hour making the rounds tuesday at walter reed national military medical center in bethesda, maryland.the white house says obama met with eight army members, two marines and one member each from the navy and air force. he also met with veterans and family members.cbs reporter mark knoller pointed out the visit was president obama s 27th to a military hospital since becoming commander-in-chief in 2009.there aren t any photos of the president inside the facility because he considers these trips private. during the presidential campaign in 2008, republicans tried to use the lack of photos as evidence then-senator obama had snubbed the troops. it was a lie.obama s reverence for the troops stands in strong contrast to the recent episode with presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump.while feuding with fox news during the republican primaries, trump threw a temper tantrum about debate moderator megyn kelly and skipped a debate on fox news. instead, trump threw what he claimed was a fundraiser for military charities and announced at the event that he had raised several million dollars for those groups.trump proceeded to congratulate himself at several campaign events in the following days.but the washington post looked into it, and could find no evidence that trump had made the donations, despite using them to promote himself.trump was eventually pressured into donating to the groups, months after he claimed he had done so in the first place, and held a defensive, petty press conference claiming that nothing had gone wrong, despite the ample evidence to the contrary.while president obama, who is tasked with the decision of whether to put the military in harm s way, quietly honors military service and sacrifice, trump used them as human shields and as a cheap and tawdry campaign gimmick.featured image via flickr",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.22727272727273,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
domestic u.s. politics of war with russia,"eric zuesse first, the context in which the issue of war against russia has been raised: syria’s government is allied with russia’s government, and ‘the west’ is trying to overthrow syria’s government and is bringing into syria, and arming, tens of thousands of jihadists there, as the footsoldiers to do it. syria and russia are bombing the people that we are bringing in. the presidential candidate of the u.s. democratic party, hillary clinton, is a longstanding and ardent proponent of the u.s. establishing a “no-fly zone” over at least the parts of syria where non-isis jihadists — the jihadists that are financed and armed by the u.s. and its allies (mainly by the sunni fundamentalist royal families who own saudi arabia and qatar) — have conquered territory from syria’s (legitimate and internationally recognized) government. it’s conquest of syria, that the u.s. is backing. the u.s., in both law and fact, is already participating in an invasion of syria. syria’s government is run by the ideologically committed anti-sharia-law and non-sectarian ba’ath party, under president bashar al-assad, who happens to be nominally an alawite shiite (and fundamentalist sunnis hate shiites, and all of the jihadists are fundamentalist sunnis, just as the royal saudi and qatari families are ), and assad has always crushed jihadists in syria — until barack obama became the u.s. president. as soon as obama came into power, he and hillary clinton were working behind the scenes for the overthrow of bashar al-assad. clinton has committed herself clearly to completing what president obama has started. and she intends to do it by means of instituting in syria a no-fly zone like she did in libya ( a big win for her ). but there is a big difference: russian planes weren’t defending muammar gaddafi’s libyan government. russian planes are defending bashar al-assad’s syrian government. for the u.s. government to institute a no-fly zone in syria would mean that the u.s. would shoot down syrian government planes that are bombing the u.s.-backed jihadists who are fighting to overthrow and replace assad’s government. of course many civilians are getting bombed by both the u.s. and syrian sides, and some of the victims of the syrian government’s side are publicized on u.s.-allied television in order to stir hatred against assad and help (the non-isis, u.s.-backed) jihadists (such as al qaeda in syria), but this is the way of war — and the propaganda for war — and no “no-fly zone” will improve that situation, but could possibly make it far worse. russia’s participation in the syrian war is not an invasion, but america’s is. the syrian government had requested assistance from the russian government to help kill all of the jihadist groups (not only isis but al qaeda in syria and all the others, all of which are backed by the u.s. and by the royals who own saudi arabia and qatar). the jihadists are trying to overthrow and replace syria’s secular government. on 30 september 2015, russia started its bombing campaign there, which continues. consequently, the u.s.-established no-fly zone in syria would also be shooting down russian bombers. at that point, where the u.s. and russia are at war against each other in syria due to america’s no-fly zone (in a country where we’re invaders , not invited in by the nation’s government, such as the russian planes are), either one side or the other would surrender, or else nuclear war would result. how likely would syria and russia be to surrender syria? how likely would the u.s. be to surrender to russia and syria? (after all: hillary clinton is passionately anti-russian and anti-syrian.) in other words, and in short: nuclear war is the likely outcome if hillary clinton becomes elected president of the united states . it would be practically unavoidable, if she is elected. the domestic u.s. politics that are associated with this shocking but clear fact are complex, but are likewise clear: the american public simply don’t know or understand these facts; and the reason they don’t is that these facts are hidden from them, as will be exemplified in the following ways: on october 26th, the u.s.-allied propaganda-agency reuters headlined “britain, u.s. sending planes, troops to deter russia in the east” and pretended (without even acknowledging the actual facts of the matter) that this nato action is a response to ‘deter’ russia because russia had accepted in 2014 the overwhelming desire of the residents of crimea to become russian citizens after the coup that u.s. president barack obama’s administration had perpetrated in ukraine during february 2014 , overthrowing the democratically elected ukrainian president viktor yanukovych, for whom 75% of crimeans had voted . even western-sponsored polls that were taken of crimeans both before and after the resulting crimean 16 march 2014 referendum on whether crimea should be restored to being again a province of russia (which crimea was until the soviet dictator khrushchev had arbitrarily transferred crimea to ukraine in 1954) showed that over 90% of crimeans wanted to do this and that even a higher percentage of them were mad as hell against what america was doing and extremely supportive of russia’s position on this matter, but the u.s. government’s position is that it was instead ‘conquest of land’ by russia, and the u.s. and its allies are pouring troops and weapons onto and near russia’s borders in order to defend against ‘ russian aggression’ . the power of sheer propaganda! it’s crucial in politics. the way the reuters ‘news’ report phrased this matter was “nato’s aim is to make good on a july promise by nato leaders to deter russia in europe’s ex-soviet states, after moscow orchestrated the annexation of the crimea peninsula in 2014.” that’s not as much of a lie as the u.s. president’s use of the word ‘conquest’ to describe russia’s role there is, but it’s close. reuters’s report opened with “britain said on wednesday it will send fighter jets to romania next year and the united states promised troops, tanks and artillery to poland in nato’s biggest military build-up on russia’s borders since the cold war.” but in order to play down the danger here, they refused to headline their ‘news report’ with that, it’s real, actual, news, which was: “nato’s biggest military build-up on russia’s borders since the cold war.” that headline would have attracted far more readers, but in the ‘news’ business in a dictatorship , that’s not the main objective when reporting news that the government wants to bury instead of to go viral. it’s part of ‘news’-management, which includes burying what is important. then, reuters quoted the u.s. secretary of ‘defense’, who said: “it’s a major sign of the u.s. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.” after the soviet union dissolved in 1991, and in the same year terminated its warsaw pact military alliance that had been set up by the soviet union to mirror america’s nato alliance, nato expanded right up to russia’s borders and is therefore highly aggressive and threatening toward the people of russia , who don’t like missiles minutes away, any more than americans would like if russia took over mexico and placed troops and missiles on our border. but, according to the u.s.-and-allied propaganda-line, this strangulation of russia by nato is ‘deterrence’ against russia. then, when russia responds to such u.s.-aggression by positioning troops and weapons to their side of their border, that’s called ‘aggressive’. and nato is ‘responding’ to ‘russia’s aggressive moves’. it’s like blaming a raped woman for trying to defend against her rapist. hillary clinton’s actions (never her rhetoric) show that she wants more of that type of thing, especially regarding the russian people, whom the u.s. government wants to conquer by eliminating their international allies, one by one — and then by eliminating their own leader vladimir putin himself, after the original ‘regime change in iraq’ (whose saddam hussein was the first russia-friendly leader to be eliminated; then muammar gaddafi, then bashar al-assad, then viktor yanukovych ). the pattern is clear. and now nato is going in for the kill. but this reality is not how america’s ‘impartial’ press reports what is actually a buildup toward a possible nato invasion of russia. of course, america’s republican party (or conservative) press have long been controlled by neoconservatives (they were all supportive of ‘regime-change in iraq’, and the american public never punished them for that — mega-criminal deceit goes unpunished), and so they don’t even pretend to be anything more than nationalistic mouthpieces for the u.s. government’s conquests. however, the democratic party’s (or liberal) press do need to cater to some progressive anti-nationalistic audiences. yet still neoconservatism dominates at such newspapers as the new york times and the washington post , as well as in magazines such as the atlantic , the new republic , and foreign policy , all of which are, if anything, neoconservative democratic party organs. all of them endorse hillary clinton. but there is a small progressive wing to american ‘journalism’; and, so, here is how one of the progressive sites, common dreams, handles this crucial matter, which might soon end the world as we know it: they headlined on october 26th, “nato preps ‘biggest military build-up on russia’s borders since cold war’,” and opened (quoting from reuters and other western sources): playing “a dangerous game,” nato pushes allies to send more troops and military equipment to eastern europe. nato is pushing all allies to deploy more troops and military equipment to russia’s borders, further ratcheting up tensions as the west prepares for “its biggest military build-up on russia’s borders since the cold war,” as reuters observed. “france, denmark, italy and other allies are expected to join the four battle groups led by the united states, germany, britain, and canada to go to poland, lithuania, estonia, and latvia, with forces ranging from armored infantry to drones,” reuters reported. “yet with the u.s. openly talking [about] a war with russia, the continued deployments seem far from a purely defensive measure,” argued antiwar.com’s jason ditz [who said]: ”diplomats also suggested it was only partly about sending a message to russia, and that the real point of the latest push is to get a bunch of nations involved as a ‘message’ to u.s. presidential nominee donald trump, who has complained the u.s. is spending too much defending europe and that europe isn’t doing enough on its own. that underscores the cynical nature of the deployments, and indeed the sort of thing adding to the sense of nato being obsolete, that they feel they can afford to organize major deployments just for the sake of scoring political points in member nations’ elections.” these moves are shortsighted, to say the least, wrote gilbert doctorow of the american committee for east-west accord [by saying]: “america’s steady campaign of expanding nato, […] its vilification of russia, and its information war based on lies” are part of “a dangerous game” that is pulling all sides inevitably closer to war, doctorow argued. nothing was provided there that highlighted the stark contrast between the strongly anti-invasion republican presidential candidate trump, versus the strongly pro-invasion democratic candidate clinton. in other words, no essential context was provided — no context of a policy-decision that america’s voters will have to make, choosing the one or the other to be the next president. instead, ‘progressive’ news-sites treat their readers and audiences as mere fools who think that voting for a third-party candidate in a u.s. presidential contest is not a wasted vote, like refusing to vote at all is. the overwhelming majority of the 100+ reader-comments to that common dreams report, who expressed a presidential choice said “vote green” or “jill stein,” referring to a third-party candidate who stands no chance of winning even one of the 50 u.s. states. in other words: the readers at this progressive site are so unconcerned about the future of the world, that they don’t even care whether the next u.s. president would be hillary clinton who would cause nuclear war, or donald tump who has consistently argued against her neoconservatism and emphasized the necessity of ending the u.s. government’s rabid hostility toward russia and ending expansion of nato up to russia’s borders. in other words: despite progressive rhetoric, they’re actually oblivious to the world’s future — oblivious to the most important thing of all. and, so, that is the domestic politics of the war that the u.s. elite are determined to wage against russia. the fix is in for nuclear war. to the owners of the media, the people who hire and fire — and promote and demote — the “news’ people, and thus who shape what the public know and understand and what the public don’t, it’s better that the outcome of the u.s. election be determined by whether or not donald trump is a rapist, than by whether or not hillary clinton will bring about nuclear war with russia. so, it’s the way things are. in the u.s.-allied nations such as britain, the ‘news’ media are similar. for example, britain’s liberal guardian headlined on october 27th, “nato and russia playing dangerous game with military build-up: russia wants to detract from problems at home and position itself as a superpower, and nato troop movements can only help.” it said that, “amid western suspicions the russian fleet will be used to flatten civilians in aleppo, nato’s apparent goal here is to deter future acts of aggression on european territory by vladimir putin’s revanchist russia.” that might as well have been written by the obama administration, as by some ‘news’ person. ‘the west’ is clearly behind the plan. of course, the american public haven’t yet spoken.",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.368571428571428,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0

a semi-radical plan to elect more moderates to congress,"with ideological extremism on the rise in congress, president barack obama argued during his state of the union that america must reform its elections. ""if we want a better politics, it’s not enough to just change a congressman or a senator or even a president,"" obama said. ""we have to change the system to reflect our better selves."" obama was less clear on how, exactly, america might pull this off. the president criticized gerrymandering — the process by which parties draw oddly shaped, highly partisan congressional districts — and called for campaign finance reform and repealing restrictions to voter access. these reforms, however, have gone nowhere. in the meantime, the incentives have only increased for politicians to stake out maximalist positions, with little structural reward for moderates who anger their bases. it raises the question: does anybody out there have a better idea? anne kim, a policy editor at washington monthly and a senior fellow at the progressive policy institute, has proposed a new way to help fight polarization of congress. in an essay published in the winter 2016 issue of democracy, kim calls for the creation of one ""at-large"" congressional seat in every state, chosen by voters statewide. we currently determine our house seats by slicing up a state's map into a bunch of different smaller segments, except for states with very small populations that only get one at-large representative. under kim's plan, every state with more than two representatives would get an ""at-large"" house member — someone who would be accountable to the whole state, rather than a narrow sliver of it. vox's matthew yglesias has already advanced the idea of using at-large districts to reduce polarization. these plans envision treating the representatives as one at-large group, to be doled out proportionately after a statewide vote. kim's proposal is more modest and perhaps more practical. by only asking for states to add one at-large seat, the plan preserves the benefits of the basic idea without requiring a wholesale transformation of how we conduct congressional elections. federal and state law would have to be changed to make it possible. but doing so, kim says, would likely create several dozen house seats that are by definition not gerrymandered — and, as a result, are more responsive to the actual demands of their constituents. ""this seems like a simple and easy-to-understand mechanism to get moderate americans a little more excited about a way for their voices to actually be heard,"" kim says. voters across a state are significantly more moderate than those in a gerrymandered district. having a bloc of house members picked through statewide elections, kim says, would make it at least more likely that there's an institutional incentive for politicians to move to the center. ""the creation of new 'plurality-moderate' at-large seats in many states would increase the number of competitive seats while bolstering the odds for moderate candidates,"" kim writes in her democracy essay. ""challenging the status quo might be an excellent and concrete opportunity to test moderate muscle."" there's also precedent for these kinds of seats. before 1967, at-large districts existed in southern states as a way to prevent african americans from getting elected to congress. but that doesn't mean they couldn't be brought back now to serve a new purpose, kim says. it would take an act of congress — and thus a rare moment of bipartisan consensus — for the plan to be enacted. but in our interview, kim argued that her plan could help an embattled republican leadership that wants to regain control of a nomination process increasingly ceded to hardcore conservatives. ""it's a way to defang the tea party. ... i'm not sure the gop has gotten any favors by allowing that wing of the party to get as powerful as it has been,"" kim says. she added: ""if the gop has learned anything about reasserting the power of the establishment, this is certainly the way to do it. because it would give gop moderates a voice."" the idea sounds interesting, but it's unclear if at-large house members would reduce political polarization even if it were somehow implemented, according to experts interviewed for this story. ""i think most political scientists would tell you that this is a nonstarter. for one thing, we already have 50 at-large districts — states — and the senate is just as polarized as the house,"" said morris fiorina, a political science professor at stanford university who has done extensive research on polarization. american politics is moving inexorably to the margins, and even in a statewide vote the candidate will have to win a primary, fiorina noted. in other words, there's just not much reason to believe gerrymandering is the main culprit here. ""single-member or at-large, safe district or competitive, the candidate has to win a primary dominated by the wingnuts,"" fiorina said. matthew dickinson, a professor of political science at middlebury college, had a more measured response to the idea. he, too, noted that the senate is highly polarized, and questioned the premise that gerrymandering was the key contributing factor to the rise of extremism in congress. ""it's an interesting proposition,"" dickinson said of kim's proposal, ""but i suspect it will have less of an impact in reducing polarization than the author thinks."" but dickinson raised a possible counterargument to the counterargument. yes, the senate is very polarized. but is the senate polarized at least in part because the house is? dickinson pointed to an academic paper from 2011 that argued this point, noting that many of the highly partisan senators of today began as highly partisan members of the house. ""the polarization in the house has directly contributed to polarization in the senate,"" write sean m. theriault, of the university of texas austin, and david rohde, of duke university. in addition, kim, the author of the democracy piece, also pushed back on the idea that the senate and the house were equally driven by party factionalism.

colossal white house screw up leads to trump endorsing child labor in new ad (video),"if there is one thing going for the american people against trump s assault on decency, liberties, and intelligence it s that he and his team are so incompetent that they can t even do the simplest things without humiliating themselves. an obvious example of that sheer stupidity comes at us from this pro-trump ad, which he recently proudly posted to his facebook page.thanks to the crack team over at the white house, a simple spelling mistake turned trump s coal fetish into a call to relax child labor laws. in boasting about his efforts to kill clean energy and bring back coal, he promised to put our minors back to work. the word he was looking for was miners. apparently, nobody at trump s white house noticed the typo. it s been six hours and nobody has bothered to fix it, either.this would be a funny gaffe if it weren t so depressingly common. trump has issued statements misspelling the names and titles of foreign leaders. trump has misspelled words as simple and varied as denmark (denmakr), honored (honered), among (amoung), and unprecedented (unpresidented).a white house statement bragging about betsy devos spelled education wrong. she s the secretary of education.the library of congress gift shop had to pull a poster honoring trump s inauguration when people noticed it, too, had an ridiculously simple typo.no joke: purchasable copy of trump's inauguration print, direct from the library of congress site. a 5th grader would've spotted this typo. pic.twitter.com/zomwsmojyv jules winnfield (@paulm4749) february 12, 2017meanwhile, trump s minor/miner gaffe has another unfortunate side effect for his administration reminding us that his good friend newt gingrich actually wants to repeal child labor laws. as writer parker molloy points out, newt, a full-time moron who moonlights as a part-time shithead on evenings and weekends, once called child labor laws truly stupid and suggested poor kids be encouraged to become janitors at their schools, picking up the trash of their classmates to earn lunch money.speaking at the john f. kennedy school, gingrich said that children in the poorest neighborhoods are trapped in child laws that prevent them from earning money. most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor and pay local students to take care of the school, gingrich said according to a cnn video.trump hasn t gone that far. he s only hinted that he would prefer children work. during obama s administration when he was eager to pretend the unemployment rate was sky high he would sometimes count children as part of his inflated unemployment figures.instead of worrying about coal miners and school-aged minors, trump, who was born rich and stayed that way, might want to invest in some additional schooling for himself. basic grammar and spelling would be a good place to start.featured image via scott olson/getty images",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.566666666666666,14.0,0.0,0.0

republicans offer few tax plan details at high-profile event,"santa barbara, calif. (reuters) - republican tax writers from the u.s. house of representatives promoted their legislative goals at a special gathering in california on wednesday, but offered few new details about provisions that may end up in their long-sought overhaul plan. as wall street analysts warned that president donald trump’s controversial statements about virginia protests on saturday that turned deadly were hurting republicans’ prospects for progress on domestic policy, the lawmakers assembled in santa barbara to say their tax reform agenda is moving forward. kevin brady, chairman of the tax-writing u.s. house of representatives ways and means committee, spoke in broad brushstrokes about the effort at rancho del cielo, the country home of former president ronald reagan, a republican who oversaw the last major tax code overhaul in 1986. “if you look at today’s tax code you can’t even recognize the principles that made the reagan reforms such a triumph for the american people,” brady said. asked whether the plan would have specific provisions, brady said: “we’re working through the details of the overall tax plan with the white house, president trump, and senate tax writers as well.” “we have more work to do. i anticipate continuing to work through august with the white house and senate, bring forward a tax reform plan at the ways and means committee after we return,” brady said, adding he wanted to get legislation to trump before the end of the year. brady was joined by representatives peter roskam, david schweikert and carlos curbelo, all republican committee members. market expectations for tax reform have declined in recent weeks, analysts said, and dimmed further after trump’s tuesday press conference, where he said both sides were to blame for a deadly rally in charlottesville, virginia, between neo-nazis, white supremacists and counter-protestors. before the event, curbelo, the son of cuban exiles who emigrated to the united states, told reporters that trump’s remarks marked “the lowest point yet” in his presidency. “in a way we’ve become accustomed to working in a very distracting environment. that’s not new. now this is on a whole different scale,” he said. “while you have all of these other headlines, the public isn’t going to be paying very much attention to the legislative agenda.” still searching for his first major legislative achievement after 208 days in office, trump has refocused on overhauling the tax code, but he has been constantly distracted by controversies involving north korea, race relations and investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and moscow. trump was forced to disband two high-profile business advisory councils on wednesday after corporate ceos quit the committees in protest over his remarks about the violence in charlottesville. brady has remained bullish on the chances for a tax overhaul even after a republican push to dismantle obamacare collapsed in july. at wednesday’s event he told reporters the differences between a healthcare and tax overhaul are “just about everything.” as they did with obamacare, the party has launched a nationwide publicity campaign for tax reform without first hammering out the final details of their proposal. the 1986 tax overhaul under reagan was the result of a multi-year, bipartisan negotiation. republicans are seeking to do key portions of tax reform within months, without democratic support. republicans have not yet introduced tax legislation and party leaders have already discarded key pieces of their initial, ambitious plan. no revenue-raising provisions have been agreed upon to replace those that were discarded. corporate lobbyists and independent experts have said congress and trump are far apart on critical issues, such as how to slash rates without ballooning the federal deficit. brady downplayed those differences on wednesday, saying they planned to unify behind “one bold plan.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0
new handgun design folds up like smartphone…but is this really a good idea?,"tell us your thoughts about this new gun design in the comment section below. is this compact, folding gun a great idea or will it make going through security a nightmare? while gun control remains one of the biggest debates in the country, one man wants to make concealing guns easier. he created a pistol that folds into what looks like a smartphone easy to carry and hard to detect.cnn money spoke with the creator of the ideal conceal pistol, kirk kjellberg of minnesota, who said he got the inspiration for the handgun after a little kid saw his concealed pistol in a restaurant and told his mom, bringing unwanted attention to the fact that he was packing heat.the problem with his product is it may stoke fears rather than quell them.the pistol itself is a double-barreled .380-caliber derringer that only holds two bullets and can only be fired when it is folded out. it isn t available for sale yet and the patent is still pending, but it looks like ideal conceal has the intention of producing it.because the gun is disguised even when it isn t concealed, it may require a concealed carry permit even if you aren t hiding it depending on your state s laws. in new york, weapons that are disguised to look like something other than a firearm are illegal.while this may seem like a great idea for gun owners who don t want to alarm people with the presence of their firearm, what about the people who have bad intentions? the ideal conceal pistol can easily be brought anywhere, making it past metal detectors and security pat downs under the guise of being a phone. if anything, the existence of this weapon could make security even more of a pain to get through imagine if everybody s smartphones had to be inspected on top of everything else. via: mashable",1,13,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,7.633846153846157,8.276923076923078,0.0,0.0
"14 days to do 14 things, if hillary’s indicted-extreme violence expected","14 days to do 14 things, if hillary’s indicted-extreme violence expected update: hillary clinton is again under investigation by the fbi. if she is indicted, her people will undoubtedly launch a cyber attack on the elections and blame the russians. hillary has tipped her hand many times. if this happens, you must hasten your preparations. if hillary skates, again, we still only have a short window to all hell breaking loose. please prepare now! the common sense show issued an alert yesterday with regard to the likelihood of widespread violence, regardless of who wins the election. the violence may not be dramatic on november, but i believe that a crescendo will be reached by the holidays. there are literally dozens of troop movements and a number of martial law events taking place as i write these words. the bottom line is, half of the country hates the other half of the country and pressure valve is ready to blow. and if trump wins, the violence factor will escalate exponentially as evidenced by the firebombed gop building in north carolina. when these events come to fruition, it could potentially paralyze this nation and bring the economy to a standstill. subsequently, the grocery store shelves could be empty within two days and food riots would likely commence by sundown of the second day. all americans would instantly be in danger. local law enforcement would be overwhelmed. what would be your chances of survival? yesterday, i wrote about the fact that fema has conducted research studies on america’s level of preparedness and the news is not good. fema concluded that 72% of all americans are not prepared to survive what is coming in other words, when society begins to fragment, you and your fellow preppers are outnumbered by a 3 to 1 margin. are you prepared for 3 out of 4 of your neighbors climbing through your windows in search of life-saving supplies? the fema preparedness reports in response to concerns about strengthening the nation’s ability to protect its population and way of life (i.e., security) and ability to adapt and recover from emergencies (i.e., resilience), the president of the united states issued presidential policy directive 8: national preparedness (ppd-8). ppd-8 is a directive for the department of homeland security to coordinate a comprehensive campaign to encourage americans to practice national preparedness. despite efforts by fema and other organizations to educate american citizens on becoming prepared, growth in specific preparedness behaviors has been limited. government programs to this end are nearly nonexistent. i have spent the past week illustrating how a coming economic collapse is unavoidable and how the elite have conspired to steal as many of your assets as possible prior to the collapse. this article presents some common sense things one can do which could increase the chances of surviving a major societal meltdown resulting from an economic collapse. if you have any doubts as to what is coming, i strongly encourage you to read what i have written about on this topic over the past several months. even ray charles could see that our economy will not be around much longer in its present form. it is always best to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. for the purposes of this article, it is possible that society will not totally collapse even if the dollar does. however, large segments of societies always collapse when an economic collapse happens. surviving the worst case scenario is the purpose behind what will be covered here. we have about 14 days to do the following 14 things: 1. the creation of a pseudo-identity it may be necessary to become invisible in the event you think you believe that your name could be on a (red) list because roundups will usually occur in dire situations. therefore, the creation of a pseudo-identity could become very important. 2. it takes money to prepare if you have read the articles at the above links, you should have concluded that it is the height of stupidity to leave your life savings in an institution that is planning to steal from you. you need to divert your cash, other than the ability to pay basic bills, in preparation for what is coming. getting your money out of the bank has become an art form and you need to be careful. there is a barrier to your ability to procure some of these life-saving and life-extending supplies. right now, you do not have full access to your money. as you move to withdraw the bulk of your money, there are three federal banking laws that you should be cognizant of, namely, cash transaction report (ctr), a suspicious activity report (sar) and structuring. cash transaction reports federal law requires that the bank file a report based upon any withdrawal or deposit of $10,000 or more on any single given day.the law was designed to put a damper on money laundering, sophisticated counterfeiting and other federal crimes. to remain in compliance with the law, financial institutions must obtain personal identification, information about the transaction and the social security number of the person conducting the transaction. before proceeding with the planned withdrawal of your money, i would strongly suggest that you read the following federal guidelines as it relates to ctr’s as produced by the the financial crimes enforcement network (fincen). all the federal regulations contained in this article are elucidated in this series of federal reports. structuring and sar there will undoubtedly be some geniuses whose math ability will tell them that all they have to do is to withdraw $9,999.99 and the bank and its protector, the federal government will be none the wiser. it is not quite that simple. the bank is required to file a suspicious activity report (sar) which serves to notify the federal government of an individual’s attempt to structure deposits or withdrawals by circumventing the $10,000 reporting requirement. structuring transactions to prevent a ctr from being reported can result in imprisonment for not more than five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. if structuring involves more than $100,000 in a twelve month period or is performed while violating another law of the federal government, the penalty is doubled. enforcement much like the enforcement of our tax laws, the federal government’s enforcement of its banking laws as it relates to ctr’s, sar’s and subsequent structuring is quite draconian. civilian asset forfeiture laws come into play. the government can seize your bank accounts while it determines if a crime has been committed. the government can literally seize your assets in perpetuity without an order of the court. of course, you could try and sue but you will be up against the deep pockets of the federal government and the case could take years. by the time your case is decided, the financial banking crisis that you are so desperately trying to avoid by withdrawing your money, could be over. so, proceed with caution. withdrawing your money from the bank the best way to avoid getting your money caught in the bank in the midst of a bank run would be to not let the lion’s share of your money ever cross the bank. the simplest way to accomplish this is to prevent any form of deposit from going automatically into your account, as much as it is possible. secondly, you need to begin to pay cash for everything. let’s say that every 30 days, bob cashes his check at the bank from his work worth $5,000 net pay. bob leaves just enough in the bank to be able to conduct normal banking business. bob walks out of the bank every month with the majority of the cash from his check. bob should begin to pay cash for as much as he can, such as eating out, paying the electric bill (pay the bill in person), buying groceries, etc. when it becomes necessary to make a “big ticket” purchase, bob could temporarily leave more in the bank to cover the writing of a check. you would also be wise to open multiple banking accounts ranging from the big five megabanks to your local credit unions. you could withdraw much smaller amounts until the sum total of your accounts is greatly diminished and is in your possession. to open the accounts, simply write a personal check from your home bank. of course, in these cases, the bank could hold the check for 15-30 days. i cannot promise you that if you become the target of federal investigators, that you will not have your every financial move scrutinized and the feds will eventually discover the aggregate patterns of withdrawal. people who i interviewed told me that they believe that the federal government is in the process of getting the banking computers to “talk” to each other in a way that would reveal structuring, but that technology is not yet online. if you ever become the target of a federal investigation, do not, under any circumstances, allow yourself to be interviewed by federal officials without an attorney present. in many cases, people go to jail and pay huge fines, not because they have committed a federal crime, but because federal officials state that they have lied or misled them. and if you do not have an attorney present, it is your word versus the federal government. there are other sources besides banks that you can tap into for money which can be used to prepare for what is coming. 4o1k’s, ira, et al if you were 100% convinced of an imminent crash, you would be foolish not to take your money out. however, the prepayment penalty of 50% is steep if you withdraw your funds before you are 59.5 years old. if you are retiring soon, take the lump sum option and convert all of these retirement monies to survival supplies and gold which you will need as the world emerges from the crash. the moral of the story is to become as liquid as possible, from a cash perspective. getting access to your money is only the first part of being prepared to survive an economic crash. 3. make a list buy a good prepper book. holly deyo is an excellent source for this information (www.standdeyo.com). in the interim, procure your food, water, guns, ammo and home security adjustments. if you do not have a big dog, consider obtaining a pair. these animals will be your companion, home security system and ally if someone attempts to breach your home with bad intent. of course, you will have to store dog food as well. sit down and construct a list of what you will need after reading a good prepper book. make all of you purchases in cash! you do not want to let the wrong people know what you are up to. 4. rural vs. urban we have to live our lives for today and it may not be possible to move to a rural area because of your job. however, one survivalist that i was speaking with estimates that the rate of survival for a country in economic chaos would be 10 times higher for rural residents as opposed to urban residents. consider buying a place in an isolated area and commuting to work in the interim. 5. pay off your mortgage and car loans if you have a cd, a 401k or any other long-term investment, you might want to consider taking the penalty and executing a withdrawal and apply what’s left of the principal, usually about 50% of the original value, and paying down your major debts. after an economic collapse, you most likely will not have a job and your retirement and savings will likely be wiped out and confiscated. that is why it would be wise to pay down your debt while you can afford to do so because after the collapse, there will still be foreclosures and repossessions and if you and your family survive, you could be on the street if you cannot pay your bills. 6. buy gold and silver while you can afford it goldman sachs has been shorting gold. the elite have been hording gold as have the brics. these entities are telling you, by action, what medium of exchange is going to be of value following the collapse that is coming. storing gold and silver is an economic survival strategy which will pay dividends after the smoke begins to clear in the post-collapse era. 7. practice austerity before austerity is imposed on you it is critical to immediately eliminate all unnecessary expenses. give yourself some operating capital. you may be able to purchase a bug-out residence in a rural area. you will certainly be able to afford more survival gear. in order to increase your immediate cash flow, start an at-home business. start a business which has virtually no upfront and startup costs. even if you are not able to generate much income, you will create a legal tax evasion strategy in which you can legally deduct many of your present activities and expenses (e.g. mileage, the purchase of any office supply, etc.) including survival gear. 8. create and store your own food with regard to storing food, you need to do so immediately. i recommend storing two years worth of food. however, you need to master the art of growing food inside your home. there are plenty of resources which can teach you how to do that. however, you would be wise if you would create a hiding place in which you can store food and water safely in a hidden location . if you are ever robbed, you will not have exhausted your food supplies. you are most likely to be robbed by fema or one of their mercenary groups (e.g. academia) during the beginning of the crisis because food and water will be used as weapons to control you. i am personally aware of fema going to selected homeowners to catalogue their reserve food and water supplies. remember, water is sunlight and temperature sensitive. there are plenty of prepper manuals that you can consult for instructions on how to meet these needs. the time to do these things is yesterday. the biggest threat to survival is death due to dehydration and starving to death. contaminated water will also pose a threat. there are plenty of places to purchase large drums and obtain water tablets for water purification purposes. obtain a pair of water filters in case you have to go mobile to survive. finally, learn to grow your own food within your residence. your garden will likely be raided by humans and hungry animals alike. there are plenty of prepper manuals which can teach you how to accomplish this task. 9. personal supplies of course you will need toothpaste, toiletries, eating utensils, feminine hygiene supplies, etc. for a complete list of personal items see steve quayles list on his website . 10. horde medicines and medical supplies if you or your family has a chronic health condition, it is critical that you have 6 months to a year in medicine. also, you should research natural alternatives to treatment for health conditions in case you are not able to meet this goal due to the inability to obtain prescriptions. don’t forget to obtain some pain medication and antibiotics in case of unforeseen emergencies. make a trip to mexico and sneak across medication in old pill bottles in order to escape detection by the border patrol who will ask you if you obtained medication in mexico when you come back across the border. if you can safely ration your existing medication doses, do so and store the excesses. make sure you also have a first aid kit. take a first aid class including cpr at your local fire station. some are thinking that this is a lot of work. my response would be, how bad do you want you and your family to survive? 11. guns and ammunition regardless of your moral convictions, ask yourself if you want your family to survive. buy your guns off the books from private parties and at gun shows. “keep guns for show and guns for go”. in other words, have a safe location that you can bury guns so that when gun confiscation begins, you will not be left totally defenseless. america needs to not only create safe and secure homes, but to create as many warsaw ghettos as possible (look it up). we need to make ourselves a hard country to conquer and occupy. we cannot stop a treasonous leader from handing off the country to some foreign entity (e.g. the un). however, occupation of america should be problematic for the blue-helmet wearing russians, chinese and other proxy forces training on our soil to occupy us. it is recommended that you have 3 types of weapons: (1) pistols for close in fighting; (2) shotguns for defense of the entrance to your home; and, (3) a rifle with a scope in order to fight back against long-range snipers that do not want to storm your home because you appear to be prepared. immediately, obtain weapons instruction for you and your family, firearms training and then practice! conduct mock raids on your residence so that you can see your vulnerabilities. an armed populace makes a people more feared by an abusive government. do not forget about gas masks for each member of your family and make sure to store extras. if you have the means to obtain body armor, do so now, because congress is preparing to outlaw the private use of body armor. 12. prepare to survive in the raw elements and build a way of life it is possible that you can learn to survive in the raw elements without heating and central air conditioning. you may not have lights. obtain flashlights, many batteries and a hand crank radio. make sure you have clothes befitting all weather that you may encounter because a crisis that begins in january, may not be over by august. take a weekend and pretend the grid is down. this will allow you to see firsthand what supplies you will need. when should you perform this drill? there is no time like the present. to people with generators, congratulations on your foresight. however, if you are the only house on the block with lights, how long do you think it will be until you have unwanted visitors with bad intent? get in shape, begin to walk, jog or run. the better shape you are in, the better. don’t forget about procuring non-electronic forms of entertainment. this should include board games and educational materials for your children. you will want to establish some normalcy for the sake of your children. you are preparing to adopt a new way of life. make the new life worth living. i would also recommend that every personal library contain the constitution of the united states. after the chaos subsides, we will need to rebuild. you will not want to live in a “might makes right” society. 13. for goodness sake, do not tell anyone if your four adjacent neighbors broach the topic of preparedness, gauge the situation and then make an informed decision. if your neighbors are on board with preparing, that will help you form a defensive perimeter and a mutual alliance pact. otherwise, tell nobody of your preparation plans. do not tell your friends, family members, and co-workers. make your preparations in cash or cashier’s checks as much as possible. limit the paper trail to you. you do not want the government to know that you are prepared because you could be the first one on your block that is visited at 3am. you and your mate should prepare in stealth. kids talk and so do their friends. 14. pray! survival is never guaranteed, salvation is! and do not forget one of your most important resources, your bible. in a post-collapse america, it is likely that a religion will be forced upon the survivors and that religion will not be christianity. conclusion in an upside-down world in which the banks legally own your money, getting your money away from these criminal banks has become an art form. i cannot promise you that you will be able to retrieve all of your assets. however, i can promise you that if you do not act, you will lose everything and you will lack needed supplies to weather what is coming. i would strongly suggest that you keep your gas tank filled and you have plenty of cash, food and ammunition on hand. it is better to be safe than sorry. breaking news: fbi investigation reopens the elite may be pulling their support for hillary. she is, again, under investigation by the fbi. if her plug is pulled, the violence may come

vicious trump fans send bloodcurdling threats to california mosques in boldest move yet,"several mosques in california have received threatening letters from some of trump s loyal subjects, which boldly proclaim that trump is going to clean up america starting with muslims. they want him to, in their own words, do to you muslims what hitler did to the jews [sic]. the letters were addressed to the children of satan, and just got worse from there: your day of reckoning has arrived, the letter states, according to cair-la. there s a new sheriff in town president donald trump. he s going to cleanse america and make it shine again. and, he s going to start with you muslims. perhaps they think trump will be happy to deputize them in whatever crusade he launches against muslims, and, well, pretty much everyone who isn t obviously white.this group is signing these letters as, americans for a better way, because of course that s what they think they are.this is part of the rash of hate incidents and crimes that have occurred at the hands of trumpkins since the nov. 8 election. in fact, the southern poverty law center says that there had been more than 700 recorded hate incidents and crimes between the election and nov. 18. that s more than seventy such incidents per day, compared to a little more than two anti-trump incidents per day. and it s disgusting. it s terrifying.the counsel for american-islamic relations in l.a. came forward with the letters that went to two mosques there after they learned that a mosque in northern california had likewise gotten one. executive director hassam alyoush said: [people at the mosques are] disheartened that anyone would address fellow americans, fellow human beings, in such a hateful, dehumanizing way.you always want to trust that most people are good, that your neighbors have been good, and that has been our experience. sadly, for a growing number of people, believing that people are generally good is going to become a relic of the past if this keeps up. while cair and other organizations recognize that trump didn t create racism (and neither did obama), he did normalize it. he made it okay. he vindicated the lunatic fringe and now they re trying to work their way into mainstream dialogue. ayloush said the irresponsible, hateful rhetoric of the trump campaign has fueled a level of vulgarity, vile hatred and anger among many self-proclaimed trump supporters.' we can expect more mosques to receive letters like this (or worse), even as police in california begin investigating these incidents and stepping up protection where it s needed. trump spends an awful lot of time railing against the media and against democrats and his enemies, but he needs to rail against this. otherwise he s truly the president of hate.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.633846153846157,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0

juba gripped by renewed violence as factions clash in south sudan - the new york times,"juba, south sudan — armed clashes between two factions and waves of heavy gunfire spread across south sudan’s capital on sunday, a day after the nation’s fifth anniversary of its independence. military helicopters swooped over the city, juba, and armored vehicles rolled through streets, witnesses said. people took shelter in their homes and hid beneath their beds as the sounds of guns and heavier weapons rose, fell and rose again. “we are fighting at gudele, rock city and jebel,” said william gatjiath deng, a spokesman for vice president riek machar, referring to neighborhoods and suburbs of juba. “there are a lot of bodies. i can’t even count them. ” each side blamed the other for initiating the new outburst of violence. michael makuei, south sudan’s information minister, said president salva kiir would soon declare a “unilateral . ” the united nations peacekeeping mission in the country wrote on twitter that a “heavily armed exchange” had occurred near its base around 8:30 a. m. “the heavy artillery has been continuing since morning,” shantal persaud, a spokeswoman for the mission, said late sunday afternoon. “the civilians have not been able to move from our accommodation” at the mission’s base near jebel. even as people sought refuge in their homes, witnesses reported that officers were knocking on doors in some neighborhoods, checking identity cards. the renewed violence broke a short and uneasy calm on saturday, after fighting had erupted friday. that violence is reported to have killed at least 150 people, with the toll expected to rise because casualties were still being counted. factions of the south sudanese army loyal to mr. kiir and those backing mr. machar, who until this year led a rebellion against the government, have been fighting throughout the capital since thursday, when the two sides confronted each other at a roadside checkpoint. five government soldiers were killed in those exchanges. fighting broke out again the next day as the two leaders were meeting. the united states said it had met with representatives of the south sudanese leadership on saturday and had received assurances that the fighting would stop. the united states helped engineer south sudan’s independence from sudan and still wields influence in the country. on sunday, however, gunfire erupted again, spreading to different parts of the capital, including near the main army barracks and juba international airport. in new york, the united nations security council scheduled an emergency meeting on sunday afternoon to address the south sudan crisis, the council announced on twitter. in an email, j. peter pham, the director of the africa center at the atlantic council in washington, said it was unclear how much sway mr. kiir and mr. machar and other faction leaders in the “ transition government” had over their fighters. “between the collapse of oil prices and the destruction they themselves wrought in the civil war, south sudan is so destitute that there are no resources with which the country’s rulers might employ to bring their followers to heel,” mr. pham said.",0,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.780000000000001,8.666666666666668,0.0,0.0
nc school district fights to keep pro-transgender message in first-grade curriculum - breitbart,"public pressure has forced officials at the school district (cms) to withdraw a book for kids — but the officials are now mandating a book with a disguised version of the same message. [a teacher raised concerns about the book, jacob’s new dress, at a school board meeting. the book celebrates a young boy who wears dresses to school, and it stigmatizes boys who urge their peers to wear boys’ clothes. after lawmakers in raleigh heard the concerns, the book was removed from the “ ” curriculum — but it was replaced with red: a crayon’s story, which focuses on a red crayon that believes itself to be blue, reports wfxb. but both books are included in the campaign known as welcoming schools by the lgbt advocacy group human rights campaign, an effort to help elementary schools become “ ” and “ . ” according to the amazon review, the red: a crayon’s story book “can be read at any levels. ” the review says: red has a bright red label, but he is, in fact, blue. his teacher tries to help him be red (let’s draw strawberries!) his mother tries to help him be red by sending him out on a playdate with a yellow classmate (go draw a nice orange!) and the scissors try to help him be red by snipping his label so that he has room to breathe. but red is miserable. he just can’t be red, no matter how hard he tries! finally, a friend offers a perspective, and red discovers what readers have known all along. he’s blue! this funny, heartwarming, colorful picture book about finding the courage to be true to your inner self can be read on multiple levels, and it offers something for everyone. also, amazon shows the two books are often bought by the same buyers and are matched with sales of a book about a boy who wants to be a girl named “jazz. ” other books, including “toni the tampon,” push the same transgender claim that a person’s sex is changeable, regardless of biology. “the purpose of our elementary schools is to teach writing, reading, and arithmetic, not to encourage boys to wear dresses,” tami fitzgerald, executive director of nc values coalition, said in a statement. “i read the book online,” she told the new york times. “it’s clearly geared to young children. the book is meant as a tool of indoctrination to normalize transgender behavior. i think a lot of parents would object to that. ” schools should be focused on helping young children to achieve the building blocks of learning, not indoctrinating them in progressive social values, she said in her statement: cms is failing our children in the recent 2016 state academic ratings, 43 of 165 cms schools achieved overall pass rates below 50% and a majority (59%) earned a grade of c or below when measuring student proficiency and growth. these lessons found in the book, jacob’s new dress and my princess boy and other transgender curriculum are not appropriate for any child whose parents support traditional family values. there is no question that this attempt by cms staff to mandated training is nothing more than putting a dress on cms’s gender unicorn. we encourage cms to refocus on their mission of maximizing academic achievement instead of advancing this controversial curriculum. the “gender unicorn” message tells children that sexual attitudes can be chosen, diverse and fluid, despite the risk of derailing some children’s normal maturation into healthy and stable young men and young women. the cms school board is currently preparing to add sexual orientation and “gender ” to its policy on multiculturalism, reports the charlotte observer, along with such things as race, religion and national origin. “the proposed new policy … calls for cms to “intentionally incorporate diversity throughout the curriculum, instruction and professional development,” says the report. fitzgerald continued: as charlotte’s city council passed an outrageous ordinance last year that made it necessary for the state to correct the mistake with hb2, schools was working on rolling out a new policy that seeks to indoctrinate students in the school district by normalizing transgender behavior. both charlotte’s ordinance and the cms transgender indoctrination were advanced by the human rights campaign, a national lgbt activist group, in conjunction with its nc affiliates, equality nc and time out youth. they provided the curriculum, the training, and the lesson plans for mandated transgender training for our children, complete with the gender unicorn, all while the bank of america funded the program and the groups that support it. last year, the charlotte city council passed the ordinance that allowed anyone who simply declared they had changed their gender to use the restrooms and locker rooms of the opposite sex. the ordinance was pushed forward by registered sex offender chad and national groups during the tenure of mayor jennifer roberts. former gov. pat mccrory (r) however, signed the hb2 privacy and public safety bill into law to nullify the charlotte ordinance. hb2 required people to use the bathroom that matched the official documentation of their sex. the documents could be their original birth certificate, or a modified birth certificate after surgical changes, so allowing people who want to live as members of other sex to use bathrooms reserved for the other sex. following the passage of hb2, progressive groups pushed major universities, sports organizations, businesses, and celebrities to boycott the state. the resulting boycotts helped the state’s establishment media to portray the law as an economic hazard. in general, gay groups opposed the hb2 law because they seek to blur the social and legal recognition of the two male and female sexes. in general, transgender and gay groups opposed the hb2 law because they want to blur the social and legal recognition of the two male and female sexes. the overall goal is to get government support for the “transgender ideology,” which says that americans should sacrifice their institutions — such as bathrooms, sports leagues, women’s shelters, and normal practices — to validate the relatively few people who want to live as members of the other sex. groups and their progressive political allies are trying to shape the early development of children, but are being rejected by the public and resisted by mainstream professional and groups. to learn more about the

memo to congress: bring back earmarks!,"written by daniel mcadams thursday november 17, 2016 one of the essential battles in the effort to move toward a more peaceful and prosperous united states is the effort to restore the proper balance among the three branches of our government. the rapid concentration of power in the executive branch has led to more wars with less congressional oversight, trampling of our civil liberties with no resistance from our representatives, and out of control military spending. contrary to what many people believe, the congressional ability to earmark spending to specific projects was an important function of the legislative branch. when earmarks were abolished, spending did not decrease. it was just hidden. we discuss the need for their return in today's liberty report: copyright © 2016 by ronpaul institute. permission to reprint in whole or in part is gladly granted, provided full credit and a live link are given.",1,6,0.0,1,0,0,0.0,4.450000000000003,2.4000000000000004,0.0,0.0
syrian government to blame for april sarin attack: u.n. report,"united nations (reuters) - the syrian government of bashar al-assad is to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of khan sheikhoun that killed dozens of people last april, according to a report sent to the united nations security council on thursday. the syrian arab republic is responsible for the release of sarin at khan sheikhoun on 4 april 2017, the report from the u.n. and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons joint investigative mechanism (jim) said. the attack prompted a u.s. missile strike against a syrian air base which washington said was used to launch the strike. time and again, we see independent confirmation of chemical weapons use by the assad regime, nikki haley, the united states u.n. ambassador, said in a statement. the security council must send a clear message that the use of chemical weapons by anyone will not be tolerated, and must fully support the work of the impartial investigators. the report also said isis was to blame for the use of sulfur mustard in the syrian town of umm hawsh on sept. 15 and 16, 2016. the jim was unanimously created by the 15-member u.n. security council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. its mandate is due to expire in mid-november, and russia on tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate. russian ambassador to the u.n. vassily nebenzia said earlier this week russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after thursday s report is discussed. speaking in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said china hopes that the conclusions of any investigation have a basis in conclusive proof and are professional, objective and fair. the continuing use of chemical weapons, including by non-state actors, is deeply disturbing, said the report. if such use, in spite of the prohibition by the international community, is not stopped now, a lack of consequences will surely encourage others to follow. the jim has already found syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015. syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by russia and the united states. the syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the country s more than six-year civil war.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.55,8.0,0.1,0.0

"hillary responds to bernie calling her unqualified, and it’s kinda perfect","it seems there s a bit of infighting happening between the democratic candidates that really isn t called for. while hillary clinton was pressed to say if she thought bernie sanders is qualified to be president, she time and time again has said that it s up to the voters to decide, but has never said he s not qualified. yet, this seemingly was taken as an attack and bernie responded in slight, and it kind of goes against his promise to run a clean campaign.sanders, quite literally said, i don t believe that she is qualified, in regards to clinton. he then went on to list reasons he believes she s not qualified, all of which were just positions he just disagrees with her on, but not a means of disqualification. if anything, clinton may be the most qualified candidate in modern history, so his remarks were clearly uncalled for.while the internet went into a tizzy slamming sanders for saying clinton is unqualified, everyone was waiting for what the democratic front-runner would say in response.speaking with reporters thursday morning, clinton, being no beginner in receiving uncalled for jabs, shrugged off the attack, saying: well, it s kind of a silly thing to say. but i m going to trust the voters of new york who know me and have voted for me three times twice for senate and once in the presidential primary. adding: look, i don t know why he s saying that, but i will take bernie sanders over donald trump or ted cruz any time, so let s keep our eye on what s really at stake in this election. reiterating that as far as new york is concerned, that s up to the voters. the voters will decide that. clinton could have gone negative, but she chose to take the high road and reiterate that if bernie happens to take the nomination, he s a far better choice than anything the republicans have to offer. something sanders used to say himself about hillary.this is what every democrat voting needs to remember, all this bickering back and forth will amount to nothing if a republican wins in november. both hillary and bernie are far better options, and that is clear. please remember, no matter who, vote blue.featured photo by andrew renneisen/getty images",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.15384615384615385,11.22727272727273,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0

trump to nominate former senate aide peirce for sec commissioner,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump intends to nominate former senate republican aide hester maria peirce to be a member of the securities and exchange commission, the white house said on tuesday. peirce is a former senate banking committee staff member and currently is the director of the financial markets working group at george mason university’s mercatus center. she was nominated to the sec last year by president barack obama, but the full senate never acted on her nomination. democrats on the senate banking committee attempted to block her nomination when she declined to fully commit to work as a commissioner on requiring corporations to publicly disclose their political donations. she ultimately won the committee’s blessing but her nomination stalled in the senate as republicans dragged their feet on approving names put forward by obama, a democrat. peirce could face a rocky time again in the chamber. liberal firebrand senator elizabeth warren is highly critical of peirce, who is a member of the federalist society, an organization of conservative and libertarian lawyers. peirce could be instrumental in carrying out trump’s plan to reform regulations imposed after the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession. she recently edited and contributed to a book published by the right-leaning mercatus center that called for totally restructuring the country’s financial regulation. peirce would fill one of two vacancies on the five-member commission. if trump follows tradition, he will suggest a democrat for the other open slot at the top u.s. securities regulator. columbia university law professor robert jackson is a leading contender to fill the democratic slot, people familiar with the matter said last month.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,12.0,0.0,0.0
constitutional law expert: comey did not violate law by announcing email investigation,"senate minority leader harry reid alleges that fbi director comey has violated the law by announcing the re-opened investigation into clinton emails so close to the presidential election. is he right? one of the top constitutional law experts in the united states (and a liberal), professor jonathan turley, says no : [reid’s] allegation is in my view wildly misplaced. reid is arguing that the actions of fbi director james b. comey violates the hatch act . i cannot see a plausible, let alone compelling, basis for such a charge against comey. in his letter to comey, reid raised the the hatch act, which prohibits partisan politicking by government employees. 5 u.s.c. § 7323(a)(1) prohibits a government employee from “us[ing] his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.” reid argued: “your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act, which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election. through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.” the reference to “months” is curious. comey has kept congress informed in compliance with oversight functions of the congressional committees but has been circumspect in the extent of such disclosures. it is troubling to see democrats (who historically favor both transparency and checks on executive powers) argue against such disclosure and cooperation with oversight committees. more importantly, the hatch act is simply a dog that will not hunt. richard w. painter, a law professor at the university of minnesota and the chief ethics lawyer in the george w. bush white house from 2005 to 2007, has filed a hatch act complaint against comey with the federal office of special counsel and office of government ethics. he argues that “we cannot allow f.b.i. or justice department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway.” however, comey was between the horns of a dilemma. he could be accused of acts of commission in making the disclosure or omission in withholding the disclosure in an election year. quite frankly, i found painter’s justification for his filing remarkably speculative. he admits that he has no evidence to suggest that comey wants to influence the election or favors either candidate . intent is key under the hatch investigations. you can disagree with the timing of comey’s disclosure, but that is not a matter for the hatch act or even an ethical charge in my view. congress passed the hatch act in response to scandals during the 1938 congressional elections and intended the act to bar federal employees from using “[their] official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.” comey is not doing that in communicating with congress on a matter of oversight. such violations under the hatch act, even if proven, are not criminal matters . the office of special counsel -can investigate such matters and seek discipline — a matter than can ultimately go before the merit systems protection board. cnn confirms : violators aren’t going to jail: the hatch act is not a criminal statute. instead, it is an administrative constraint on government employees. the law is enforced by a special independent federal agency — the office of special counsel — which is charged with investigating complaint allegations and, where found to be meritorious, either pursuing a settlement with the offending employee or prosecuting their case before the federal agency that oversees internal employment disputes — the merit systems protection board. and for presidential appointees like comey, the office of special counsel submits a report of its findings along with the employee’s response to the president , who makes a decision on whether discipline is warranted . *** the hatch act provision most commonly invoked in discussions of comey’s letter is 5 u.s.c. § 7323(a)(1), which prohibits a government employee from “us[ing] his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.” the key text is the emphasized phrase — which conditions a violation of the statute on whether the employee’s purpose was to interfere with or affect the result of an election. thus, the hatch act does not focus on the effect of the employee’s conduct, but the intent. to that end, if comey did not intend to interfere with or affect the upcoming election through his letter to congress, then he did not violate the letter of the hatch act.",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.656666666666666,18.133333333333336,0.0,0.0

"richmond fed president resigns, admitting he violated confidentiality - the new york times","washington — jeffrey m. lacker, the president of the federal reserve bank of richmond in virginia, resigned abruptly on tuesday, saying that he had broken the fed’s rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about confidential deliberations. mr. lacker said he also failed to disclose the details of the conversation even when he was questioned directly in an internal investigation. the confession and resignation shed light on a nearly mystery. in october 2012, medley global advisors, a firm that tracks policy developments for financial investors, sent a note to its clients describing previously undisclosed details of the fed’s plans for a new phase in its campaign. the information was potentially valuable to investors, who could have made money by anticipating the market’s reaction when the fed’s plans were publicly disclosed. the fed conducted an inconclusive investigation into the source of the leak. the commodity futures trading commission opened an insider trading investigation and referred the matter to the united states attorney’s office in manhattan, which then began a criminal investigation, two people briefed on the matter said. but the investigation stalled in the past couple of years, one of the people said. as the various government authorities sought to resolve the matter, negotiations heated up about six weeks ago. the statute of limitations on the case was due to expire in the fall. mr. lacker decided to announce his resignation after being told by the authorities that they had completed their investigation into his role, a lawyer representing him said. “dr. lacker has cooperated with the department of justice and has been informed that no charges will be brought and that the investigation as to him is complete,” said the lawyer, richard cullen, a partner at mcguirewoods. (mr. lacker has a doctorate in economics from the university of wisconsin.) the fed’s office of the inspector general said tuesday that its investigation also was now complete. it is not clear whether any other investigations are in progress. the episode occurred after the fed said in september 2012 that it would begin to accumulate mortgage bonds until job growth improved substantially, a new chapter in its campaign to stimulate economic growth in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. on oct. 3, a day before the fed released an account of its deliberations, regina schleiger, a medley analyst, sent a note to clients saying the fed was likely to announce in december that it would buy treasuries too. the note also said that fed officials were considering a statement that the central bank would not raise interest rates before the unemployment rate fell below a threshold of 6. 5 percent. the information was accurate and valuable. on the day ms. schleiger published her memo, the yield on the benchmark treasury was 1. 61 percent. after the fed’s official account was published the next day, the benchmark yield rose to 1. 74 percent on the day. investors who saw the memo — titled “fed: december bound” — could have profited by anticipating that movement. mr. lacker said tuesday in his statement — issued by mcguirewoods rather than the richmond fed — that he had not provided any confidential information about the fed’s deliberations to ms. schleiger, whom he did not name. instead, he said that ms. schleiger mentioned the information and that he had failed to make clear that he could not comment. the next day, after seeing ms. schleiger’s memo, mr. lacker said, “i realized that my failure to decline comment on the information could have been taken by the analyst, in the context of the conversation, as an acknowledgment or confirmation of the information. ” he added, “i deeply regret the role i may have played. ” after the leak, the c. f. t. c. pursued an investigation under its “eddie murphy rule. ” this rule was a nod to mr. murphy’s 1983 movie “trading places,” which humorously exposed the legality of insider trading in commodities. in 2010, the act adopted some restrictions on federal employees intentionally providing nonpublic government information to help other people trade in certain markets. yet the investigation stalled as the agency and manhattan federal prosecutors were unable to serve a subpoena on medley because it considers itself to be a news organization, the people briefed on the matter said. the justice department generally avoids issuing subpoenas to news organizations. separate from the insider trading rules, the fed had announced a new policy in 2011 restricting contact between policy makers and market intelligence firms like medley, which traded on the perception that analysts had access to inside information. officials were instructed to avoid conversations that might contribute to such impressions. mr. lacker said tuesday that in speaking with ms. schleiger he may have violated this policy, too, regardless of the contents of the conversation. he acknowledged speaking with her multiple times. mr. lacker, 61, was the member of the fed’s committee. he became president of the richmond fed in august 2004. he had previously announced that he planned to resign in october. the richmond fed said it would continue to search for a new president, and that its first vice president, mark l. mullinix, would lead the bank in the interim. mr. lacker was not a voting member of the fed’s policy committee this year. the fed has sought to limit leaks in recent years both by sharing more information with the public and by tightening its communications policies. in a statement, the fed said, “we appreciate the diligent efforts made to bring this matter to its conclusion. ”",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.07142857142857142,15.64,18.133333333333336,0.0,0.0
beyond syria and iraq: isis is losing ground around the world,"libyan fighters are celebrating a major victory on tuesday: they've driven isis out of parts of benghazi, eastern libya's largest city, building on advances in and around the city on sunday. isis isn't just losing in benghazi. in its home base in syria and iraq, it's lost up to 30 percent of its territory from its peak in august 2014. and it's tried expanding abroad, officially declaring a wilayat — which literally means ""province"" and refers to isis's foreign franchises — in roughly a dozen countries. these isis franchises showed some initial successes, for example in libya, but since mid-2015 they have been struggling. many of isis's wilayat have stopped growing and begun shrinking. some isis affiliates have been wiped out altogether. ""the islamic state has encountered one serious obstacle after another as it has tried to expand its presence beyond syria and iraq,"" daveed gartenstein-ross, a fellow with the foundation for defense of democracies and ceo of the consulting firm valens global, writes with threat analyst nathaniel barr in war on the rocks on tuesday. ""these stumbles have gone largely unnoticed by the international media."" gartenstein-ross and barr examined seven isis expansion attempts and found that each had serious problems. in every case, the isis franchise they looked at has either suffered a major battlefield defeat, had members targeted and killed in significant numbers by rival jihadist groups, or was defeated outright. ""overall, [isis] is having significant troubles expanding. joining isil can be a fatal decision,"" gartenstein-ross told me, using another name for isis. the first example he pointed to was a group called the islamic movement in uzbekistan (imu). imu is a decades-old jihadist group with ties to the taliban and al-qaeda. in august, it formally pledged itself to isis, working with the already-established afghanistan-based isis franchise. over the course of the next several months, the taliban, once imu's ally, sought out and killed imu fighters in a targeted campaign aimed at destroying the group. this culminated in a november purge, wherein the taliban killed 100 imu fighters and allegedly captured its leader, wiping out the group entirely. ""what america and its agents could not do in 14 years, the taliban did in 24 hours,"" one imu supporter tweeted at the time. isis's troubles in algeria are, if anything, more dramatic. the group officially recognized a wilayat there, largely made up of former al-qaeda fighters, in 2014. in october 2014, isis's algerian branch captured a french mountain climber and beheaded him on tape. the beheading attracted the attention of algerian security forces, which shortly thereafter killed the group's leader. later, in may 2015, algerian forces killed five isis commanders and the overwhelming majority of its ground fighters in two days of fighting. today, gartenstein-ross says, isis in algeria is a ""paper wilayat,"" with only six or seven fighters to its name. isis's yemen wilayat is in even worse shape. you'd think yemen would be the perfect opportunity for isis: it has no functional government and is in the midst of a civil war with major sectarian overtones. but the group has been riven by public infighting; gartenstein-ross and barr documented roughly 100 defections in the past several months — out of a force estimated to be at most 1,000, and possibly much less. ""this outfit in yemen is not very strong,"" will mccants, director of the project on us relations with the islamic world at the brookings institution, tells me. ""they're, at the moment, a pretty bit player in that conflict."" even relatively powerful isis franchises are having problems. the libya branch lost its hold on the libyan city of derna in december, pushed out by a coalition of rival militant groups. today, it controls only one major population center — the town of sirte — and about 173 miles of coastal territory. ""in libya, where they're strongest, they only control a thin strip along the coast,"" mccants says. ""it's not nothing, but it's not nearly as impressive as what they control in syrian and iraq."" these cases, according to gartenstein-ross and barr, are representative of isis's struggles to expand beyond iraq and syria. ""the group has stumbled or even fallen flat in almost every country where it has tried to establish a new wilayat,"" gartenstein-ross and barr write. ""the group’s failures as it tries to expand beyond syria and iraq could cast doubt on its entire global caliphate project."" isis's struggles to expand reveal some major weaknesses inherent in the group's ""dna,"" as gartenstein-ross puts it, that limit its efforts to expand. first, the group makes enemies out of other jihadist groups. its ideological and strategic model depends on its claim to be the prophesied islamic caliphate and its ability to prove that claim by holding territory. other militant groups, in isis's mind, must submit to isis and hand over their territory — or be destroyed. ""that's a constant — they don't play well [with others],"" mccants says. this leads to conflict with other jihadist groups such as al-qaeda and the taliban, which perceive isis as a threat and so move to crush new franchises as they're forming. this is particularly problematic for isis because it thrives most in civil wars with sectarian elements — places where other jihadist groups already operate. ""derna was always gonna be a tough nut to crack, because that's jihadist central in libya,"" mccants says. ""aqap [al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula] has long roots in yemen, and has been more successful in exploiting the chaos."" second, isis's showiness — the penchant for ghoulish murders and slick social media — can attract the attention of enemies before isis is really ready to take them on. ""that's one of the things that got them into trouble in algeria,"" gartenstein-ross says. ""the ostentatious beheading of [the french mountain climber] drew counterinsurgent resources down on them in a way that they weren't ready for."" finally, isis is, weirdly enough, too top-down and bureaucratic. it isn't very good at selecting leaders who work well with locals or mediating internal, local disputes in its franchises. ""despite their rebellious nature, they're a very rigid organization internally,"" gartenstein-ross explains. ""in yemen, the central leadership ended up contributing to that branch falling apart under the weight of a leader that the isil members don't agree with."" despite isis's defeats in the libyan cities of benghazi and derna, the group is still deeply entrenched in sirte — and getting a number of new recruits. its egypt branch has withstood repeated assaults from the egyptian government and has managed to pull off a number of high-profile terrorist attacks. and that's to say nothing of boko haram, which pledged itself to isis last year and is now recognized as wilayat nigeria. ""around january 2015, when i finished the first draft of [my isis] book, it was laughable,"" mccants says of the franchises. ""then when i had to go back and revise four months later, i had to completely change the section. in that short time, they had made such a rapid advance. they've gotten stronger since then."" so the point is not to dismiss the franchises entirely. rather, it's to recognize that they are not, as is often portrayed in the media, a sign of isis sweeping across the globe. it's an attempt by a terrorist group with very serious problems to try to create some breathing room outside of its troubled core holdings. isis thrives on a narrative of victory. now that the group's defeats in iraq and syria are too numerous and prominent for anyone to reasonably deny, the group has increasingly turned to the franchises to continue selling its narrative of constant territorial growth. ""they have this narrative of momentum; it's clearly very important to drawing people to the group, drawing organizations to isis,"" gartenstein-ross says. ""this is an area of great vulnerability if [the truth] were widely known."" isis's affiliates help ""maintain the fiction that this is an empire on the march,"" mccants says. no matter how you judge the success of the franchises — and here, mccants is less optimistic than gartenstein-ross — both agree that any victories abroad don't come close to outweighing the losses the group has taken in iraq and syria.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,8.036363636363637,0.09090909090909091,0.0
brilliant move: mike rowe calls out liberal celebs when asked why he doesn’t use fame for ‘get out the vote’,"mike rowe of discovery channel s show dirty jobs took to facebook to answer a fan s request to encourage your huge following to go out and vote this election. jeremy schneider writes hey mike, i have nothing but respect for you. your no-nonsense outlook and incredible eloquence have really had a profound impact in my life. can you please encourage your huge following to go out and vote this election? i would never impose on you by asking you to advocate one politician over another, but i do feel this election could really use your help. i know that there are many people out there who feel like there is nothing they can do. please try to use your gifts to make them see that they can do something that their vote counts. hi jeremy thanks for the kind words. i appreciate it. i also share your concern for our country, and agree wholeheartedly that every vote counts. however, i m afraid i can t encourage millions of people whom i ve never met to just run out and cast a ballot, simply because they have the right to vote. that would be like encouraging everyone to buy an ar-15, simply because they have the right to bear arms. i would need to know a few things about them before offering that kind of encouragement. for instance, do they know how to care for a weapon? can they afford the cost of the weapon? do they have a history of violence? are they mentally stable? in short, are they responsible citizens? i would need to know a few things about them before offering that kind of encouragement, he told the reader. for instance, do they know how to care for a weapon? can they afford the cost of the weapon? do they have a history of violence? are they mentally stable? in short, are they responsible citizens? and responsibility is what it all comes down to. casting a ballot is not so different. it s an important right that we all share, and one that impacts our society in dramatic fashion. but it s one thing to respect and acknowledge our collective rights, and quite another thing to affirmatively encourage people i ve never met to exercise them. and yet, my friends in hollywood do that very thing, and they re at it again, he observed.he said that liberal celebrities urge their fans to get out and vote during every presidential election cycle, calling it our most important civic duty, noting that they speak as if the very act of casting a ballot is more important than the outcome of the election. calling those pleas somewhat hysterical, rowe said there s an ulterior motive behind them. does anyone actually believe that leonardo dicaprio, ellen degeneres, and ed norton would encourage the masses to vote, if they believed the masses would elect donald trump? he asked.he described voting as a right, not a duty, and not a moral obligation, which carries with it a responsibility on the part of the voter. but even the irresponsible are allowed to cast a ballot. if you believe aliens from another planet walk among us, you are welcome at the polls. if you believe the world is flat, and the moon landing was completely staged, you are invited to cast a ballot. astrologists, racists, ghost-hunters, sexists, and people who rely upon a magic 8 ball to determine their daily wardrobe are all allowed to participate. in fact, and to your point, they re encouraged. rowe reasoned that encouraging everyone to vote regardless of their mental state or knowledge of issues and current events is crazy. when they tell us that everybody in the country should get out there and vote, regardless of what they think or believe, i gotta wonder what they re smoking. read more: bpr",1,20,0.0,0,0,0,0.041666666666666664,6.960000000000001,10.0,0.0,0.0

"china gets an early win off trump, but many battles remain","beijing (reuters) - combining public bluster with behind-the-scenes diplomacy, china wrested a concession from the united states as the two presidents spoke for the first time this week, but beijing may not be able to derive much comfort from the win on u.s. policy toward taiwan. several areas of disagreement between the superpowers, including currency, trade, the south china sea and north korea, were not mentioned in public statements on thursday’s telephone conversation between presidents xi jinping and donald trump. in getting trump to change course on the “one china” policy, beijing may have overplayed its hand. trump had upset beijing before he took office by taking a call from taiwan president tsai ing-wen, then casting doubt on the “one china” policy, under which washington acknowledges the chinese position that there is only one china and taiwan is part of it. trump changed tack and agreed to honor the “one china” policy during the call, prompting jubilation in china. beijing had been working on diplomatic ways to engage trump’s team and largely blaming taiwan for stirring things up. [nl4n1fv21k] laying the foundation for that call had been the low-key engagement of china’s former ambassador to washington and top diplomat, the urbane and fluent english-speaking yang jiechi, with trump’s national security adviser michael flynn. “china was pragmatic and patient. it made every effort to smooth out the relationship, and it paid off,” said jia qingguo, dean of the school of international studies at peking university, who has advised the government on foreign policy. but china also made very clear taiwan was not up for negotiation, unleashing state media to threaten war and punishment for u.s. firms if that bottom line was breached. china has long described self-ruled taiwan, claimed by beijing as its sacred territory, as the most sensitive issue in sino-u.s. relations. its military had become alarmed after the trump-tsai call and was considering strong measures to prevent the island from moving toward independence, sources with ties to senior military officers told reuters in december. [nl4n1es0vr] a source familiar with china’s thinking on relations with the united states, speaking to reuters last month, said china had actually not been too bothered with trump’s taiwan comments before he took office as he was not president then and was only expressing his personal view. “if he continues with this once he becomes president then there’s no saying what we’ll do,” the source said. despite the u.s. concession, military tensions remain. on saturday, the overseas edition of the ruling communist party’s people’s daily placed a picture on its front page of chinese warships about to embark on a new round of drills in the south china sea, right next to an upbeat commentary about the xi-trump call. the paper’s wechat account took a harsher line, saying that with trump getting back with the program on “one china”, taiwan had better watch out. “the heart of that madame tsai on the other side of the taiwan strait must at this moment be chilled to the core,” it said. one senior western diplomat said china had been redoubling its efforts to win over the vatican, one of a handful of countries to retain official ties with taiwan. taiwan says it hopes for continued u.s. support, and one ruling democratic progressive party official told reuters that the “one china” policy had not affected previous u.s. arms sales to taiwan, even as u.s. presidents’ commitment to the island have waxed and waned. xi has put great personal political capital into seeking a solution over taiwan, an issue that has festered since 1949 when defeated nationalist forces fled to the island after losing the civil war to the communists. china has never renounced the use of force to bring taiwan under its control. but in its relations with washington, the risk for beijing remains that its diplomatic win over “one china” will be short lived, as trump will not want to be seen as having caved in. “what he’s shown the chinese is he’s willing to touch the ‘third rail’ of u.s.-china relations,” said dean cheng, china expert at the conservative heritage foundation in washington. “beijing can’t predict what he’ll do next – and he’s only been in office three weeks. what is he going to do on trade and other economic issues?” u.s. officials said the affirmation of the “one china” policy was an effort to get the relationship back on track and moving forward. [nl1n1fv1ru] but trump’s change of tack may be seen by beijing as a climbdown, said tom rafferty, the china regional manager for the economist intelligence unit. “mr trump is erratic and will not appreciate the suggestion that he has been weak.”",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.863636363636363,4.4,0.0,0.0

"fair elections in poland at risk from ruling party bill, opposition says","warsaw (reuters) - a bill sponsored by poland s ruling law and justice (pis) party will undermine the fairness of elections, opposition deputies said in parliament on thursday. the proposal would introduce live web feeds from polling stations, but also replace all current members of the state electoral commission, a body responsible for conducting and overseeing elections, as well as all election commissioners, giving political parties more say in naming new ones. the pis has said its bill would make voting more transparent, but critics said the real aim is to boost the electoral prospects of the party, which has been accused by the european commission of eroding democratic standards. this bill is a thuggish project. this is a mine placed under elections in poland, the head of opposition psl party, wladyslaw kosiniak-kamysz said in parliament. the socially conservative pis, in power since late 2015, is already at loggerheads with fellow members of the european union over its push to bring the courts and state media under more direct government control, as well as over migration. according to the 72-page long amendment that did not undergo any public consultations, seven of the nine members of the state electoral commission would be chosen by parliament for 9-year terms, with pis set to directly appoint three members and the remaining parties four. the remaining two members would be judges chosen by the head of the constitutional tribunal and the supreme administrative court. pis deputies have already appointed the head of the tribunal following changes in the law that opposition parties said violated the constitution, a charge pis denies. the changes proposed in the bill will destabilize the election system and are a serious threat to the effective carrying out of the local elections in 2018, the state election commission said in a statement last week. head of the commission wojciech hermelinski said on thursday the amendment would also give an advantage to political parties at the expense of independent candidates. the bill would require the newly-chosen commission to appoint nearly 400 election commissioners within 60 days of the bill coming into force, removing the requirement for the commissioners to be independent from political parties. lawmakers are expected to initially vote on the bill early on friday. if finally passed by the pis-dominated parliament, the bill would still have to be signed into law by president andrzej duda, who could potentially veto it.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.756666666666668,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0
trump vs. congress: now what? - the new york times,"on monday, jan. 9, less than two weeks before president trump’s inauguration, the house speaker, paul ryan, hosted a dinner at his office in the capitol with members of trump’s inner circle. the guests included the ’s chief white house strategist, stephen k. bannon his and family consigliere, jared kushner his chief of staff, reince priebus his economic adviser, gary cohn his nominee for treasury secretary, steven mnuchin his incoming deputy chief of staff, rick dearborn and his director, marc short. the ostensible purpose of the dinner was to discuss the details of trump’s legislative agenda — in particular, the prospects for a sweeping measure that republicans, and especially ryan, have been coveting for the past decade. it was hoped that the dinner could also establish some sort of common ground between ryan and bannon, the two figures who would arguably wield the greatest influence over how trump’s campaign promises became law — or didn’t. ryan was a fixture among establishment republicans even before joining mitt romney’s presidential ticket in 2012, his previous labors on the house budget committee cementing his reputation as the wizard of fiscal conservatism. bannon, by contrast, was a renegade autodidact who read plato and had seemingly materialized from nowhere to become the intellectual architect of trump’s campaign and, later, administration. up to this point, ryan had epitomized to bannon everything that was wrong with the republican party. discussing the two parties’ shortcomings, bannon later told me, “what’s that dostoyevsky line: happy families are all the same, but unhappy families are unhappy in their own unique ways?” (he meant tolstoy.) “i think the democrats are fundamentally afflicted with the inability to discuss and have an adult conversation about economics and jobs, because they’re too consumed by identity politics. and then the republicans, it’s all this theoretical cato institute, austrian economics, limited government — which just doesn’t have any depth to it. they’re not living in the real world. ” breitbart news, the media outlet bannon ran before becoming the chief executive of the trump campaign in august, had described ryan, referring to his position on immigration, as “arguably the most g. o. p. lawmaker in congress” — an apostasy of nearly impeachable proportions from bannon’s perspective. worst of all, ryan all but abandoned trump during the 2016 campaign. after the leak in october of the damaging “access hollywood” tape, ryan told fellow republican house members on a conference call, “i am not going to defend donald trump — not now, not in the future. ” a republican lawmaker on the call told trump what ryan had said, yet another reason for bannon to regard himself as ryan’s worst enemy. but as the dinner progressed, it became clear that bannon and ryan actually had some ideas in common. over memorably bad chicken parmesan, ryan described his vision for a “ tax,” which would levy taxes on imports while offering exemptions for exports. his tax package would include “immediate expensing,” he explained, in which capital expenditures would be written off against profits in the first year rather than over time. it also would abolish the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. these were ideas ryan had been pushing since 2008. now they had bannon’s attention. taken together with a drastic reduction in corporate taxes, bannon believed, ryan’s scheme would spur a renaissance of a export economy, producing labor in keeping with trump’s populism. “i would actually say,” bannon remembers observing admiringly, “that this tax reform comes as close to a first step of economic nationalism as there is. ” “i would call it ‘responsible nationalism,’’u2009” ryan said, according to bannon. bannon laughed. “you’re going to have a lot of folks in the senate say this is breathtakingly radical. ” he meant it as a compliment. to bannon, the entire world order — from the two political parties to the wall street reliance on leveraging to multiculturalism — was undergoing an extraordinary realignment, one made manifest in the 2016 election. according to bannon’s vision, economic nationalism would reorient priorities to the working class’s benefit. trade deals, jobs programs, tax incentives, immigration restrictions, environmental deregulation and even foreign policy would ultimately serve to restore the primacy of those trump called “the forgotten americans. ” in march, when i spoke to trump by phone, i asked him what the term “economic nationalism” meant to him. compared with bannon’s revolutionary fervor, his reply was surprisingly cautious. “well, ‘nationalism’ — i define it as people who love the country and want it to do good,” he said. “i don’t see ‘nationalism’ as a bad word. i see it as a very positive word. it doesn’t mean we won’t trade with other countries. ” trump’s tone was genial but also a touch defensive. his postelection honeymoon had been short, if it existed at all. there were the administrative intrigues and twitter drama, along with the questions about his campaign’s contacts with russia, which had already forced the resignation of his national security adviser, michael flynn. still, trump’s legislative liaisons and their counterparts on capitol hill were doggedly negotiating a rollout of the trump era, one that would fulfill his most significant campaign promises — those that could not be done with just a stroke of trump’s own pen but required acts of congress. first, obamacare would be repealed and replaced. next, an austere budget would be passed, with emergency funds allotted for the construction of a wall along the southern border. then would come a plan, presumably of the type ryan and bannon discussed. and finally, a bipartisan coalition would deliver a infrastructure plan to trump’s desk. if all this came to pass by the end of 2017, it would lend some credence to trump’s pledge that this would be “the busiest congress we’ve had in decades. ” but by march, this timetable was looking like a formidable “if. ” trump himself seemed prone to distraction as he spoke to me from the oval office. though i was asking about his policy aims, his musings swerved off to other vexations. more than once he denounced as “fake news” reports about his administration’s supposed disharmony. he brought up his speech before the joint session of congress in february, “which i hope you liked, but i certainly have gotten great reviews — even the people who hate me gave me the highest review. ” during the call, i could hear priebus nearby, occasionally murmuring encouragement. trump sounded more clipped and less jaunty on the call than he did during the discursive chats i had with him last year on the campaign trail. the business of governing had little to do with any trade he had previously practiced. in congress, he was grappling with an arcane and famously inefficient ecosystem over which he had little if any control — and people he incessantly derided on the campaign trail as being “all talk and no action. ” i asked him if he still felt that way. “it’s like any other industry,” he replied, somewhat morosely. “i’ve met some great politicians and some, to be honest, who aren’t so hot. ” trump wanted to make sure that he was given adequate credit for his achievements, even in his administration’s infancy. “we’ve only been here for a tiny speck of time,” he said, “and what i’ve done with regulations, moving jobs back into the country, what i’ve done with airplane pricing and buying is amazing. we’ve done a lot. i think we’ve done more than anybody for this short period of time. ” abraham lincoln, franklin roosevelt and lyndon johnson would take exception to this claim. and trump’s significant actions to date have consisted entirely of executive orders. what he has not yet demonstrated is his ability to actually shepherd a bill into law. the only major legislation that congressional committees have even seen thus far is a bill to repeal and replace obamacare, which met with a stunning rebuke from trump’s own party, forcing ryan to withdraw the measure on the afternoon of march 24. at this stage of his presidency, barack obama had already signed into law his $787 billion package and had moved on to holding white house meetings on health care. it’s conceivable that trump could hit day 100 with only minor symbolic legislative achievements to his name. for him to avoid this ignominy, the 45th president will have to develop a rapport with washington’s 535 federal deal makers, including the ones who “aren’t so hot. ” whether trump’s agenda succeeds will also depend in no small measure on the ability of bannon to expand his game beyond 1600 pennsylvania ave. at 63, and with a fortune reported to be in the tens of millions of dollars — partly through his investment in the company that owns the syndication rights to “seinfeld” — bannon is regarded by trump as a peer in the way that, say, the lifelong politico priebus is not. he is also approvingly seen as a fellow workaholic by the president (whose only known hobbies are golf and cnn). and he is a deft operator who has learned from the successes and failures of other trump advisers. he has carefully not claimed credit that the president would wish for himself and avoids giving expansive interviews on his own controversial views that might detract from his boss’s celebrity. like the former campaign manager corey lewandowski, bannon understands that power in trump world derives mainly from close and sustained physical proximity to the boss. unlike lewandowski, bannon immediately grasped the importance of maintaining close relations with jared kushner, who factored heavily in lewandowski’s dismissal from the trump campaign last summer. but like kushner, bannon has never worked in government or at a institute and has no meaningful experience when it comes to getting legislation passed. on the hill, he has a few random associations — senator rand paul of kentucky and representative john culberson of texas among them. otherwise, he remains a looming but indistinct presence to the lawmakers who will be needed to pass most of trump’s agenda. bannon’s interest in this agenda predated his association with trump. one evening in january 2013, two guests showed up for dinner at the capitol hill townhouse that bannon liked to call the breitbart embassy. one was the man bannon would later describe to me as his “mentor”: senator jeff sessions of alabama. the other was sessions’s top aide and protégé, a jittery named stephen miller. two months earlier, obama decisively defeated mitt romney in the presidential election, prompting priebus, then the chairman of the republican national committee, to commission an analysis of the state of the party and its future, known colloquially in washington as the “autopsy,” which would be delivered that spring. the only certainty was that the report would urge republicans to court the growing latino electorate — which had voted for obama by a margin that november — by championing comprehensive immigration reform. the three men at the dinner table that night were among the few republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion. bannon wanted to talk to sessions and miller about a different report: an article written by sean trende, the senior elections analyst for the website realclearpolitics, titled “the case of the missing white voters. ” trende observed that obama’s victory was less a function of increased minority turnout than of the fact that 6. 6 million white voters who participated in the 2008 election stayed home in 2012. the reason for this drop, trende argued, was that white voters who did not approve of obama but were alienated by romney’s perceived elitism had not voted. these votes were gettable, bannon believed. as he would later tell me: “the working class, and in particular the lower middle class, understands something that’s so obvious — which is that they’ve basically underwritten the rise of china. their jobs, their raises, their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built china. because china’s really built on investments and exports, right? people are smart enough to know that they’re getting played by both political parties. the two may be different on social issues, but when it comes to fundamental economics, they’re both the same. that’s why the american working class is interested in trade. it’s linked to their lives. ” sessions shared bannon’s belief that the republican party needed to emphasize immigration reduction, border security and the preservation of jobs through trade policy rather than courting latino voters with a bill he regarded as “amnesty. ” as sessions would write in a memorandum to his republican colleagues six months later, “this humble and honest populism — in contrast to the administration’s cheap demagoguery — would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party. ” at some point during the dinner, bannon recalls blurting out to sessions, “we have to run you for president. ” just two years earlier, in 2011, he made a similar pitch to sarah palin, after completing a documentary about her called “the undefeated. ” palin demurred. she was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth, she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by bannon’s warning that she stood little chance of defeating obama. now he delivered a similar message to sessions. “look, you’re not going to win,” he recalls saying. “but you can get the republican nomination. and once you control the apparatus, you can make fundamental changes. trade is no. 100 on the party’s list. you can make it no. 1. immigration is no. 10. we can make it no. 2. ” acknowledging that the drawling alabama senator lacked palin’s charisma, bannon said, “you’ll be the . ” but sessions told bannon he did not see himself running for president. “it was pretty obvious by the end of the night,” bannon recalled, “that another candidate would have to do it. ” two months later, on march 15, 2013, bannon happened to be attending the conservative political action conference in washington when trump took the stage. trump had been a marginal figure at most in politics up to that point, entertaining a reform party run in the 2000 election — when he speculated that he would probably take more votes from the democratic candidate than the republican one — and leading a conspiratorial crusade in 2011 to force obama to release his birth certificate. the possibility that he might be a suitable host body for bannon’s worldview had not occurred to bannon before trump spoke. but trump’s grousing references to china’s economic superiority, to 11 million “illegals” and to the erosion of america’s manufacturing sector were right out of bannon’s playbook. from his desk in the russell senate office building, stephen miller, too, watched trump’s speech. by 2014, miller was sending emails to friends expressing the hope that trump would run for president. by the time trump announced his candidacy, in june 2015, sessions was officially uncommitted but privately of the view that trump was best suited to tap into the movement that he, miller and bannon discussed over dinner more than two years earlier. bannon’s early support for trump was manifest in breitbart’s breathless coverage of his candidacy. in an email he sent on aug. 30, 2015, to his former filmmaking partner julia jones, bannon explained that while republican candidates like ted cruz, bobby jindal, ben carson and carly fiorina were “all great,” trump represented a superior choice, because he “is a nationalist who embraces senator sessions’s plan” on immigration. still, recalls sam nunberg, trump’s first campaign strategist, “steve kept all of his cards. ” he added: “he was respectful to some of the other ones who were running, like walker and cruz and carson. he didn’t want to be seen as . ” when trump publicly disparaged john mccain’s credentials, bannon — himself a navy veteran — called nunberg and demanded that trump issue an apology. (trump did not.) bannon was well positioned as a supportive but not sycophantic observer by aug. 13, 2016, when the trump donor rebekah mercer read with alarm a new york times account of the trump campaign’s inability to handle its mercurial candidate. at mercer’s behest, bannon (whose website mercer’s family helped underwrite) and kellyanne conway (who at that point was receiving money from both a mercer family political action committee and the trump campaign) flew out that day to east hampton, n. y. where trump was attending a dinner at the home of the new york jets’ owner, woody johnson. after the dinner, bannon and conway huddled with the candidate. bannon remembers telling trump, who at the time was trailing hillary clinton by double digits in the polls, “as long as you stick to the message” — by which he meant economic nationalism — “you have a 100 percent probability of winning. ” a week after the election, in an interview with the journalist michael wolff, bannon offered a bold, sweeping sketch of what the vision might mean in policy terms: “like [andrew] jackson’s populism, we’re going to build an entirely new political movement. it’s everything related to jobs. the conservatives are going to go crazy. ” of course, some of the conservatives bannon intended to drive crazy possessed the congressional votes bannon and trump would need to advance this agenda. representative jim jordan of ohio, a leading conservative in the house, told me in march, “i would argue that populism, as long as it’s rooted in conservative principle, is a darn good thing. ” jordan was smiling as he said it, but the note of warning was hard to mistake. the last time the republican party controlled all branches of government in washington was from 2003 to 2007. during that period, the united states military toppled saddam hussein, congress delivered tax cuts for the wealthy and president george w. bush appointed the reliably conservative jurist samuel a. alito jr. to the supreme court. but in the collective view of conservatives, these years of the bush presidency were mostly characterized by betrayal and disappointment. goaded by bush, congressional republicans passed into law a new federal entitlement (prescription drugs for senior citizens, also known as medicare part d) ran up the deficit, promoted democratic ideals overseas in the feckless manner of woodrow wilson, considered a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and confirmed a supreme court chief justice, john g. roberts jr. whose swing vote would later save obamacare from judicial evisceration. “my line when i first ran in 2008 was, ‘republicans had the house, the senate and the white house — and they blew it,’’u2009” representative jason chaffetz of utah, the chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee, told me. “now we’ve got all three again, and i’m the guy who’s in congress, not running for it. i don’t want to be in a position where we’re going to blow it one more time. ” chaffetz and other house conservatives freely acknowledge that trump is not cut from their cloth, but they say they could not care less as long as he gives them what they want. selecting judge neil gorsuch to fill the supreme court seat once held by justice antonin scalia was “the best thing the president did in his first 50 days,” chaffetz told me. he and his conservative colleagues have been cheered by trump’s recruitment of former house colleagues and conservative stalwarts like vice president mike pence tom price, the health and human services secretary and mick mulvaney, the office of management and budget director. when chaffetz and i spoke in march, he had met with the president twice so far — access he considered “such a huge sea change” from the stony silence republicans say they encountered from the obama white house. most important, the trump agenda’s first three projected legislative moves — the obamacare repeal and replacement, an austere budget and tax reform — were intended to keep conservatives happily in trump’s camp. in turn, when the agenda moved on to less conservative items like infrastructure and trade agreements, trump and bannon would fully expect republicans, including ryan, to remember whose message resonated most with voters last year. representative kevin mccarthy, the house majority leader, is trump’s chief point of contact on the hill. when mccarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in bakersfield, calif. in the late 1980s, his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, judy, gave him an autographed copy of trump’s “the art of the deal. ” “i thought it was great,” he told me. in mccarthy’s view, trump is a master of today’s media, much as lincoln and kennedy were in their own times. “he’s mastered instantaneous twitter,” he said. “it’s like owning newspapers. ” trump has found a kindred spirit in mccarthy, a coastal extrovert of ambiguous ideological portfolio who (unlike ryan) would far rather talk about personalities than the tax code. and as the former minority leader in the california legislature during the governorship of arnold schwarzenegger, mccarthy is experienced in the care and feeding of celebrity egos. since trump’s nomination, the two have spoken frequently by phone — to date, trump has never been known to directly email or text anyone — about the cast of 535 characters with whom the president must now deal. but in the end, what trump needs from the majority leader is not gossip but votes — 216 of them, to be exact, in the house. and mccarthy’s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest. in his previous capacity as house whip, he was thwarted by members of his own party when it came to subjects as diverse as reauthorizing a patriot act they deemed too intrusive, a farm bill they considered too expensive and a bill they regarded as too lenient. his most reliable obstacles have been the three dozen or so house conservatives known as the freedom caucus, a group of fiscal . early this year, mccarthy predicted to me that the new president would quickly subjugate the freedom caucus. “trump is strong in their districts,” mccarthy told me. “there’s not a place for them to survive in this world. ” when we spoke on the morning of march 7, trump assured me that he would not bully the bill’s loudest republican critics, like the freedom caucus chairman, representative mark meadows, on twitter: “no, i don’t think i’ll have to,” he said. “mark meadows is a great guy and a friend of mine. i don’t think he’d ever disappoint me, or the party. i think he’s great. no, i would never call him out on twitter. some of the others, too. i don’t think we’ll need to. now, they’re fighting for their turf, but i don’t think they’re going to be obstructionists. i spoke to mark. he’s got some ideas. i think they’re very positive. ” but on march 21, in a meeting with the freedom caucus about the bill, trump called out meadows by name, saying, “i’m going to come after you, but i know i won’t have to, because i know you’ll vote ‘yes. ’’u2009” meadows remained a “no” on the bill, and among conservatives, he was far from alone. one of the freedom caucus’s most outspoken members, representative raúl labrador of idaho, believes that the trump white house was led astray by ryan’s confidence that he knew what conservatives wanted when drafting the bill. “the legislation has to go through the body, not the top,” labrador told me. “and if our leadership thinks now that we’re a unified body, that they can do things while ignoring us, that’s not going to happen. ” labrador is an affable but decidedly stubborn mormon and former immigration lawyer who moved as a child with his single mother from puerto rico to las vegas. he was interviewed by the for the post of interior secretary at trump tower last december — though trump selected labrador’s house colleague ryan zinke for the post a few days later. for now, labrador and other freedom caucus members have been willing to blame house leaders like ryan and mccarthy for drafting a health care bill that was not to conservatives’ liking. they aspire to remain philosophical whenever trump’s daughter ivanka persuades her father to propose initiatives like paid family leave, as he did during his speech. “i didn’t stand up when he said that,” labrador said. “that’s the only part of the speech where i thought, that’s not even close to what my party stands for. ” to house conservatives like labrador, the republican party stands for limited government. to trump and bannon, items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking america’s debt. as chaffetz admitted to me, “on the spending front, things could slip away really quickly. ” trump’s budget blueprint is regarded by deficit hawks as fundamentally unserious, because it does not touch entitlements. instead, it ravages perennial (and already ) conservative piñatas like foreign aid, public broadcasting and the national endowment for the arts, in addition to downsizing the environmental protection agency and the interior department — cuts that focus on the 27 percent of the federal budget that is not mandatory spending or devoted to defense. and for all the republicans’ chesty rhetoric on cuts like these over the years, as a top house republican staff member told me, “even the cabinet secretaries at the e. p. a. and interior are saying these cuts aren’t going to happen. they’re going to protect their grant programs, their payments to states, their superfunds. so how do you cut 31 percent of the e. p. a. out of the 5 percent that isn’t protected? and a bill that cuts all money for the n. e. a. will not pass. for republicans in the west” — states whose vast rural areas benefit disproportionately from n. e. a. grants — “that’s a killer. the campaign commercials write themselves. ” labrador says he would defend trump’s cuts but doubts that many of his colleagues would. “what he’s going to learn is that members of congress are unwilling to take the tough votes,” he told me. “when he learns that, what’s going to be the next step?” in labrador’s view, trump’s only sane recourse will be to accept the need for entitlement reform. “at some point, the reality of the budget is going to have to hit him,” he said. “you can have this economic nationalism — bannon is very smart, he clearly helped him with his messaging, it was so successful — but at some point, that theory is going to hit reality. ” when i spoke with trump, i ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn’t hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. trump’s reply was immediate. “i think you’re right,” he said. in fact, trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. “we’re also going to prime the pump,” he said. “you know what i mean by ‘prime the pump’? in order to get this” — the economy — “going, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that’ll be going, we’re going to have to prime the pump to some extent. in other words: spend money to make a lot more money in the future. and that’ll happen. ” a clearer elucidation of keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by obama. the one clear point of agreement between the trump economic nationalists and the house conservatives is the one ryan and bannon identified over dinner in january: tax reform. but in so doing, they will be picking a fight that may prove perilous to republicans. the proposal that ryan floated to bannon has never been able to get past k street lobbyists and wealthy republican donors like the koch brothers. when i asked trump if he was a fan of the tax, he replied: “i am. i’m the king of that. ” almost no other country grafts an import tax onto a corporate tax, and it’s possible that enacting a tax might well be in violation of the world trade organization’s agreements. of course, bannon has openly advocated abandoning the w. t. o. anyway, because of china’s membership in it. still, the specter of new taxes on american corporations, higher prices for consumers and a jump in the dollar’s value may compel an unusual confederacy against the plan. labrador predicts that the tax “will have very little political legs” in the conservative house, while senator lindsey graham said in february that even in the senate, ryan’s tax plan “won’t get 10 votes. ” senator heidi heitkamp, a north dakota democrat who has been outspoken in her willingness to work with trump in spite of the broader stance of her party, says, “let me tell you, i represent farmers, and anyone who tells me that farm country benefits from a high dollar needs to have a discussion with me. ” perhaps the republican faction most alarmed by bannon’s economic nationalism is washington’s military hawks. john mccain is among those not mollified by trump’s pledge of enacting “one of the largest increases in spending in american history. ” mccain scoffed when i brought this up to him. “of course that’s simply not true,” he said. “when you look at 1981 and reagan’s commitment to rebuilding the military, there’s no comparison to this 3 percent increase. it’s a shell game, my friend. ” despite his obvious differences with trump, mccain was willing to work with him — but bannon’s presence seemed to confound such prospects. “it’s kind of interesting,” mccain said, “because i have decades of experience with kelly, with mattis, with dan coats, mcmaster,” referring to homeland security secretary john kelly defense secretary james mattis dan coats, the director of national intelligence and h. r. mcmaster, the national security adviser. “we discuss issues all the time. i think this is probably the finest team that i’ve ever observed. it’s almost schizophrenic, in that i obviously don’t have conversations with steve bannon, but i do with reince priebus — he was my republican chair in wisconsin in my 2008 presidential campaign. so it’s almost a schizophrenic — that’s not the right word. a very divided kind of relationship. paradoxical. ” mccain acknowledged to me that economic nationalism was a global movement and therefore not entirely “the making of some members of the trump entourage. ” he then said: “but it is an articulation that i believe is strongly reminiscent of the 1930s. it certainly has unsettled our allies and friends around the world, there’s no doubt about that. ” already, the senator asserted, the new administration’s bellicosity toward mexico has increased the likelihood that its citizens will elect “a very president. ” as for an import tax of the sort favored by bannon and ryan, “talk about harkening back to the 1930s,” he said. “it’s unbelievable to me that they somehow think if we start taxing goods coming across the border, that that’s somehow not going to be responded to by the mexicans. please. history shows this sort of action gets you into a trade war. ” listening to mccain’s tirade, i found it evident that the bannon effect might well cost the trump white house at least one republican senate vote on a number of central issues — this at a time when republicans are clinging to a slender majority in the upper chamber. in such cases, trump could find himself asking for something obama was never able to count on: votes from the opposition. early in the afternoon of feb. 9, several democratic senators met with trump in the roosevelt room of the white house to discuss the gorsuch nomination and other matters. among them were heidi heitkamp, joe donnelly of indiana, joe manchin of west virginia and jon tester of montana. all four are moderates who are up for in 2018 in states trump carried in 2016 by titanic margins — the least of which, in donnelly’s state, was nearly 20 points. if democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the senate majority, they will need to hold these four seats. but if donnelly, heitkamp, manchin and tester need to be seen back home as willing to work with trump, the president needs them as well. republicans enjoy a precarious advantage in the senate. on matters like the supreme court, trump can count on all 52. on votes requiring a simple majority, any two of those republicans could fall away, and pence could preserve the win with a tiebreaking vote. but a trio of fiscal (like ted cruz, rand paul and mike lee) military hawks (john mccain, lindsey graham and marco rubio) or social moderates (susan collins, lisa murkowski and shelley moore capito) could deny trump a majority, unless he could swing at least one democrat to his side. that february afternoon in the roosevelt room, donnelly thanked trump for negotiating with carrier, the manufacturing company based in indiana that had threatened to move jobs to mexico before trump it into keeping many of them in indiana. but donnelly urged him not to view that episode as a “ . ” he requested the president’s support for his end outsourcing act, which would give preferential treatment in awarding federal contracts to businesses that kept jobs in america. the words were scarcely out of donnelly’s mouth before trump said, “i’m 100 percent for that, and i’ll do everything i can to help get it passed. ” he then asked pence, who was in the room, “what do you think, mike?” trump was apparently unaware that pence, as the governor of donnelly’s state, had refused to back the senator’s initiative, claiming instead that burdensome federal regulations were to blame for outsourcing. according to donnelly, pence gamely replied, “if it’s like what joe describes, i’ll do everything i can to help. ” donnelly, a irish catholic with a barroom guffaw, had met trump once before. in january 2011, he was among the blue dog coalition, composed of conservative house democrats — what remained of them, anyway, after the previous november’s disastrous midterms — who traveled to new york for their annual retreat. at a hotel conference room in midtown manhattan, the 20 or so blue dogs received a procession of guests, including mayor michael bloomberg and former president bill clinton. only one of their scheduled appointments required that they go to their guest — and so they did, by bus, to trump tower. trump greeted them in his boardroom, with its commanding view of central park. he was charming but also brash. “remember, at that point he wasn’t really talking about running for office,” recalls one attendee, former representative dan boren of oklahoma. “but what strikes me was how he talked about the same issues — the wall, china — that became his stump speech years later. ” it was evident to the blue dogs that trump was no clinton or bloomberg when it came to the issues. says former representative ben chandler of kentucky, who was also in attendance: “the difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark. trump just made bald assertions, really. ” particularly memorable to chandler was trump’s insistence “that one of the best things the country could do was slap a massive tariff on the chinese. ” chandler continued: “he seemed not to understand that this would probably cause the entire world economy to melt down by causing a huge trade war. what i remember more than anything else was our general reaction afterward. and it was one of disbelief. ” today donnelly remains offended by what he calls trump’s “crazy stuff,” as well as the alternative to obamacare that trump supported. but he does not begrudge trump his showmanship. “he came to the carrier plant,” donnelly said. “i’ve been working on that issue since day 1. i was begging people in the obama administration to come out and talk to our workers. donald trump came out there. and donald trump talked to our workers. you can tell people you care. but it matters if you show up. ” the senate democrat who, to outward appearances, seems closest to trump is joe manchin, who met face to face with the in trump tower in december. before the meeting, bannon took the west virginia senator aside. “the thing you need to know about trump,” bannon said, “is he doesn’t care about the republican party and he doesn’t care about the democratic party. he just wants to put some wins on the board for the country. ” in the meeting, trump asked manchin what could be done for coal miners. manchin replied that he should support his miners protection act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. according to manchin, trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure. later that month, manchin went on “morning joe” — the one show on msnbc that trump has been known to watch — to discuss, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the newtown school massacre, the need to expand background checks on gun purchases. within an hour after manchin was offscreen, his cellphone rang. it was trump. manchin was not completely forthcoming about the conversation, but he did tell me that he envisioned “a complete opportunity” for new legislation. unlike with obama, he said, “no one thinks president trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights. ” in his conversations with manchin and donnelly, trump was essentially throwing his support behind a democratic initiative without first checking with the republican senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell, to ask what he thought of those proposals. had he done so, the answer in each case would have been: not much. (though on the coal miners’ legislation, manchin said: “we’re seeing mitch mcconnell go from a ‘no, no and hell no’ to now dropping his own bill. which is fine, so long as we get it. ”) still, trump may have little choice but to indulge democrats on some of their pet issues, given that he will need their votes on two of the most critical pieces of his agenda: infrastructure and trade deals. until now, trump has divulged few details about this infrastructure venture. on the campaign trail, he frequently cited america’s crumbling roads and bridges. he bemoaned the potholes defiling the runways at la guardia airport, where he parked his two planes. during donnelly’s visit with trump in the roosevelt room, the president “talked about the tunnel with the tiles falling off, which he would see on his way to la guardia,” donnelly recalled. (the metropolitan transportation authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel.) when i asked trump for more specifics, he gingerly offered a few morsels: “this is something that’s going to be a real infrastructure bill, where real work is going to be done on bridges and roads and airports and things that we’re supposed to be doing. so it’s not just a political piece of paper. we’re going to do infrastructure, and it’s going to be a very big thing. ” trump’s description struck me as uncharacteristically modest. bannon had evoked a more gleaming vision when he told me: “look, economic nationalism is predicated on a infrastructure for the country, right? broadband as good as korea. airports as good as china. roads as good as germany. a rail system as good as france. if you’re going to be a power, you’ve got to have a infrastructure. ” when i asked the president if his initiative might include such features, he replied: “yes. it could, it could. you look at japan and china, where they have the fast trains, and we don’t have any. you look at other countries where we used to be the leader, and now we’re the laggard. it’s not going to happen anymore. ” what also may not happen is house republicans’ supporting a bill that is at least somewhat reminiscent of the stimulus bill they unanimously opposed eight years ago. it’s also possible that even moderate democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to trump’s rescue. after all, the president remains intensely unpopular among democrats, who continue to nurture hopes that trump is one russia connection away from impeachment. as a senior white house official told me of gorsuch’s nomination to the supreme court: “the comment we often get from democrats is, ‘that’s a great nominee.’ oh, so you’re voting for him? ‘i can’t.’ why not? ‘my base would go crazy, and i’d be primaried.’ that environment has to change before we can have any of these conversations. ” on the morning of feb. 2, two democratic leaders on trade issues, senator ron wyden of oregon and representative richard neal of massachusetts — the ranking members of the senate finance and house ways and means committees — met with trump, along with a few of his advisers and republican lawmakers. trump had already greeted the day by threatening to yank federal funding from the university of california at berkeley after acts of violence had forced the cancellation of the breitbart editor milo yiannopoulos’s speech on campus, and by taunting arnold schwarzenegger’s poor ratings on “the apprentice” during the national prayer breakfast. disquiet lingered from trump’s travel ban on refugees and his surly phone conversation with the australian prime minister the previous week. amid this chaos — entirely to bannon’s liking and grating to nearly everyone else in washington — actual legislative activity was slowly unfolding. trump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors. the press pool was then ushered out before the democrats could say anything in front of the cameras. when neal was given a chance to speak, he informed trump, pence, bannon, kushner and commerce secretary wilbur ross that america had in fact prospered as a result of past trade deals. neal emphasized the crucial role that the panama canal played in the economic vitality of the eastern seaboard. other than ross, no one on trump’s team seemed aware of this. “they were a bit surprised,” neal later told me. he was also struck by the white house’s abhorrence of multilateral pacts, which seemed to him to be naïve. “the idea that you’re going to negotiate 148 bilateral agreements with w. t. o. members does not seem realistic,” neal said. “the idea that we’re all of a sudden going to have a agreement with great britain, that’s going to take years to do. ” later, neal said, ross privately assured him that the trump administration “would not give up on multilateral deals. ” neal’s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of trump and bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric. of all the legislative lifts, none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements, which require a simple majority approval by both the senate and the house. scrounging up 15 democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue. but just as democrats like neal in the northeast would fight for a trade deal that benefits their region, so will republican lawmakers along the southern border rebel at an effort to repeal nafta. as mccain told me, “if you negated nafta, it would send my state into a severe recession. ” he assured me that trump’s nationalist posture would not provoke only regional opposition. he conjured up another republican era — not reagan’s, not bush’s, but instead that of herbert hoover, when two republican lawmakers joined with a republican president to design a protectionist initiative that ultimately caused american exports to plummet during the great depression. “somewhere,” mccain said with a dark chuckle, “mr. smoot and mr. hawley are smiling. ” on thursday, march 23, trump hosted a morning meeting of freedom caucus holdouts in the cabinet room. jeff duncan, a congressman from south carolina who was present, told me that trump told them: “i need you guys. we need to put up a win. it’s not just about needing to repeal obamacare — though we do. it’s also that a win here sets up a win for tax reform and gives us momentum going into infrastructure. and if the bill fails, it could derail all of that. ” with customary bravado, trump told the conservative members that he didn’t want to squeak by with just a victory. “i want all 237 of you,” he said, according to duncan, referring to the entire house republican conference. that included the more moderate members, who had told trump they felt that the white house wasn’t paying sufficient attention to their concerns. later in the day, trump hosted another meeting with the moderates, where representative charlie dent of pennsylvania informed trump that he remained a “no. ” according to an attendee, trump angrily informed dent that he was “destroying the republican party” and “was going to take down tax reform — and i’m going to blame you. ” until that day, duncan had been an unyielding “no” on the bill. the previous week, he delivered an impassioned speech to the vice president and other republicans, insisting that this vote constituted “our generation’s rendezvous with destiny — a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal obamacare. ” in a text to me, duncan pointed to history: “39 men in a hot room in 1787 had the courage to break from the norm and empower a nation. ” but now the congressman was, for the first time in his life, sitting across the table from a president who was personally appealing for his support. the white house was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing. duncan left the meeting and spent a few hours pondering, as he would later put it, “the greater opportunity we as republicans have. ” by that evening, trump had won jeff duncan’s vote. it wasn’t enough. the next afternoon, ryan pulled the house health care bill, conceding that neither he nor the white house could muster enough votes. “you get about nine months to do the big things,” kevin mccarthy, the house majority leader, told me at the beginning of the year. nine months seemed like a long time then, the calendar spacious and the legislative possibilities plentiful. but more than two of those months are gone already — and the path to future wins, as trump foresaw in his meeting with the freedom caucus, is now more complicated. when he took office, trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the white house. by the time i spoke with him in early march, however, he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers. he still saw himself as the closer in chief — but then that was “typical, i would think, of a president,” he mused. “some more than others. ”",0,10,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,0.5872222222222234,1.8,0.0,0.0
sean hannity loses his sh*t after getting his ass handed to him by new york times writers,"it s time for sean hannity to join bill o reilly in the unemployment line.on saturday, the new york times published an article reporting that donald trump gets policy advise from sean hannity among many others outside the white house. sean hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core republican issues is crucial presidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but mr. trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like mr. hannity who also serve as advisers. mr. hannity, the fox news host, defends mr. trump s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to mr. trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the affordable care act. indeed, hannity served as trump s chief propagandist during the 2016 campaign and often did interviews with hannity in order to get the kid gloves treatment.of course, hannity had a complete meltdown on twitter over the article and proceeded to accuse the new york times of colluding with hillary clinton and referred to them as fake news, which is something trump would do.@nytimes you colluded with hrc in 2016. it s none of your business who i do or do not talk too. total fake news speculation about me/@potus sean hannity (@seanhannity) april 22, 2017hannity even accused the times of spying on his private conversations.@nytimes any conversation i have with anyone is supposed to be private. i have never talked to you. was i surveilled and unmasked by u/nsa?

poll: 60 percent of adults ’hopeful and optimistic’ about america’s future - breitbart,"sixty percent of adults feel “hopeful and optimistic” about the future of the country, a wall street news poll released sunday shows, while president trump’s net approval rating is negative — for now. [when asked, “when you think about the future of the country, would you say that you are mainly hopeful and optimistic or mainly worried and pessimistic,” sixty percent of 1, 000 adults surveyed from feb. 18 t0 feb. 22 said they were hopeful, not pessimistic. that’s a steady upward drift from 53 percent in august, and 56 percent in december. pollsters note the margin of error is plus or minus 3. 1 percentage points. meanwhile, trump himself fares slightly less well: 44 percent approve of the job he’s doing as president, while 48 percent disapprove. the surge in optimism is driven in part by trump voters’ enthusiasm, according to what pollster bill mcinturff told the washington examiner: “this is a strong number being driven by very high numbers among trump voters who express optimism across a number of measures on the poll, including higher economic confidence. ” but other groups are feeling hopeful, too. over half, or 52 percent, of hispanics are hopeful about the future of america, not worried. so are 65 percent of whites. (among blacks, only 36 percent feel optimistic.) nearly all republicans, or 87 percent, are hopeful about the future, as well as 56 percent of independents. and so are 37 percent of democrats. so, trump has broad appeal with whites and hispanics, along with a significant minority of democrats — and a majority of independent voters. that’s solid enough of a coalition to sustain power and encourage a younger generation of republican leaders, such as arkansas sen. tom cotton, to champion a populist, nationalist agenda. trump’s approval ratings may be low at the moment, but his administration is still brand new and voters outside centers of concentrated, democratic power are still cautiously warming to him. the losers of the globalization game were stigmatized as bigoted or hateful for protesting policies enabling cheap labor, low wages, mass immigration, communities, family disintegration, drug addiction, suicide. the years leading up to the election were marked by an incredible expansion of the labor pool and a $ wealth transfer to wall street. every job created from 2000 to 2014 went to the large, population residing in the u. s. which stands at roughly 42. 4 million people. coincidentally, morality rates “from drug poisoning, alcohol poisoning, and suicide increased by 52 percent between 2000 and 2014,” according to one university study. “nearly half of all young white male deaths are caused by drugs, alcohol, or suicide,” wrote the author, compared to roughly a quarter of young hispanic male deaths and 13 percent of young black deaths. the economist found that 41 percent of white, working class men have given up looking for work. over 47, 000 people died from deaths in 2014 alone, and heroin overdose deaths have more than tripled between 2010 and 2015. the wave of death washing over american communities elicited little notice, let alone outrage, from the political establishment and mega media outlets. immigration also fueled this surge of : nearly all of the heroin used in the u. s. is brought across the border by mexican traffickers. but the globalist class plowed ahead with its agenda anyway, deepening the sense of alienation many felt, particularly those drawn to trump. “the sacredness of mass immigration is the mystic chord that unites america’s ruling and intellectual classes,” as one pseudonymous essayist wrote in the in the claremont review of books. many sensed they were being denied a say in the way their lives were being shaped, and in many cases, destroyed by the globalists’ preferred policies: before trump assumed office, 84 percent of white, voters told pollsters that u. s. government did not represent their views. “the archipelago of constituencies loyal to democrats is small geographically. but it has lately set close to 100 percent of the agenda, and did so even in the 2016 election,” writes the weekly standard‘s christopher caldwell. “the important cultural innovations of the obama administration can fairly be said to have been introduced without debate, or at least in disregard of what debate had been going on,” caldwell writes. “gay marriage was this way, as was the complex of issues surrounding transgender bathrooms. where did the movement black lives matter come from, with its mix of street violence and campus political correctness? … why was no one in authority talking about the heroin and opioid epidemic, even as it was killing more americans than any drug wave in american history, more even than car accidents?” “perhaps the main thing voters were trying to do in 2016 was to restore democratic scrutiny to actors who had long managed to evade it. we will never know, because for many years americans have felt unable to talk about such things in public at all,” he said. and now, trump has an opportunity to build a lasting governing coalition out of voters ignored or mocked by the globalist class. “the globalists gutted the american working class and created a middle class in asia,” white house chief strategist steve bannon said during a november interview. “the issue now is about americans looking to not get f — ed over. ” “if we deliver, we’ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and hispanic vote and we’ll govern for 50 years,” he said. “that’s what the democrats missed … they lost sight of what the world is about. ”",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.673333333333336,14.8,0.0,0.0

pakistan blocks off roads into capital as blasphemy law supporters stage sit-in,"rawalpindi, pakistan (reuters) - pakistan on friday blocked off roads into islamabad, the capital, as an islamist party that backs strict blasphemy laws staged a sit-in on a key highway, demanding the resignation of a minister it blames for changes to an electoral oath. dozens of pakistanis are on death row, convicted of having insulted islam s prophet, a charge that carries a mandatory death sentence, although no executions have been carried out. more than 500 supporters of the tehrik-e-labaik pakistan party, or movement of the prophet s followers, chanted slogans as speakers addressed them from atop a cargo truck, pledging their lives to protect pakistan s blasphemy laws. the protesters demanded the resignation of law minister zahid hamid, whom they hold responsible for the law change, and denounced him as a blasphemer. immediately appear before us and beg for forgiveness, said one speaker. two high court lawyers who joined the sit-in said they would work to advance labaik s agenda in the courts. he (hamid) has insulted the blasphemy laws, the punishment for which is death, said one of the lawyers. pakistan s interior ministry did not immediately answer telephone calls from reuters to seek comment. the ruling pakistani muslim league-nawaz (pml-n) unexpectedly set off a firestorm last month after voting through the alteration of the oath, among seemingly small changes to the nation s electoral law. the changes prompted accusations of blasphemy from religious parties and the government retreated, apologizing in parliament for what it called a clerical mistake. but the apology did not satisfy tehreek-e-labaik, triggering the sit-in, as the culmination of a march of nearly 400 km (249 miles) from the eastern city of lahore. the party rose to prominence in september, after placing third in a by-election in lahore, edging out a major opposition party to pick up 6 percent of the vote. last month, it gained nearly 8 percent in a by-election in the northwestern city of peshawar. while tehrik-e-labaik is unlikely to break out of single digits in coming votes, its rapid rise could present a challenge for the pml-n. on a bridge overlooking the highway demonstration site, drivers of trucks halted by blockades erected by city authorities complained about cargo delivery delays. one commuter unable to take public transport to work told reuters his business had suffered. i run a tailoring shop and can t go to work today, said mohammad altaf. i have lost a day s earnings.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.740000000000002,14.8,0.0,0.0

trump campaign star conway named as his presidential counselor,"washington (reuters) - kellyanne conway, a republican pollster who was widely credited with bringing a more disciplined approach to donald trump’s presidential election campaign, will become white house counselor when he takes office next month. in her new post, conway will play a key advisory role, helping to manage trump’s messaging and legislative priorities, the transition team said in a statement on thursday. it praised conway, 49, as the first woman campaign manager to guide a winning u.s. presidential campaign. trump also tapped three loyalists to lead his communications team. the republican national committee’s sean spicer will be press secretary, while hope hicks, jason miller and dan scavino will round out the communications team. both before the nov. 8 election and after, conway, as a senior adviser on the transition team, has been a frequent presence on u.s. television news programs, often called upon to defend or explain trump’s thinking. conway “played a crucial role in my victory,” trump said in the transition team statement. “she is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message.” trump, a new york businessman, takes office on jan. 20. conway, interviewed by abc’s “good morning america” shortly after the announcement, was asked when trump would hold his first news conference. she avoided directly answering the question. trump has held several rallies since winning the election but has not taken formal questions from reporters. he canceled a dec. 15 news conference to discuss how he would handle his vast business interests once in the white house and said he would reschedule that for january. conway told abc that trump was focusing on forming his cabinet. “he’s been very busy doing that,” she said. because of her prominent role in the campaign and transition team, there had been considerable speculation over what post conway, a veteran political strategist, might occupy in trump’s administration. conway, who has four children, said she did not immediately accept a position offered to her early on in the transition period because she had to weigh her family obligations. “i would say that i don’t play golf and i don’t have a mistress so, i have a lot of time that a lot of these other men don’t,” conway told fox business network. “i see people on the weekend spending an awful lot of time on their golf games and that’s their right, but the kids will be with me, we live in the same house, and they come first.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,8.89777777777778,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0

trump open to signing russia sanctions legislation: official,"washington (reuters) - the white house said on sunday that u.s. president donald trump was open to signing legislation toughening sanctions on russia after senate and house leaders reached agreement on a bill late last week. congressional democrats said on saturday they had agreed with republicans on a deal allowing new sanctions targeting russia, iran and north korea in a bill that would limit any potential effort by trump to try to lift sanctions against moscow. “we support where the legislation is now and will continue working with the house and senate to put those tough sanctions in place on russia until the situation in ukraine is fully resolved and it certainly isn’t right now,” white house press secretary sarah sanders told abc’s “this week with george stephanopoulos” program. a white house official said the administration’s view of the legislation evolved after changes were made, including the addition of sanctions on north korea. the official said the administration “supports the direction the bill is headed, but won’t weigh in conclusively until there is a final piece of legislation and no more changes are being made.” anthony scaramucci, trump’s new communications director, said trump had not yet decided whether he would sign the bill. “my guess is ... that he’s going to make that decision shortly,” scaramucci told cnn’s “state of the union.” trump has faced resistance from republican and democratic lawmakers for his pledge to pursue warmer relations with moscow. his administration has been bogged down by investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and russia. trump has said his campaign did not collude with russia. with the bill, republicans and democrats are seeking to punish russia for its 2014 annexation of crimea from ukraine and for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. russian president vladimir putin has denied any interference in the u.s. democratic process last year. the house is expected to vote on the sanctions bill on tuesday. the legislation would require the president to submit to congress a report on proposed actions that would “significantly alter” u.s. policy toward russia, including easing sanctions or returning diplomatic properties in maryland and new york that former president barack obama ordered vacated in december. congress would have at least 30 days to hold hearings and then vote to uphold or reject trump’s proposed changes. if trump were to veto the bill, he would run the risk of an embarrassing political setback if congress were to override his veto. in recent weeks, trump administration officials have met with lawmakers to argue against parts of the senate version of the bill, including the requirement that trump obtain congress’ permission before easing sanctions. the sanctions bill, known as the countering iran’s destabilizing activities act, was passed by the senate a month ago but held up in the house of representatives after republicans proposed including sanctions on north korea. lawmakers, including republican senator john thune and senator ben cardin, the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, said on sunday the bill had broad bipartisan support. “i think (it) will pass probably overwhelmingly again in the senate and with a veto-proof majority,” thune, a member of the republican leadership, told “fox news sunday.” in brussels, the european union has sounded an alarm about the u.s. moves to step up sanctions on russia, urging washington to coordinate with its group of 7 partners. the european commission, the eu executive, will consider its next steps at a meeting on wednesday in brussels if trump signs the bill into law, and is willing to consider retaliation, according to an eu official. after warning against unilateral u.s. sanctions at the g20 summit in hamburg, germany, commission president jean-claude juncker is concerned congress’ legislation could hit european companies upgrading pipelines in russia that feed into ukraine’s gas transit system. the measures could also target european companies doing legitimate business with russia in rail transport, financial, shipping and mining, the eu official said. any significant eu retaliation would need the support, however, of the eu’s 28 governments and would face resistance from members of the bloc, such as britain and hungary, that are reluctant to upset the trump administration.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.605000000000004,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
china tightens control of chat groups ahead of party congress,"beijing (reuters) - china issued new rules on instant messaging chat groups on thursday, tightening control over online discussions ahead of a sensitive leadership reshuffle next month. beijing has been ramping up measures to secure the internet and maintain strict censorship, a process that has accelerated ahead of the 19th national congress of the communist party, when global attention will be on the world s no.2 economy. group chats on instant messaging apps and online commenting threads have seen a surge in popularity in china in recent years as forums for discussion, partly because they are private for members and so in theory are subject to less censorship. internet chat service providers must now verify the identities of their users and keep a blog of group chats for no less than six months, the cyberspace administration of china said in a statement released on its website the rules, which take effect on oct 8, just before the congress is due to begin, will cover platforms provided by china s internet titans, such as tencent s wechat and qq, baidu s tieba and alibaba s alipay chat. the regulations also require companies to establish a credit system, and to provide group chat services to users in accordance to their credit rating, cac said. chat group participants who break the rules will see their credit scores lowered, their rights to manage group chats suspended or revoked and should be reported to the relevant government department, it added. the cac did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent after office hours on thursday. the administration also said the owner of the chat group should bear responsibility for the management of the group. whoever owns the group should be responsible, and whoever manages the group should be responsible, it said. the new rules are the latest requirement for china s internet giants, who have already been subject to investigations from the cac into their top social media sites for failing to comply with cyber laws. the administration has already taken down popular celebrity gossip social media accounts and extended restrictions on what news can be produced and distributed by online platforms, and has embarked on a campaign to remove virtual private network apps, which allow users to access websites blocked by the authorities.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.190000000000001,4.0,0.0,0.0

donald trump: press lying about inauguration crowd size,"president donald trump told the central intelligence agency (cia) at their headquarters in langley, virginia, on saturday that he is engaged in “a running war” with the “dishonest media,” noting that their latest lies include misleading reports about the size of the crowd at his ceremony on friday.[ “and the reason you’re my first stop is that, as you know, i have a running war with the media. they are among the most dishonest human beings on earth,” trump said. the approximately 400 cia employees broke out into applause after trump said this. in addition to making it seem, falsely, like he was in a feud with the intelligence community, trump said the media “showed an empty field” during his inauguration. “we had a massive field of people. you saw that, packed,” trump said. he then noted that when he woke up saturday morning, he turned on the tv and noticed, “i get up this morning, i turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. i said, wait a minute. i made a speech. i looked out. the field was, it looked like a million — a million and a half people. they showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. and they said, ‘donald trump did not draw well. ’” he added, “we have something that’s amazing because we had it looked — honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. whatever it was, it was. but it went all the way back to the washington monument. and i turn on [the tv] and by mistake i get this network, and it showed an empty field. ” “so, we caught them,” he said. “and we caught them in a beauty, and i think they’re going to pay a big price. ” trump went on to note yet another lie perpetuated by the media. specifically, zeke miller of time magazine falsely reported that trump removed the bust of dr. martin luther king, jr. from the oval office. the bust of the esteemed, late civil rights leader was never removed. (president barack obama had removed the bust of winston churchill from the oval office shortly after he moved in and replaced it with mlk jr. ’s). “in the oval office, there’s a beautiful statue of dr. martin luther king,” trump said. “and, i also happen to like churchill … he doesn’t come from our country, but had a lot do with it. he helped us, real ally. ” trump had requested that churchill’s bust be replaced in the oval office upon his move into the white house. “but there was a cameraman that was right in front of it. so zeke, zeke from time magazine” wrote a fake news story, trump said. “i would never do that. i have great respect for dr. martin luther king. and it was right there. but this is how dishonest the media is. ” trump added, “i love honesty. i like honest reporting. ” and finally, he told the cia, “i love you. i respect you. there’s nobody i respect more. you’re going to do a fantastic job. and we are going to start winning again, and you are going to lead the charge. thank you. i’ll be back. ” white house press secretary sean spicer also pointed out the lies perpetuated by the media during his emergency press conference saturday. “some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,” spicer said. “photographs of the inauguration proceeding were intentionally framed in a way to minimize the enormous support it had gathered on the national mall,” he said. he noted earlier how miller of time magazine “falsely tweeted out that the bust of mlk, jr. had been removed from the oval office. “this was just plain wrong. ”",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.655000000000001,8.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
briton pleads guilty to weapons charge over trump rally incident,"(reuters) - a british tourist who caused a security scare at a donald trump campaign rally in las vegas in june by trying to grab a gun from a police officer pleaded guilty on tuesday to charges of illegal weapon possession and disorderly conduct, court papers showed. michael steven sandford, 20, admitted as part of his plea deal with prosecutors that he had approached a policeman at the event, saying he wanted an autograph from the presidential candidate, then tried to pull the officer’s gun from his holster with both hands, the papers said. sandford, who had by then overstayed his tourist visa by about 10 months, was immediately arrested and removed from the rally. he also acknowledged having visited a las vegas gun range the day before the june 18 incident at the treasure island casino-hotel, to take shooting lessons with a rented glock handgun, firing 20 rounds at a paper target, court papers showed. no mention was made in the plea agreement about whether sandford intended to harm trump, then the presumptive republican nominee in the u.s. presidential race. in the initial june 20 criminal complaint stemming from the incident, prosecutors said sandford had told a u.s. secret service agent he had driven to las vegas from california with the aim of shooting trump. on june 29, sandford was charged with felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business, but he was not accused of plotting to kill trump. at tuesday’s hearing in federal court in las vegas, sandford pleaded guilty to those two charges, each of which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the u.s. attorney’s office said in a statement. sentencing is scheduled for dec. 13. brenda weksler, one of sandford’s federal public defenders, declined to comment.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,8.0,0.1,0.0

"president of planned parenthood compared to isis, the mob and drug dealers","because the rabidly insane american right wing is no stranger to hyperbole and nonsense comparisons, fr. frank pavone, an anti-choice fanatic, has compared cecile richards, the president of planned parenthood to terrorists, mobsters and drug lords. why? because she was invited to speak at georgetown university by some of the students and letting planned parenthood speak is just plain crazy!while on an am hate radio show, pavone let loose with this gem:he said he didn t buy the argument that inviting someone like richards to speak was allowing inquiry into all different positions. i mean, do we inquire, do we try to understand terrorism by inviting representatives of isis to come and speak? he asked. or let s get some of the biggest drug dealers in the country to come and talk about their business because, after all, we have to understand both sides of the issue of drug abuse. why don t we invite the biggest mobsters to come in because we have to understand both sides of the debate about organized crime? are they doing that? maybe i m missing it, but do these universities invite these kinds of people too? what pavone is actually saying is that the only side we should be listening to is the one that says a fertilized egg is a person and that baby jesus cries whenever a hell-bound baby killer abortion doctor performs an abortion. also, that abortion is the moral equivalent of terrorism. that would be a perfectly reasonable argument to make except for the fact that it s pure bullshit.the burning desire for conservative christians to impose their religious doctrine on the entire country is never more clear than in the abortion debate. i say debate because there really isn t one. the pro-life movement is all about control and, for the most part, completely unconcerned with what happens to the precious life they re willing to murder to defend. the pro-choice movement, on the other hand, is perfectly fine with common sense restrictions placed on late-term abortions, a fact that theocratic monsters refuse to acknowledge.normally, what pavone said would be just the ravings of a madman, but these are not normal times. the right has whipped up such a storm of hate and rage against planned parenthood that violence is both inevitable and ongoing. this kind of rhetoric only increases the chances that someone will declare themselves a soldier of god and lash out. shootings, arson, death threats and all other manner of terrorism have been a common occurance in a country that s supposedly at war with terrorism. but i guess as long as the terrorism is white and christian, it s acceptable. murika.featured image via getty",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.773333333333333,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0
are trump supporters too dumb to know they’re dumb? science says “probably”,"how the hell can anybody call themselves intelligent when they re supporting donald trump? it s a question that baffles people who are able to think critically, able to read and comprehend both history and current events, and able to see through trump s thin fa ade of know-it-all-ism and deep into what he is an ignorant, narcissistic, and dangerous conman.trump supporters not only don t see this, they re happy that there s someone running for president that thinks exactly like them. take melanie austin, of brownsville, pennsylvania. she thought her beliefs about obama being a gay muslim from kenya and michelle being transgender were just fringe beliefs right up until she started hearing similar stuff from trump and other right-wing extremists.now she knows she s right about all of this. you can t tell her that she s ignorant and dumb if she can t figure this out for herself. you can t tell her she s delusional. you can sit there with her, and countless others like her, and present facts, figures, charts, studies, and more, all from the most reputable sources there are, and prove that her lord and savior is wrong, and you ll still get shot down.there s more to this than the problem of confirmation bias. austin gets much of her information from fringe right-wing blogs and conspiracy sites, but that s not all of it. many of trump s supporters are seriously too dumb to know they re dumb. it s called the dunning-kruger effect, and it s an unshakeable illusion that you re much smarter, and more skilled and/or knowledgeable, than you really are.people like austin labor under the illusion that their knowledge about things is at least as good as, if not better than, the actual facts. for these people, though, their knowledge isn t just superior it s superior even to those who have intimate and detailed knowledge of the subject at hand. trump himself has exemplified this countless times, such as when he claimed he knows more about isis than even our military generals do.his fans simply take his word for it, and believe that because he knows, they know. they are literally incapable of seeing that they don t know.to be sure, the dunning-kruger effect is present everyone all across the political spectrum, and indeed, in every walk of life. we all overestimate our abilities and knowledge somewhere. however, the effect is especially pronounced in people with limited intellectual and social skills: [p]eople who are unskilled in [intellectual and social domains] suffer a dual burden: not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. so basically, yes, it s possible to be too dumb to realize you re dumb.in four separate studies, people who scored in the bottom quarter on tests involving everything from humor to logic, and even to grammar, grossly overestimated where they thought they would score. they averaged scores in the 12th percentile, while their average estimate of their own scores was the 62nd percentile.the researchers attribute that huge discrepancy to a literal inability to distinguish accuracy from error. or, to put it another way, those who are the most lacking in skills and knowledge are the least able to see it.take the case of mcarthur wheeler, a man who robbed two banks in 1995 and was caught rather easily. he thought he would get away with it because he rubbed his face with lemon juice, which is used in invisible ink. to test the theory that lemon juice would turn him invisible, he rubbed it on his face, took a polaroid, and his face wasn t in the picture! so he thought he was safe from security cameras because he could make his face invisible.he was shocked when police caught him because of that, saying, but i wore the juice. he literally couldn t see the ridiculousness of that line of thought. david dunning, one of the first to catalog the dunning-kruger effect (hence its name), has studied human behavior including voter behavior for decades. he penned an op-ed in politico that explains why this effect is so pronounced in trump s supporters: it suggests that some voters, especially those facing significant distress in their life, might like some of what they hear from trump, but they do not know enough to hold him accountable for the serious gaffes he makes. they fail to recognize those gaffes as missteps. again, the key to the dunning-kruger effect is not that unknowledgeable voters are uninformed; it is that they are often misinformed their heads filled with false data, facts and theories that can lead to misguided conclusions held with tenacious confidence and extreme partisanship, perhaps some that make them nod in agreement with trump at his rallies. trump is completely inept, and his supporters are way too poorly-informed to know that he s inept, and too dumb themselves to know how dumb they are. that s why trump s supporters are so sure they re smart and their president is smart that they won t listen to reason. the effect is strong in these people.featured image by mark wilson/getty images",1,12,0.0,0,1,0,0.0625,3.4666666666666686,9.066666666666668,0.0,0.0
"florida continues for-profit juvenile prisons after years of abuses, corruption","the florida department of juvenile justice has finally decided to terminate its relationship with the for-profit prison company, youth services international, whose name couldn t be more misleading. for years the company has been embroiled in controversies involving covering up youth sex abuses by staff, falsifying records, and starving inmates, among a litany of other allegations occurring over the past few years.the company settled on paying the state of florida $2 million to get a lawsuit thrown out, which they continue to deny has any merit.florida s entire juvenile prison system is privatized, exposing it to abuse and corruption so the companies who hold the government contracts can squeeze out as much profits as possible. despite the rampant problems with youth services international, the state of florida is merely accepting new applications from other for-profit prison companies. these private prisons interfere with the administration of justice. and they re driving inmate populations skyward by corrupting the political process, wrote senator bernie sanders in a huffington post article last year. no one, in my view, should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars whether they re inmates in jail or immigrants held in detention centers. in fact, i believe that private prisons shouldn t be allowed to exist at all, which is why i ve introduced legislation to eliminate them. senator sanders went on to explain how the for-profit prison system facilitates prisoner abuses, harms minorities, victimizes immigrants, influences prison policy and immigration policy while corrupting politicians to favor the interests of the for-profit prison industrial complex. the state of florida has clearly seen the problems posed by placing the management and control of their prison system in the hands of a private company, yet they are continuing to place the livelihood of thousands of teenagers who need help in the hands of companies who just see them as profit. the justice is not for sale act proposed by senator bernie sanders would ban private prisons in america, but in the meantime, states, such as florida need to start taking action on prison reform by not using the criminal justice system as a means for profit.featured image via flickr",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,16.63,28.0,0.0,0.0
u.s. lawmakers aim to comply with iran nuclear deal: eu,"washington (reuters) - u.s. lawmakers signaled they plan to ensure the united states complies with the 2015 iran nuclear deal despite u.s. president donald trump s misgivings about the pact, the european union s foreign policy chief said on tuesday. i got clear indications that the intention is to keep the united states compliant with the agreement, the eu s federica mogherini said at a press conference on a visit to washington. trump on oct. 13 dealt a blow to the pact by refusing to certify that tehran was complying with the accord even though international inspectors said it was. under the deal iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. trump s decision has thrown into doubt the future of the pact negotiated by iran, the eu and six major powers - britain, china, france, germany, russia and the united states. congress has until mid-december to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted under the deal, something few diplomats expect. mogherini sought to avoid publicly becoming embroiled in the u.s. congressional debate about what kind of legislation, if any, to pass even as she stressed the eu s desire to see the united states stick with the nuclear agreement. i made clear any outcome of any process ... has to be, at the end of the day, compliant with the deal, mogherini said. she said she had voiced her readiness to help lawmakers find solutions that are compatible with u.s. compliance under the agreement. separately, the head of the u.n. nuclear watchdog told reporters it would be a pity if iran were to cease to provisionally implement the additional protocol, which gives the agency more tools to verify a country s nuclear compliance. the additional protocol is the most ... important tool for us in the verification. so if it happens, it s a pity, said international atomic energy agency director general yukiya amano. under the 2015 deal, iran agreed to provisionally implement the additional protocol. amano told reporters that if iran were to discontinue the protocol, the iaea would not be able to get access to undeclared potential nuclear sites. amano said that on a visit to iran last month, iranian officials had assured him they would continue implementing the nuclear deal and would not be the first to abandon it. the additional protocol was created in the 1990s as a way to smoke out covert, arms-related activities after the discovery of iraq s secret nuclear weapons program and revelations that north korea and romania had separated plutonium. asked if the iranians had given him any sign that they might abandon the additional protocol, amano replied: they don t say what will happen, but anything can happen. that is my sense.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,12.0,0.0,0.0
the case of hongxiang and the us pressure on china | new eastern outlook,"n20160922000251315.html ). we prohibit everything unless it can be demonstrated conclusively that it is to support humanitarian purposes.” in this context, the usa and china are engaged in another conflict related to coal trade between beijing and pyongyang. the usa is trying to stop this supply but, as the official representative of the foreign affairs ministry of china geng shuang announced on september 28, this trade has been carried out in accordance with the regulations and resolutions, as well as the national laws and regulations of the prc, and does not violate international law and un resolutions on sanctions against pyongyang, which permits the coal trade with the north. this statement was made in response to the speech of the assistant us secretary of state daniel russel who announced that the usa was working to block the loopholes the north used to obtain foreign currency. in this context, russel noted that the north had earned 1 billion dollars from coal sales to china every year, which was a third of the total sum of north korean exports. however, an item on the possible export of the north korean coal was included in the un security council resolution with due account for china’s opinion. while the south is trying to present the case so that the resolution 2270 adopted by the un security council in march 2016 generally prohibits the import of north korean coal, it actually concerns a ban on the supply that provides income that could be used for the development of nuclear and missile programs. as a result, the export volume of coal to china is increasing. on september 24, the japanese nihon keizai shinbun published an article, which stated that the import volume of coal from north korea to china sharply dropped by 38% in april 2016 when compared to the same period of the previous year, and this trend had lasted until july. however, this indicator started to grow in august having increased by 27.5% year-on-year. the overall trade volume between north korea and china has also increased by 30%. south korean experts believe that the restoration of imports of north korean goods to china has taken place due to the chinese government relaxing its level of control, which reflects their dissatisfaction with thaad missile defense system placement on the korean peninsula. thus, the attempt to dictate unilateral sanctions to beijing has failed so far. in addition, they often emphasize that “beijing opposes unilateral sanctions that do not help in solving the issue.” this was announced on september 15 by the foreign affairs minister of china wang yi during a telephone conversation with his japanese colleague fumio kishida. the same position was expressed on september 22 during a meeting with the special representatives of china’s and the republic of korea’s governments, where they discussed countermeasures in respect of the fifth nuclear test conducted by pyongyang. the south korean party is reported to have demanded the adoption of stricter sanctions against pyongyang from china, including the ban of the land transportation of cargo, but china refused. the concealed disagreement was reflected in the statement made by the un general secretary ban ki-moon who expressed his dissatisfaction with the delay in the adoption of additional sanctions in response to the fifth nuclear test of the dprk. he stated that the un security council had spent too much time on it. meanwhile, china’s attitude in respect of the sanctions against the north is quite clear. according to a report by a senior research fellow of the sejong institute chun jae-hon presented at the forum in seoul “korean unification and security issues”, china is not willing to support the sanctions against the dprk, which will result in the fall of the current regime and deterioration of the living standards of north koreans. according to the speaker, the fall of kim jong-un regime “is fraught with unpredictable consequences,” including integration of the both koreas under the guidance of seoul. beijing does not want a united korea, that would be an ally of the usa, to appear in on its border and it will do everything possible to prevent it. in fact, the chinese government has restricted the level of sanctions in respect of pyongyang all the while implementing the un resolutions and not exceeding them by imposing additional unilateral measures, as the united states or its allies do. and it will not go beyond this level under any circumstance. konstantin asmolov, ph.d. in history, chief research fellow at the center for korean studies of the institute of far eastern studies of the russian academy of sciences, exclusively for the online magazine “ new eastern outlook ”.",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.726153846153846,8.276923076923078,0.0,0.0
kentucky clerk opposed to gay marriage to run for 2018 re-election,"louisville, ky. (reuters) - the kentucky county clerk who drew worldwide attention for her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples two years ago will run for re-election next year, her attorney said on tuesday. rowan county clerk kim davis will run to retain her seat in 2018 despite suggestions from some people that she run for a higher local or statewide political position, said mat staver, founder of liberty counsel. davis spent five days in jail in september 2015 after refusing a court order to issue marriage licenses following the supreme court’s decision legalizing same-sex marriage. davis claimed same-sex marriage went against her apostolic christian beliefs. staver’s organization represented davis in the resulting lawsuit filed by four couples against her. “she’s not interested in any other office,” staver said. last month, davis and a representative of liberty counsel traveled to romania, where those against same-sex marriage seek a referendum on the issue this fall, to meet with religious and political leaders, staver said. davis’ case in 2015 drew hundreds of protesters and supporters to her office in morehead, in rural eastern kentucky. while she was in jail, then-republican presidential candidates mike huckabee and ted cruz visited her. less than a month after she was released from jail, davis, who won election to the office in 2014 as a democrat, changed her affiliation to the republican party. rowan county democratic party officials could not be reached for comment. prior to her election, davis served as a deputy to her mother, jean bailey, who served as the county clerk for nearly four decades. after her case, kentucky lawmakers removed all county clerks’ names from the state marriage license form. a federal judge later ruled that while the new law made the suits against her moot, the couples’ attorneys were still entitled to legal fees. the earliest davis will be able to file for re-election is wednesday, according to the kentucky secretary of state’s office.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
"russian communists drop veteran, select surprise candidate to challenge putin","moscow (reuters) - the russian communist party on saturday unexpectedly dropped its veteran leader gennady zyuganov as its presidential candidate to challenge president vladimir putin next year, choosing instead a largely unknown businessman with links to the farm sector. zyuganov, 73, an evergreen of the post-soviet political scene, had been widely expected to contest his sixth consecutive presidential election next march. but instead the party picked pavel grudinin, 57, a mechanical engineer who has run a farm on the outskirts of moscow since the mid-1990s, as its candidate to take on putin in an election which the 65-year-old kremlin leader is expected to win comfortably. zyuganov congratulated grudinin on his nomination at an annual gathering of the party on saturday, the communist party said on its website. by ditching one of the communist old guard as candidate and choosing someone from a new generation, the party appeared to be attempting to widen its political appeal. its main support base has been from an age group that is fast disappearing. speaking at the meeting where grudinin was nominated, zyuganov said voter apathy, which many independent analysts say is on the rise, was now russia s biggest misfortune . the communists came second after the ruling party united russia, which backs putin, in parliamentary elections in 2016 - but winning only 19.2 percent of the vote. separately on saturday, united russia pledged its full support for putin in what is expected to be a one-sided presidential contest.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.09,16.0,0.0,0.1
emails show obama’s epa planned to let flint residents drink poison water until 2016,"it s fascinating that even before any facts related to the flint water crisis were available, the hollywood liberal elite and leftist s across america were calling for the head of michigan s republican governor. now that the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to a corrupt and incompetent epa along with incompetent democrat public officials in flint, mi., will the media start correctly placing the blame where it belongs? watch big mouth activist michael moore attempting to inject his rancor into the flint water crisis, as a way to draw attention to himself and place blame on republican governor rick snyder instead of the actual culprit, the incompetent epa:four months after being notified about high lead levels in a flint home, the environmental protection agency was prepared to let the city continue giving lead-contaminated water to customers until at least 2016, emails released friday show.jennifer crooks, the michigan program manager for the epa s drinking water state revolving fund, sent out an agenda on june 8, 2015, for a planned call with michigan department of environmental quality officials.in that email, crooks said it was known that flint had not been adding any corrosion-control chemicals to its water to prevent lead from leaching from the pipes into drinking water since april 2014. she said the city was in its second six-month testing period.it didn t make sense for the city to start a corrosion control program in june 2015, crooks wrote. since flint has lead service lines, we understand some citizen-requested lead sampling is exceeding the action level, and the source of drinking water will be changing again in 2016, so to start a corrosion control study now doesn t make sense, crooks wrote. the idea to ask flint to simply add phosphate may be premature; there are many other issues and factors that must be taken into account which would require a comprehensive look at the water quality and the system before any treatment recommendations can/should be made. the email was sent almost four months after epa researcher miguel del toral was made aware of high lead in flint s water.via: washington examiner",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.255714285714287,11.314285714285715,0.0,0.0
fbi fear of leaks drove decision on emails linked to clinton: sources,"washington (reuters) - fbi director james comey was driven in part by a fear of leaks from within his agency when he decided to tell congress the fbi was investigating newly discovered emails related to hillary clinton, law enforcement sources said on thursday. the examination of the email traffic is now being carried out under the tightest secrecy by a team at federal bureau of investigations headquarters in washington, the sources said, requesting anonymity because of the inquiry’s sensitivity. several sources said it was unclear whether the fbi would make any further public disclosures about its latest review before tuesday’s presidential and congressional elections. two sources said such disclosures were unlikely. another source, recently in contact with top investigators, said: “it depends on how it goes and what they find.” the source said that, as of thursday, “nobody really knows” whether the fbi will have anything further to say before the election. dropping like a bombshell on the u.s. presidential campaign, comey’s disclosure last friday in a letter to senior lawmakers just days before the elections raised questions about his motives and drew criticism from some over his timing. comey disclosed that the fbi was looking at emails as part of a probe into clinton’s use of a private email system while secretary of state, without describing the emails’ content or how long the inquiry might take. the fbi normally does not comment on ongoing inquiries. the latest emails examination was moving forward “expeditiously,” said one source close to the review. the new emails turned up as fbi investigators were examining electronic devices used by former democratic representative anthony weiner in connection with an alleged “sexting” scandal. weiner’s estranged wife, huma abedin, is a clinton confidante. two law enforcement sources familiar with the fbi’s new york field office, which initially discovered the emails, said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to hillary clinton. a spokeswoman for the fbi’s new york office said she had no knowledge about this. democratic party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing fbi investigation of the clinton foundation. the fbi has made preliminary inquiries into clinton foundation activities and alleged contacts between trump and associates with parties in russia, according to law enforcement sources. but these inquiries were shifted into low gear weeks ago because the fbi wanted to avoid any impact on the election. the fbi previously had spent about a year investigating clinton’s use of the unauthorized server at her home in chappaqua, new york, instead of the state department system after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails. comey had said in july that while there was “evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.”",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.773333333333333,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0

south african supreme court upholds reinstating 783 corruption charges against zuma,"bloemfontein, south africa (reuters) - south africa s supreme court of appeal on friday upheld a high court ruling to reinstate nearly 800 corruption charges filed against jacob zuma before he became president. zuma, who has faced and denied numerous other corruption allegations since taking office, said he was disappointed by the court s decision and asked the national prosecuting authority (npa) to consider representations before deciding whether to proceed against him. it was unclear when the npa would make a decision on the charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s. the ruling is likely to amplify calls for zuma, 75, to step down before his term as president ends in 2019 and diminish his influence over who succeeds him when the ruling african national congress (anc) chooses a new leader in december. it is going to make it a lot more difficult for his camp to get their presidential candidate elected, said gary van staden, political analyst with nkc african economics. friday s unanimous supreme court ruling upheld a high court decision in april 2016 that the charges against zuma should be reinstated. they had been set aside in april 2009 by the then-head of the prosecuting authority, paving the way for zuma to run for president later that year. rejecting an appeal brought by zuma and the npa, judge lorimer leach said it was irrational for the npa to have set the charges aside the same word used by the high court. it is difficult to understand why the present regime at the npa considered that the decision to terminate the prosecution could be defended, the supreme court s leach said. npa spokesman luvuyo mfaku said prosecutors would need to consider the judgment but would at all times do the right thing within the confines of the rule of law and in the interest of proper administration of justice . in a separate statement, the npa said zuma s lawyers had asked the state prosecutor not to serve an indictment on his client nor to re-enrol the matter prior to the representations having been considered . the prospect that zuma s removal may be inching closer lifted the rand against the dollar. zuma is unpopular with many investors after sacking respected finance minister pravin gordhan in march, a move that hit south african financial assets and helped tip the country s credit ratings into junk territory. zuma has faced persistent corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest his friends the gupta family may have used their influence to secure lucrative state contracts for their companies. reuters has not independently verified the emails, and zuma and the guptas have consistently denied any wrongdoing. mmusi maimane, leader of the main opposition democratic alliance, said he would write to the national director of public prosecutions, shaun abrahams, to demand he indict zuma. the charges have been formulated and the evidence is ready. we now await a trial date, maimane told reporters. asked by reporters whether zuma should resign, the african national congress (anc) secretary general gwede mantashe said the party would allow that process to take its course. the first thing is whether the npa will decide to charge the president, he said. you re putting the cart before the horse. national prosecutor mokotedi mpshe s decision in 2009 to drop the 783 charges against zuma in what has become known as the spy tapes case was based on phone intercepts presented by zuma s legal team. they suggested the timing of the charges in late 2007 may have been part of a political plot to stop zuma, then deputy president, running for the top job. zuma was linked to the 1990s arms deal through his former financial adviser, who was jailed for corruption. analysts said the credibility of zuma and the npa were in question after the ruling. one lawyer, ulrich roux, who speaks to media as a legal analyst, said a private prosecution could be instituted if charges are not brought.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.372727272727271,15.30909090909091,0.0,0.0
sex bombshell exposed after hillary couldn’t hide what she did back in 2011,"sex bombshell exposed after hillary couldn’t hide what she did back in 2011 posted on october 31, 2016 by robert rich in politics share this hillary clinton is backpedaling these days, but her past isn’t making things any easier on her. in fact, it seems that her dirty deeds from 2011 just came to the surface in the form of a sex bombshell – and not even she could hide it forever. with the fbi reopening its investigation into hillary’s emails and private server, on account of another case into anthony weiner’s sexting of an alleged minor, it seems that there are some startling details coming forward. although we all know that weiner is a long-time pervert and sexual predator, it looks like things have been going on for longer than we thought – and hillary knew about it all along. everyone who knew anthony weiner targeted underage girls back in 2011: john podesta, neera tanden, and hillary clinton (left), and jennifer palmieri (right) according to mail online , hillary’s camp knew that weiner was talking to and sending sexually graphic images to an underage girl all the way back in 2011, yet they did nothing to stop him. in fact, jennifer palmieri, the campaign communications director in 2011, sent an email to john podesta, now chair of clinton’s presidential campaign, and neera tanden, another clinton adviser, detailing weiner’s predatory and criminal behavior. married to hillary’s current top aide, huma abedin, at the time, weiner’s indiscretions were made public knowledge to hillary’s camp and only met with a mere “oof” from podesta. further reports indicate that police were sent to the 17-year-old girl’s home at the time to interview both the child and her parents. anthony weiner and his sex pics of course, as we all know now, weiner has come under official investigation after sending lewd messages to a different 15-year-old girl more recently. however, one can only wonder if weiner’s most recent victim could have been spared if his predatory behavior was addressed back in 2011 rather than swept under the rug. although he’s been widely deemed the black sheep of the political realm, it certainly appears that his divorce and early resignation was the least of concern pertaining to the fallout of his behavior. seeing how the most recent of weiner’s consequences just slapped hillary, it doesn’t take much to imagine the hell he’s living in right now. anthony weiner and steamy messages he sent to a woman other than his wife however, it is good to have these things out in the open as it helps show the true hillary clinton – the one she never wanted you to know about. there’s no question that hillary would do whatever it took to remain in power, but this is just ridiculous. because of her neglect and the blind eye turned by her staff, an underage girl was allowed to be victimized because the truth would have a negative effect on them. there really is no jail cell that’s suited for what hillary deserves but she will most certainly have to answer for her misdeeds after she’s dead and gone from this earth – and suffering for an eternity sounds rather fitting for the vile things she’s done.",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.07142857142857142,6.726153846153846,8.276923076923078,0.0,0.0
u.s. congress members decry 'ethnic cleansing' in myanmar; suu kyi doubts allegations,"yangon/naypyitaw (reuters) - members of the u.s. congress said on tuesday operations carried out against the rohingya muslims in myanmar had “all the hallmarks” of ethnic cleansing, while the country’s leader aung san suu kyi expressed doubts about allegations of rights abuses. the u.s. senate members also said they were disturbed by a “violent and disproportionate” security response to rohingya militant attacks that have driven more than 600,000 people from myanmar to neighbouring bangladesh. human rights monitors have accused myanmar’s military of atrocities, including mass rape, against the stateless rohingya during so-called clearance operations following insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. myanmar’s government has denied most of the claims, and the army last week said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. “we are not hearing of any violations going on at the moment,” suu kyi told reporters in response to a question about human rights abuses at the end of the asia-europe meeting, or asem, in myanmar’s capital naypyitaw. “we can’t say whether it has happened or not. as a responsibility of the government, we have to make sure that it won’t happen.” nobel laureate suu kyi said she hoped talks with bangladesh’s foreign minister this week would lead to a deal on the “safe and voluntary return” of those who have fled. suu kyi’s less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under myanmar’s transition to power after decades of military rule. while a top un official has described the military’s actions as a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing”, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on a visit to myanmar last week refused to label it as such. in early november, u.s. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on myanmar military officials. democratic senator jeff merkley, who was among the sponsors of the legislation introduced in the senate, led a congressional delegation that visited rakhine this week, but was blocked from traveling to the violence-hit north of the state and to rohingya camps. the group also traveled to cox’s bazar district in bangladesh, where rohingya refugees are huddled into makeshift camps and fed by overstretched aid agencies. “many refugees have suffered direct attacks including loved ones, children and husbands being killed in front of them, wives and daughters being raped, burns and other horrific injuries. this has all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing,” merkley told reporters in myanmar on tuesday. “we are profoundly disturbed by the violent and disproportionate response against the rohingya by the military and local groups,” he said. the delegation called for myanmar to allow an investigation into the alleged atrocities that would involve the international community. “we want to emphasize that the world is watching,” merkley said, adding that it was important myanmar allow anyone who wants to come back to return to their homes and their farms. merkley said the delegation was “not here today to recommend…what the u.s. government would do or should do,” when asked about the legislation introduced in the congress. myanmar officials have so far said they plan to resettle most returnees in new “model villages”, rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach the united nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps. “individuals cannot be coming back…simply to return to camps where there would be continued discrimination, restrictions on full participation in the economy and society,” said merkley. he warned that isolating people in camps creates a “two-tier society that is fundamentally incompatible with the future of democracy and it guarantees perpetuation of suspicions and misunderstandings and conflicts.” speaking earlier on tuesday, suu kyi said discussions would be held with the bangladesh foreign minister on wednesday and thursday about repatriation. officials from both countries began talks last month on how to process the rohingya wanting to return. “we hope that this would result in an mou signed quickly, which would enable us to start the safe and voluntarily return of all of those who have gone across the border,” suu kyi said. the rohingya are largely stateless and many people in myanmar view them as illegal immigrants from bangladesh. suu kyi said myanmar would follow the framework of an agreement reached in the 1990s to cover the earlier repatriation of rohingya, who had fled to bangladesh to escape previous bouts of ethnic violence. that agreement did not address the citizenship status of rohingya, and bangladesh has been pressing for a repatriation process that provided rohingya with more safeguards this time. “it’s on the basis of residency...this was agreed by the two governments long time ago with success, so this will be formula we will continue to follow,” suu kyi said. earlier talks between the two countries reached a broad agreement to work out a repatriation deal, but a senior myanmar official later accused bangladesh of dragging its feet in order to secure funding from aid agencies for hosting the refugees.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.706666666666667,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0

alec baldwin at war with producer over underage sex scene claims,"an war has broken out on social media between alec baldwin and film producer dana brunetti over claims that the actor did not know actress nikki reed was underage when she and baldwin filmed sex scenes for the 2006 movie mini’s first time.

u.n. evacuates first group of refugees from libya to niger,"tunis (reuters) - a group of 25 refugees have been evacuated from libya to niger to have resettlement claims processed, in the first operation of its kind from the north african country, the united nations said on sunday. the move is part of efforts to provide protection for refugees and other vulnerable migrants who travel to libya, often intending to attempt the dangerous sea crossing to italy. many are trapped in smuggling networks or detention centers where they are exposed to a range of abuses including rape and torture that have been widely documented by human rights organizations and u.n. agencies. about 43,000 refugees and asylum seekers registered by u.n. refugee agency unhcr are now in libya. it is hard to resettle refugees directly from libya partly because most countries closed their embassies in tripoli after fighting escalated there in 2014. the initial group evacuated by air from tripoli to niamey on saturday was made up of 15 women, six men and four children from eritrea, ethiopia and sudan, according to the united nations. today s evacuation symbolizes hope in finding safe solutions for vulnerable refugees in libya, roberto mignone, the unhcr representative for libya, said in a statement. the operation was the result of a joint initiative by unhcr and the governments of libya and niger, and niger has agreed to host the group until their claims to be resettled in third countries are dealt with, it said. we hope to be able to carry out more evacuations in the near future, said vincent cochetel, unhcr s special envoy for the central mediterranean. but he said the scheme would remain limited in scale as long as commitments to resettle refugees remained insufficient . these refugee evacuations can only be part of broader asylum-building and migration management efforts to address the complex movement of migrants and refugees who embark on perilous journeys across the sahara desert and the mediterranean sea, he said. most migrants traveling through libya towards europe come from sub-saharan african countries. many fleeing poverty, repression or conflict journey across the desert through niger, algeria or sudan. the libya to italy crossing has become the main migrant route to europe since an agreement between the eu and turkey shut down smuggling through greece last year. more than 600,000 have crossed by boat to italy since 2014. european states have pledged tens of millions of euros to libya, niger and migrants countries of origin in an effort to stem the flows. departures from libya have dropped since july due to changes in smuggling activity and increased activity by libya s european-backed coastguard. european policy has drawn criticism from human rights groups that say it traps migrants in libya, exposing them to further abuse there. unhcr is seeking to open a refugee transit center in tripoli early next year to shelter some of the most vulnerable refugees as they await evacuation or resettlement. the international organization for migration carries out voluntary repatriations of migrants from libya, flying home more than 10,600 so far this year.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,16.0,0.0,0.0
re: 55 reasons why california is the worst state in america,"55 reasons why california is the worst state in america december 12th, 2012 why in the world would anyone want to live in the state of california at this point? the entire state is rapidly becoming a bright, shining example of everything that is wrong with america. it is so sad to watch our most populated state implode right in front of our eyes. like millions of americans, i was quite enamored with the state of california when i was younger. the warm weather, the beaches, the great natural beauty of the state and the mystique of hollywood all really appealed to me. at one point i even thought that i wanted to move there. but today, hordes of californians are racing to get out of the state because it has become a total nightmare. it is the worst state in the country in which to do business, taxes were just raised even higher, unemployment is more than 20 percent higher than the national average and the state government is drowning in debt. meanwhile, poverty, gang activity and crime just seem to get worse with each passing year. on top of everything else, the insane politicians in sacramento just keep on passing more laws that make the problems that the state is facing even worse. unfortunately, what is happening in california may be a preview of what is coming to the entire nation. the old adage, “as california goes, so goes the nation”, has been proven to be true way too many times. in dozens of different ways, the state of california is showing the rest of us what not to do. will we learn from their mistakes, or will we follow them into oblivion? please share the list below with as many people as you can. in addition to a large amount of new research, this list also pulled heavily from one of my previous articles and from outstanding research done by richard rider . the following are 55 reasons why california is the worst state in america… 1. one survey of business executives has ranked california as the worst state in america to do business for 8 years in a row . 2. in 2011, the state of california ranked 50th out of all 50 states in new business creation. 3. according to one recent study, california is the worst-governed state in the entire country. 4. thanks to proposition 30 , california now boasts the highest state income tax rate in the nation. 5. even though california just raised taxes dramatically on the wealthy, state revenues are falling like a rock . state revenue for november 2012 was 10.8 percent below projections. 7. california has the 8th highest corporate income tax rate in the country. 8. california has the highest “minimum corporate tax” in the country. each corporation must pay at least $800 to the state even if a corporation does not make a single dollar of profit. 9. california is tied with new york for the highest gasoline tax rate in the country. 10. california is the only state in america that taxes carbon emissions . 11. the state of california issues some of the most expensive traffic tickets in the nation. this is another form of taxation. 12. as of october, only nevada and rhode island had higher unemployment rates than california. 13. the unemployment rate in california is more than 20 percent higher than the overall unemployment rate for the rest of the nation. 14. the state of california requires licenses for 177 different occupations (the most in the nation). the national average is only 92. 15. california teachers are the highest paid in the nation, but california students rank 48th in math and 49th in reading . 16. california accounts for 12 percent of the u.s. population, but a whopping 33 percent of americans that receive tanf (temporary assistance for needy families) live there. 17. only the state of illinois has a lower bond rating than the state of california does. 18. including unfunded pension liabilities, the state of california has more than twice as much debt as any other state does. 19. average pay for california state workers has risen by more than 100 percent since 2005. that is good news for those state employees, but it is bad news for the taxpayers that have to pay their salaries. 20. more than 5,000 california state troopers made more than $100,000 last year. 21. one highway patrol officer ended up bringing home almost $484,000 in 2011. 22. one state psychiatrist in california was paid $822,000 in 2011. 23. since 2007, the number of children living in poverty in the state of california has increased by 30 percent . 24. sadly, an astounding 60 percent of all students attending california public schools now qualify for free or reduced-price school lunches. 25. the american tort reform association has ranked the state of california as the worst “judicial hellhole” in america. 26. businesses all over the state of california are being absolutely suffocated to death by ridiculous regulations. 27. according to the milken institute, operating costs for california businesses are 23 percent higher than the national average. 28. according to cnn , the state of california had the worst “small business failure rate” in america in 2010. it was 69 percent higher than the national average. 29. the number of people unemployed in the state of california is roughly equivalent to the populations of nevada, new hampshire and vermont combined . 30. residential customers in california pay about 29 percent more for electricity than the national average. 31. so many poor people and illegal aliens have taken advantage of the “free” healthcare at emergency rooms that many of them have been forced to shut down in california. as a result, the state of california now ranks dead last out of all 50 states in the number of emergency rooms per million people. 32. political correctness is totally out of control in california. 33. one california town is actually considering making it illegal to smoke in your own backyard . 34. the traffic around the big cities is horrific. 35. los angeles 40. the rampant gang activity in the state gets even worse with each passing year. 41. crime continues to rise all over the state. 42. just recently, the city attorney of san bernardino, california told citizens to “ lock their doors and load their guns ” because there is not enough money to pay for adequate police protection any longer. 43. the murder rate in san bernardino is up 50 percent this year. 44. in oakland, burglaries are up 43 percent so far this year. 45. today, oakland is considered the 5th most violent city in the united states. 46. there have been more than 250 gold chain robberies in stockton, california just since the month of april. 47. in stockton, the police budget cuts got so bad that the police union put up a billboard at one point with the following message : “welcome to the 2nd most dangerous city in california. stop laying off cops.” 48. jerry brown. 49. the absolutely insane california state legislature. 50. wildfires. 51. mudslides. 52. the state of california lies directly along the infamous “ ring of fire “. approximately 90 percent of all the earthquakes in the entire world happen along the ring of fire and the “big one” could hit the state at any moment. 53. according to the u.s. census bureau, approximately 100,000 more people moved out of the state of california in 2011 than moved into it. 54. during 2011, more than 58,000 people moved from california to the state of texas . 55. overall, the state of california has experienced a net loss of about four million residents to other states over the past 20 years. sorry protesters: your jobs are being sent to china and they aren’t coming back » mark we left california in 2001. that was the best move we ever made. california would be a beautiful place with about 5 million people. give then all to texas. mondobeyondo california is a beautiful state. nice place to visit. wouldn’t want to live there though. jagrick it sure is. northern california is about the most beautiful place in this country. i would never want to live in la. i have been there several years ago and it had a creepy feeling so nowadays i assume it’s even worse. san diego back in the 80’s was absolutely beautiful. joseph kool you don’t get out much do you jarrett wilson was going to say the same thing! california is ugly, it’s bests and i mean absolute best is up north. rest is crap the truth yeah yosemite is such crap isn’t it? only perhaps the most beautiful place in the lower 48 but yeah it’s crap. richard depends on where you live. i would avoid the big cities but to be honest the big cities all over the country have trouble. the problem with calif is there are 37,+ million people living here.and there are quite a few big cities!! were over ran with illegals that can’t speak english and there kids are behind because of that, this is the reason our tests scores are so low. i have lived all over the country and calif has it’s bad points but i wouldn’t live any place else. i can be at the beach in 45 min. i can go to the snow in 45 min and leave it there and go to the desert in 45 mins. elect rates are higher but we don’t use as much gas i spent 15 dollars this month can anyone else out of state say that..my elect was 48 dollars and i don’t live in a shack,. i think this blog is a little unfair..i think gasoline is higher in hawaii then new york or calif #41 crime is going up everywhere. #50-51-52 you don’t have to worry about mudslides if you don’t live in the hills. fires, didn’t half of colorado burn down this year how about new mexico.very few fires here this year. earth quakes yep we get them. we don’t get floods very much here and not to many tornado’s. you have your pros and cons handog you can get your point across without using all caps. easier to reed as well. quercus454 as a calif native much of what you say is true. population increases by a mostly low educated foreign population is probably one of the biggest contributors to the state’s decline. while many people rightfully assume that ca is the illegal alien capital of the country, legal immigrants contribute a larger amount towards population growth. with current immigration rules not refining who we allow in, many legal immigrants are not much better educated then the illegal variety. lack of education means lower incomes that pay little in the way of taxes and because an immigrant is legal they are eligible for social services. the children of foreign born immigrants, both legal and illegal often require special esl classes that cost the taxpayer extra. some districts have esl teachers for more then 4 or 5 languages. population growth has rewarded california with over crowded class rooms and failing students. increased population has swamped government resources that were designed to handle a population half today’s size. whether it be social services, infrastructure needs, health care or the judicial system, all have been adversely affected by increased numbers of people. more people needing more resources leads to two things: rising costs and shortages. california is the canary in the coal mine. it is a perfect example of what happens when you continually add more and more people who contribute less then they take. along with feel good government policies to garner votes and the high taxes to support those policies you have california, a failing state. who is to blame? the people of not only california, but the people of the entire country. while the voter’s in ca certainly carry a majority of the blame, immigration is supposedly a federal concern. the federal government is supposed to regulate immigration and secure the border. current and past politicians have neglected and even obstructed meaningful enforcement of immigration laws.the repeated re-election of the same inept/corrupt people has put california in the hole and the rest of the country on the edge. california is a warning. continually electing people who have no regard for the citizens of this country, who place their own careers above what is best, the rest of the country will mirror ca. arizonadiane excellent post. you are so right, and the blame really does go back to our increasingly inept and wasteful federal governement randy townsend ca resident here who agrees with your take on the situation. the government, however, accurately reflects the public’s embrace of the leftist agenda. higher taxes, enormous deficits, and greater spending are exactly what obama is going to give the rest of the country. take a good look, america: ca is your future. liberranter now if only you could keep them confined to the state that they’ve made such a mess of. they made their proverbial bed hard, now let them sleep in it! molon_labe lot of them moving to texas, and immediately try to turn it to commiefornia. so, you move because commieforniai a disaster, and now you wamt to do the same thing here? roaches i tell you. feed and move on is what they do. durgys ramirez totally agree with you on the roaches part. mike mccormack i hope those that try to escape the blight leave behind their voting habits. donald we do vote against this crap but we are over run by voter fraud, illegals and libtard indoctrinated schools. now they just voted for $15 an hour to flip burgers which = junior web developer right out of college. i’m moving to texas because i feel i have better support numbers and don’t feel like such an outkast. by moving to texas i will help make sure libtard philosophies don’t spread to the other states. ps i wasn’t born in california either! plus i love guns! justanoguy and take a look at how many people are bailing out of california. 600,000+ population decrease last year. it’s obviously not working out too well… just to be clear: i’m not endorsing it. as an extreme conservative, i haven’t been represented in government for years. dw your numbers are all wrong. that many may have left, but they were replaced by the 1 mill illegals welcomed in by obama and company. your mama sounds good, lets burn one to celebrate lazyike this is a good commentary. what we have seen is thousands of former midwesterners who moved here after wwii leave and being replaced will illegals from south of the border many of whom are illiterate in spanish and drop out of high school at high rates and reproduce at high rates. sugarsail1 good post, but another major contributor is the same thing that killed detroit; unfunded union pension liabilities is a giant expense as well. unions hijacked the government long ago and we are reaping what we sow. kayaker good grief….you don’t have a freaking clue what’s going on if this is what you actually think. no wonder the country’s in such deep trouble. durgys ramirez totally agree with your post. cherylmeril don’t write in all caps, it’s hard on the eyes. you aren’t being read richard ana hernandez in all honesty, lol. i skipped over your post to. read hers and went back to find out what she was referring to. i don’t care either way, but in my case it was true, i skipped over the post in all caps. sorry. it makes you seem angry so people don’t listen [or read] what you said. honestly…i still haven’t read it.lol richard it is easy for me to type with the cap locks on. broke my pinkie in a motor cycle accident about 14 years ago and it really hurts to reach that shift key with that finger. sorry i have offended so many. i will just type with out it on. of course i won’t capitalize like a lot of you. hope that doesn’t offend anyone. chip wait, you only have one pinkie? or, one of those crappy keyboards, with only one shift key. i don’t like those keyboards – you can’t even type a capital letter if you’ve got a broken pi… oh, wait. (pssss, richard, we won’t tell anybody, but “motor cycle” is one word.) marian i read your post in caps. i didn’t give a hoot how you wrote it. lol…it’s just letters. i was planning on moving there.. was interested to see what people had to say. i already live somewhere with the highest taxes and fuel consumption, but starting a business here is amazing. i figured i’d go there once my business can settle me down. i live in quebec. i don’t capitalize always.if i missed it then it stays lower case. richard sounds good to me. life is to short to worry about the small stuff. danny who the %@#! writes in all caps anymore! i refuse to even read it. justanoguy i love california…. to visit. i live in nevada and visit california all the time but it’s really gone downhill over the past 20 years and i don’t see it getting any better. (quite frankly, i’m visiting less and less nowadays because all of the taxes on everything is going through the roof.) i guess the 600,000+ other people that bailed out of california last year don’t see it getting any better either. rod i was born in socal. family left when i was about to enter elementary school. my two older sisters were already in the horrible schools system with rampant gang activity even back in the mid 60’s! i went back after graduating college to start a career. left again in 1992 and have never looked back. i lived in the bay area (san jose), la area (long beach) and san diego. i will never live there again and do not even like to visit. sugarsail1 i’m a cali native and very disappointed with my home state as well. other than my elderly mother and the nice weather i have no reason to be here and have been looking to move but i don’t know where. i’ve seriously considered mexico…any recommendations? bgenie good for you to never look back. california is all corrupted anyways. willowville the illegals are there to fill the low-wage employment gap. education has little to do with it. there are plenty of college-educated people earning low pay. jordan were over ran with illegals that can’t speak english and there kids are behind because of that, this is the reason our tests scores are so low. really? with this grammar, punctuation, and spelling you are targeting those who are learning a second language as being problematic? work out your past participles, your contractions, the difference between “their” and “there,” and your english syntax in general before you start blaming others for low test scores. andrew taylor broken caps lock key? or do you simply believe bigger=better? personally i find it annoying, grammatically incorrect, lazy and space consuming without a proper reason. i’d have to say i disagree with your logic on california. by agreeing with it i feel like you are agreeing with the problem with this country. uncontrolled debt, corruption, lawful theft and crime is everywhere in california. how can you agree with that? citizenx don’t want you here. thomas moloian and i agree with you since my wife and i stuck here for now but will change within next 5 yrs. davidmpark any chance disnelyland might relocate to a better place? like texas or south utah? it’d make life easier. mondobeyondo maybe phoenix? we could use a decent amusement park around here. i’m tired of hunting lizards as a recreational activity. liberranter what, no rattlesnakes up in your neighborhood to hunt (i didn’t find any this year on my property either)? mleblanc138 i’m happy as long as california doesn’t send their problems and policies up north to utah. slc/provo is about a 10 hour drive away from socal, and yet the two are worlds apart. unfortunately, mexican drug cartels have set up grows on some remote land across southern utah. richard i love socal i wouldn’t live any other place but i live 50 miles east of l.a. in a small ag community. mondobeyondo michael’s human, and being a human being, he has his hits and misses. just like any of the rest of us. believe me, i’ve had some misses as well. not everyone is going to hit a home run 100 percent of the time. san francisco has this reputation for being the liberal capital of america. perhaps that’s true. i don’t know. i’ve never been up there. socal, i know rather well. yeah, it’s different there – from what i understand, los angeles is to san francisco, as phoenix is to flagstaff. same states, vastly different communities. and no, i don’t believe everyone in san francisco is gay or liberal. [common misperception of an entire community]. memadmax up in north california you have all the insane white people, down in the southern areas, you have, basically, mexico… what could possibly go wrong? lololololololol! and yes, i do live there, in van nuys, a sub of los angeles chilller a fence should be erected around ca to keep them all from leaving and bringing their poisonous ideas into texas and other neighboring states. those people moved there because they agreed with ca’s insane ideas. they’re only leaving because they have to but they still have those insane ideas stuck in their heads. syrin amen. we need to wall liberals in their own states and keep people from leaving and destroying their neighbors. up north they’re called massholes. they leave ma, then keep voting democrat in their new haven only to have the same end result. liberals are truly too stupid to understand cause and effect, history, facts, figures or basic economic analysis. bad_mr_frosty we need to put a scarlet letter on liberals so no matter where they go we know who they are and what they stand for. liberranter no tattooing is needed. just spend sixty seconds in the company of one, and you’ll know by what they vomit out of their mouths what kind of creature you’re dealing with. sheryl you’ve hit the nail on the head, syrin (hope that reference isn’t considered too offensive or pc-incorrect, or deemed as promoting toolshed violence, for all you uber liberals out there) zen they have already ruined nevada. my advise is keep them out! they are like a parasite. they have damn near killed their host and so they are leaving it and bringing their liberal disease with them. next thing you know you’re a blue state. justanoguy spot on… they have ruined clark country / las vegas but the backlash has started. libs are not welcomed in nevada. the dude be careful what you wish for. as someone who lived in california i understand the sentiment. living their transformed my political outlook. a poor man can live better in montana, then a rich man can in california. name you know texas doesnt border california, right? mondobeyondo true. it’s sad to see what’s happening on the left coast. syrin when these liberal douche bags come to us for a bail out for their fiscal insanity, all endorsed by gary, that’s when secession talks take on a serious tone. i for one think we should wall in the entire state. we would allow anyone or any business that did not vote for obama or contribute to his campaign to leave. otherwise, they have to stay in their cesspool, and not go pollute their neighboring states, because as we all know, liberals are too stupid to understand cause and effect. we’d allow anyone to enter the state, but leaving would be very very difficult. 2gary2 secession is treason. how many dies in the civil war and now you d-bad repubes want to take your toys and go home. grow the f up. bad_mr_frosty um, stealing all the wealth of the middle class and giving away all the nation’s jobs to chinese and mexicans is treason. if it takes secession or a revolution to end this nightmare, so be it. liberranter please, don’t dignify the moron’s verbal vomiting by arguing with him. it’s beneath us. jobless_1 i don’t know about you, but i sure have a hard time finding a job in california. i don’t think that the state was a place to earn/find a living. i don’t know how to do gangsta stuff either so i suck. i guess i would have to join the military as the ticket out. i would settle in a colony/territory if necessary. sos! one warning, beware of its ripping debt, it’s one of its plagues. handog 58 watch the video. “chief economist says ca. is going in the right direction. lol thanks, i needed a good laugh since i just lost my job recently. the reverse gold rush will turn tx. into ca. it’s a temporary safe haven at best. by the way, if you think the cost of living is cheap here in tx. your in for a rude awakening. rent, food, gas is sky high. toll roads taxing you to death…. liberranter having lived in various localities around the country over the last 30 years, i’ve come to the conclusion that the idea of disparate “costs of living” in amerika is a myth. honestly, i have not seen evidence of significant cost of living differences between, say, arlington, virginia and albuquerque, new mexico. the cost of living anywhere in amerika has become almost prohibitive – thanks in large measure to that moron ben bernanke and his federal reserve counterfeiting machine, aided and abetted by state and local political machines, kalifornia’s being the absolute worst. davethewave i had to comment on your job loss. sorry you got fried. what could the reason be that you were canned. it must be because of your winning positive personality that we have observed. perhaps it was your world views. maybe your ideas on those god given rights you love to spew on about.it must have be great to be with you at lunch. i am sure your former co-workers miss you. handog liberals always use petty insults when they lose a debate. pathetic. davethewave if that comment is all you got then i just handed em to you. you still have not replied to my other question. where can i find out about your god given rights. handog whatever captain kirk. or should i say captain numnuts. lol davethewave you got nothiin get a job! handog i give michael an a + i don’t need statistics on everything. perhaps you were truant the day your 8th grade class talked about the san andreas fault. the one that runs right thru sf. it’s a real threat. erin then get the hell out and give the rest of us our much needed space. oklahoma sounds like a good place for you… richard “17. only the state of illinois has a lower bond rating than the state of california does.” does what?? again, don’t you mean, “only the state of illinois has a lower bond rating than that of california”? richard “18. including unfunded pension liabilities, the state of california has more than twice as much debt as any other state does.” does what?? don’t you mean, “including unfunded pension liabilities, the state of california has more than twice as much debt than that of any other state”? el pollo de oro 2gary2: thanks for that link. thirty years ago, i would have laughed my head off if someone described the usa as a banana republic. now, i call it the banana republic of america because in so many respects, that’s exactly what it has become. as i’ve often said, canadians who want a visit a third world banana republic needn’t travel far. all they have to do is keeping driving south until they cross the border. gerald celente is right: this is an un-developing country. by the way, i noticed that chile is the highest ranking south american country on that list. that makes sense because chile and uruguay are the least banana republic countries in south america (argentina, sadly, shot itself in the foot, like the bra). hoppytoo surely you know that jfk believed that lower taxes result in greater revenue. otter1111 gary, if you just read the article above, you can read about the state the liberals have been in charge of for many years. many of the above facts are due to the liberal policies. california is in no way conservative, it’s pretty much completely run by liberals. just like detroit. this country really hasn’t been run by conservatives either. obama had complete control in his first two years in office, with the house and senate having strong democrat majorities. really bush was not a fiscal conservative, and obama is out of control as far as spending. what policies exactly are you talking about, anyway? and shouldn’t obama have fixed them after 4 years? arizonadiane i was born and raised in pacific beach part of san diego. in the 50’s-70’s it was wonderful. then more people began to move in. who wouldn’t want to live in beautiful san diego. unfortunately, we see the results. especially bad on all the oceanfront properties. can’t even see the ocean. i left there in the 70’s but still had parents there. they moved to the “country”– which is now rancho bernardo. wall to wall houses. i now have no reason to go back because everyone is gone, but the last few times was there, was 2010. horrible traffic, horrible influx of illegals and you name it. it is sad. and then, what idiots put jerry brown in for the 3’rd time? he was the one who started the mess in his first term. some people just don’t get it. cherylmeril san francisco’s a booming city. its politicians are idiots but you shouldn’t have listed this city as a reason why california is the worst state. no credibility. cherylmeril elections may be manipulated with hackers. cherylmeril i agree however san francisco is very dangerous for pedestrian and bicylists injuries and deaths. it’s an epidemic level here, the #1 city for these kind of accidents . cherylmeril the court system in california is full of a lot of corruption, particularly bad is san diego. the courts are also entrapping victims they suspect have money through mentally ill people in a desperate attempt to bring money into the legal community. the courts play politics like never before and anything goes, the law and procedure is secondary much of the time. court’s also rely on those who obviously commit perjury not giving it a second thought. it’s all about cash flow. arizonadiane however, so far none of the cities are looking like detroit, but few may start. the ones that have already gone bankrupt. don’t like california? don’t live here. a far easier solution than whining. don’t be so negative, kurt. remember, “your kind” needs someone to steal from. ingrates that they are, many prosperous people will choose not to pay for your free lunch — and will reluctantly follow your advice. el pollo de oro california is a mess, but then, so is the banana republic of america in general. and california’s woes are not only bad for california—they’re also bad for the rest of the country because california is the world’s 9th largest economy. when an economy of that size is in deep trouble, the pain will be felt thousands of miles away. it’ll be felt here in the northeastern bra 3000 miles away, and for that matter, it’ll be felt in europe. this is a global economic nightmare with one major economy after another sinking into the third world abyss. california’s in trouble, the rest of the bra is in trouble, big chunks of europe are in trouble. all this economy misery around the world will lead to violent unrest, major riots, violent crime galore, political extremism, and world war iii (which might go nuclear). “the presstitutes aren’t reporting this, but there are massive demonstrations going on in spain, in portugal and in greece. tens of millions of people in dozens of different cities are taking to the streets. it’s breaking down worldwide.”—gerald celente yes, it is breaking down worldwide. no doubt. and the worse the misery becomes, the bloodier the future will be. the money, as celente says, is not flowing down to the man in the streets, and the blood will flow in the streets. it will flow like tidal waves. say a prayer for europe and a prayer for the banana republic of america because we need all the help we can get. liberranter …california is the world’s 9th largest economy. amazing that that’s still true, given the lengths to which kalifornians have gone in trying to destroy their own economy. given the deteriorating present conditions, methinks that the “world’s 9th largest economy” standing won’t be true for very much longer. shahhe californians* i hate to be the one to say that, but you can’t even spell. so your not really in the position to be saying what you think is going to happen to california’s standing as the 9th largest economy in the world. alice donati so goes california, so goes the nation? we know that california is too big to fail, so a huge bailout is coming. everyone will get bailed out at the expense of the states who live within their means…dah….responsiblity is for fools, right? cose dell’altro mondo…. i left my home state of california in 1993. the place is beyond repair… give it to mexico and seal the border… permanently. justanoguy sell california to china to pay off the debt and make them work!! durgys ramirez the problem is the mobility of the rich. while few will leave the u.s. for tax purposes, they often will leave a state. and do. and are. you may not like such facts, but don’t let such facts change your mind. liberranter since the economic tyranny in amerika is spreading like cancer through all 50 states, i predict that those with money will soon be leaving the country once they run out of states to flee to. richard rider you may be right — eventually. but most ca departees will first move to more friendly states. later as the country deteriorates, they may try to flee the good old u.s. of a. but remember, the u.s. is the only developed country in the world that all but criminalizes anyone permanently leaving the country. all appreciated property is immediately taxed, even if not sold. we operate like a banana republic. moving to another state triggers no such penalties. yet. michaelfromtheeconomiccollapse your research was excellent richard. hopefully my little plug sent a lot of extra traffic to your outstanding article. michael undecider now, for californians who leave the state, embrace your destination. if you’re going to texas, don’t turn it into california. if you’re going to nevada, don’t turn it into california. however, i’m sure if you’re reading this article, you’re likely not part of the population that would do that. liberranter if you’re going to texas, don’t turn it into california. as long as enough real texans remain in texas, that will never be allowed to happen. adam i agree. michael gets more stupid with each post. i believe he is running out of posts. you know, he needs one the us is about to end’ post a day. talk about a negative idiots! sure some of what he posts is true, but plenty of it is inflated overly negative crap. mudslides? what a tool. i wonder what his post will be tomorrow? i can see the title now: ‘the us will collapse at any minute even though i have been wrong over and over, time and time again, seriously, i will be right this time, trust me. maybe he will just post: ‘you will die someday, so why even live?’ he is running out of overly negative things to say to keep his sheep coming to his site. again, michael is a crazy christian, out of touch, overly negative tool. liberranter thank you for helping prove that all of the negative stereotypes about the creatures that populate the most dysfunctional state in the union are 100 percent true. deborah i disagree micheal deborah michael, i am a teacher and i have serious problems with the factor of my failure. can u please do an article about how difficult our jobs as teachers have become during the downturn of society? i am a big fan. thanks in advance… liberranter you are wrong on about every level, here are a just a few of your factual errors. 1. what survey? the bureau of disgruntled bloggers? 2. yet silicon valley is here. chevron oil is here. the movie and television is here.the agriculture industry is here. yet people start companies every day. you know why? because all the people are here! 4. we are not afraid of taxes. we know our schools suck so were are willing to pay a little more for them. we especially are smart enough to know that the rich need to pay their fair share. 7. i agree this is wrong. it should be number one. 10. you didn’t live in la in the ‘60’s. you could cut the air with a knife. taxing polluters is the reason we can breath. 11. tickets are not a tax. they are a fine. they are optional. don’t wanna pay them? don’t do anything wrong. 14. call me crazy, but i want my hair-cutter and my chiropractor and yes, even my tattoo artist to be licensed. i’m funny like that. 16. how many of the tanf recipients are illegal aliens? 20. i agree with this one too. $100k a year for anyone who puts his life on the line for us is too little. it should be a least doubled. 22. talk radio’s been foaming at the mouth over this one. i don’t have enough time to go over how wrong you are. our prisons are bursting, in no small part to the deplorable lack of mental health care for those at risk. yet you would fault the pay for an md who would care for these people? i know it ‘s christmas, but have you checked to see if your heart is two sizes too small? 41. crime is down overall in los angeles. 52. yet japan, chile, italy,mexico, washington dc and new jersey have had bigger earthquakes than we have.and don’t get me started on hurricanes and blizzards. i’m too tired to go through the rest, but i suggest this. if you don’t like it, leave. yes, people are leaving. what remains are illegals, criminals, and hollywood bizzaros 2gary2 former republican: 6 reasons the gop is doomed the formerly grand old party needs to change to survive. but all we’re seeing are botox solutions. thank god the country could move forward with out the conservatives trying to pull us back to the 17th century. lmao, you are a racist democrat bad_mr_frosty the liberals and conservatives are both right. it’s the over-sized soviet government (conservatives) and the over-sized soviet corporations (liberal) that are killing the middle-class. the system will not allow people to vote for candidates that would address the problem (ron paul). bad_mr_frosty democrats are far-leftists, republicans are a center-left party. there hasn’t been conservatives in us politics for decades. apparently, they’re all “racist”. i still want to visit there. atlanta sucks ralphieboy pretty much all you state is true. we moved our business from california to texas in 2000 – best decision we ever made. no, we are not liberals who are foisting our ideas on texas– just two conservatives who were smart enough to know that california would eventually kill our business. we still maintain a home in newport beach – where 87% are registered as republicans. spend almost six months a year there – especially to escape texas summers. beach is a one minute walk from our house, and the weather is as close to perfect as is possible. no, we don’t fight traffic, and yes, we pay no california state income tax. in fact, i bet that most of our neighbors pay no california income tax either. many are folks who maintain “vacation” homes there – but were smart enough to put their primary homes our of state. of course, the morons in sacramento – like liberal morons everywhere, never understand that when the rich are taxed, the rich always find ways to legally avoid it. of course, california lost us as taxpayers when we fled the state in 2000. the state also lost our employees and that tax base as well – and they continue to lose by chasing small business away. guess i will never understand why californians continue to vote these idiots in. prior to moving to newport beach, we lived in a suburb just south of here. all of our neighbors were liberals save one or two. once our neighbors discovered we were conservative/libertarian – they had absolutely nothing to do with us, and quite frankly, some got downright nasty. then again, we are small business owners – and they are corporate or government workers who never have had to make payroll. liberranter guess i will never understand why californians continue to vote these idiots in. because most kalifornia “voters” are lazy, freeloading, economically ignorant sheepletards, like most of the rest of the nation. obviously they’re just present in greater numbers in ka than in the rest of the country. shahhe california* yet again, you insult a whole category of people’s intelligence, yet your spelling is that akin of a 2nd grader. pentachronic kalifornia is a mockery word to show communism and california as one and the same. maybe you should stop being overly pc like the rest of kalifornia. you are the problem. pc-ness allows politicians to make stupid laws and add stupid taxes on the premiss of doing the ‘right’ thing for everyone !! mh if you’re going to live here half the year, pay income taxes. all of you are complaining about the “illegals” who drain the system by not contributing tax money, etc – yet here you are, making a significant income, splitting your life between two states, and only contributing to one. dilligaf they’re taking advantage of the system, just like the illegals are. so what? is there a separate set of rules? austin my family spends all our time here but for a couple year (since we still own out ga home) d not pay the ca income tax… why? it’s ridiculously expensive. we do now unfortunately frank lucci i am los angelean, born and raised. as a kid, i saw this great state get bombarded by folks like you. yah- you wanted the beaches and the weather, and i guess you thought it was for the taking. however you came, you saw, and you destroyed whatever you could. so good-ridden to the millions who came, saw and destroyed. it would be a welcomed event for those of us natives to purge the rest of you non-natives, including the representatives you brought with you. whoever wrote this must have had a really bad experience here. the good news is it is about time! like i used to say as a kid while the planes flew overhead, “go home and don’t come back!” kathy frank, i’m guessing you are italian american from your name. i too am italian american, the great grand child of immigrants . so you may be a native of los angeles but your ancestors and mine weren’t born here my friend. they are from italy. don’t you feel that people coming here to cali legally or any place in the us to work hard should be welcomed? they can contribute to the state’s economy just as hard working, driven immigrants who are now third or fourth generation helped make this country great. when immigrants first came to the us many people spat at them because they weren’t “natives”. they said “go home!” now you want to do the same? drbuzzsaw can the rest of us, vote california out of the union??? liberranter 53. according to the u.s. census bureau, approximately 100,000 more people moved out of the state of california in 2011 than moved into it. and, having rendered their own state uninhabitable, they’re looking for new places to destroy by polluting neighboring states with nanny-state nonsense and high-handed arrogance. we’re flooded with kalifornia refugees here in se arizona and i do my part to make them feel as unwelcome as possible. liberranter another kalifornia krazy in denial. sorry, pal, but it doesn’t wash. go bark your delusions up some other tree. pcmustgo one reason- they let in too many mexicans who are illegal, don’t earn much, if they work at all, don’t value education, are prone to gangs and theft and corruption, have too many children out of wedlock , born into poverty , at way too young an age,e tc. main reason- shifted from a majority white place to a majority brown, low iq kind of place. third world population creates third world conditions. no offense to mexicans, but it’s the truth. mexicans and their behavior/genetics are why mexico is mexico. terry smith california is the best state in the union!!!! people who hate it, can’t afford it!!! and thats ok, move your broke @ss to the trailer trash crappy midwest, or the smelly trailer trash rustbelt! if your not pulling in over a $100k annually .lol,lol,lol lily i hear ya. brother. right on. i love ca mark marky its time to rotate the tires on your mama’s single wide! mark your not, lmao lynn i live in san diego, where almost year round i am able to take in a beautiful walk. neighbors are friendly. there’s a sense of community, and we all watch out for each other. crime in san diego is way down from the ’80s and ’90s, i don’t live in a planned urban development, but in the heart of the city. i love the diversity, the languages, the people. traffic is heavy, but at least it moves, and most drivers i find are polite. the state is still beautiful… our city, state and national parks are gems. sure, we have our problems, but californians are feisty and independent. i’m sure michael could write the same article on any of the other 49 states and list their problems. i for one love the uniqueness of ca. and you haven’t lived until you’ve tried a fish taco. richard rider bad as our ca taxes are, that’s just one factor. we are extremely anti-business, have sky-high utility costs (not even counting ab32 increases) and are now rated the “worst judicial hellhole” in the nation. aside from the weather (which is great along the coastal zone), there is every reason to leave this state — especially if one is engaged in commerce. california? it’s politics, fruit cakes, liberals, entitlement infested population, taxes, and rules! doesn’t even rate a comment! dominik yes all of this is true, but don’t forget about the successful companies here. california is the most unique state in the union. from the food to the fashion. of course the most beautiful state (in my opinion) gets stuck with all the insane politicians and way to many regulations and…well everything stated above. california still does have the largest textile factory that makes clothes in america by american workers and nothing is shipped from other countries to american apparel inc. which is the last great american clothing company. kurt cobain i like how someone else other than me is identifying the illegals by what they are; mexicans. or is the term mexicans too politically incorrect? sandra bell many are central and south american too. w dawes actually there is a lot of illegal chinese in california too danny_sunset and a lot of illegal israelis and other middle easterners. nimrod born and raised in socal during the golden period (1960-1980’s) left in 1988, returned in 1994-2002, then left for good. low crime, nice people, great place to live, go to school, safe to walk around back then….but since early-mid 1990’s this is all gone. my old high school turned into a prison camp, my old city into a little tijuana, the traffic is bad 24-7, high costs for everything! moved to the southeast: low crime, low cost of living, 10 minutes to work, low/no traffic, morals and values are taught and practiced. i went out for an interview in ca lately, even norcal looks like tijuana now. the freeways were littered with trash, the beach cities were unkept, people were not friendly, businesses were run down. i told them don’t bother making me an offer as i was not interested in living in the state. so not only is ca losing businesses, they are now becoming uncompetitive for the best employees. because of the squalor, it will get much worse, maybe never get better. we need to flush the system clean, stop attracting freeloaders and get on with life without being dragged down. there is no reason that we need to provide any free lunches and bring in more legal or illegals until we find jobs for the 25million people that are out of work. lou california is overpopulated, period….. due mostly to foreigners, especially mexicans and koreans here illegally. they trashed their own countries and are now doing the same in california david salter you forgot one very important fact, and one that the rest of the world is looking at with bemusement; california had the chance recently, with prop 37, to catch up with europe (i live in uk) and enforce labelling of gmo foods. and they blew it! why on earth would you not want to know what is in the food you eat? this shows complacent trust in a government that continues to screw you over at every opportunity. and a complete failing to notice the corruption between big business, government and the media. brian johann schuler california sucks the list is endless also the weather even along the coast its either really hot really cold super windy really dry or really wet the weather is terrible and boring its all extremes its too dry and it does not snow in la i cant wait to leave jimi if it wasn’t for the fiscally socialist welfarism i’d move to california in a heartbeat. bogmire sure its pretty, but its full of self-righteous fools who have shown how poorly they run a government, i want out, as soon as i am out of college, im out of cali. shahhe no seriously, we want you gone. girlswagger notice how this is the only site that states how horrible cali is. lmfao openeye there is more.then nust mexicans, if that someone else wasnt blind, there are, chinese, russians, and many different race coming here, also from way down south past mexico. unless your a reneck “ahmercin”.then you should understand that there is alot more people who come.here illegaly. angel hey im not mexican but not all mexicans are undocumnted as u think…. anon i don’t care if they are or not. it’s terrible that they come in to help ruin (note the help) the country. we don’t need anymore migrant workers that dodge taxes while having the state spend thousands on them. i say this as an unfortunate hypocrite who has one clean the house every friday. steven p chiolan at least you’re honest. tom don’t forget about all the indians and chinese that come to our universities and then stay in our country and take the top paying jobs. pentachronic the educated people are not an issue. they pay large amounts of taxes as they are typically high-end workers who have good qualifications. the problem is that the state puts nothing back into education. they reap what they sew. bad government is the key issue. the-truth-hurters you sound like just another ignorant white republican spewing hate without knowing any real facts. first of all, you’re an immigrant in this country too because you stole it from the native americans don’t forget that redneck joe. second, your country was built by immigrants in the first place like the chinese who came here and built the railroads and ifrastructure, and the indians are the only reason you even have a silicon valley at all. third, no one is stealing your jobs… you are losing them because these people are more qualified, smarter, and work harder than fat/racist/ignorant/poorly educated white hick americans. you can’t blame an indian or chinese for taking your jobs when they study and work hard all day long while you’re out drinking beer and eating burgers, and riding around in your pickup truck saying “america f**k yeah!” while demanding higher salaries for doing less work and more vacation time. what has happened is that the world today is a lot more interconnected with the advent of social media, the internet, gloablization, and many of the new technologies… this makes it easier for people from all over the world to migrate where they will have a better life just like you honky americans did when you came from the uk to america. the only difference is that for years you have been saying america is the best everything and now you can’t just simply say that anymore; now you actually have to back it up and all you uneducated republican americans are finding out you’re actually not the best at anything and that most of the world is quite smarter and harder working than you are and you simply can’t deal with it so you blame the immigrants, eventhough you yourself are immigrants in the first place. the truth is that many of the immigrants that come here have had much worse circumstances and a far harder life which has taught them a good work ethic. we as americans have been spoiled by our luxuries and now when these people that have a better work ethic than us come here we find it hard to compete and all we do is bitch and moan. if you want your jobs back then work harder and learn to compete with those that are better qualified and you will get them back. lastly, the people that are hiring the the immigrants who are better qualified and that work for less are the white people anyway, so it’s actually your own kind whos selling you out. glorp wow the-truth-hurters appears to be a hate mongering ignorant liberal…. so sad you call someone ignorant and hateful but ignore your own hate you spew from your poisoned mind… ben liberals like the truth hunters are destroying this country. illegal immigrants are taken food off legal americans plates . these corrupt politicians are destroying are legal system. no legal citizen that own an real property is safe stand up dont support this don’t buy into this! if u don’t feed it it can’t survive the-truth-hurters yeah, anyone who has actual knowledge and some coherent logic of whats really going on in the us; and who doesn’t just find some one to point their fingers at is a “liberal.” what a well put together argument you made, that’s exactly why you’re kind is become obsolete. you’re just another entitled white american conservative, who cant open their eyes and adapt to change… by the way i’m not a liberal either, so try again. the greedy and immoral investment banks/corporations/corrupt politicians (conservative & liberal alike) are what has ruined this country, not immigration. if you have any education you’d understand the complexity behind whats going on behind the scenes. it’s wealthy white ceo’s and investment bankers who control washington, the fdr, our policies and politicians; and they are the ones who are selling your own kind out. the truth is you’re misinformed and uneducated on how your government really works, and you are being brainwashed by your false american patriotism; which is exactly what the powers that be are depending on to control and manipulate you. i have nothing against you personally, and you don’t have to agree with me and you’re entitled to your own opinion… but come on, how can an immigrant who has no establishment/resources in a new country affect or control anything… that’s ludicrous and things are not so black and white as you make them out to be. corporate white america and investment banks are the cause of all this. wake up! the vile maxim by adam smith is what has ruined our country, not a handful of immigrants. pedro a lopez i like the way you think. i am not illegal but i am from central, born an rase and the ignorance in this great country is sad. charles diemont they come here for work, and then send all the money back south. the-truth-hurters lol! no they don’t. do you have any empirical data to prove your ignorant claim? any statistics to show? by the way, are you even aware that your avatar is an afghan fighter holding an ak47; which ironic since you’re against foreigners. no personal offense intended, but it seems that you’re not very bright or observant. and so what if immigrants send money back home to help their families? i’m a us born american and i would too if i was in the same situation. nothing comes before family, definitely not patriotism to a country that’s selling out its own citizens for corporate greed. if you were struggling in your home land and could have a better life in another country, don’t tell me that you wouldn’t migrate to where you could have a better life and do whats best your family… after all, that’s what america’s founders did in the first place when they founded this country. this land was the native americans land, and everyone else is an immigrant here! let’s see you prove that wrong… you have no right to say who can be here and who can’t because this is not your country to do so! furthermore, you’re so concerned about immigrants sending what little money they make back home, yet your “american” corporations and investment banks are evading taxes and siphoning billions of dollars offshore… yet that’s fine! what an immigrant makes has no affect on the economy, however dirty companies like apple and google have enough money to end poverty and hunger worldwide (look it up -its a fact) and yet they don’t put anything back into our economy and that’s the real reason behind our crumbling economy. your lack of education is scary especially when considering a lot of “patriotic” americans like you are so uneducated and full of hate; and then they go and vote being completely misinformed. please open a book and read about how our economy works and what the vile maxim is. understand what’s going on behind the scenes and how the privately owned fdr manipulates currency and inflation. learn about how corporate and special interest lobbyists have demolished the ideals that this country was founded on, and you’ll start to see that immigrants are nothing but a scapegoat and that you are being brainwashed and led astray by your gov. the population of this country is so dumb that a hateful fear monger like trump may actually win the election! why, because this is a nation of uneducated morons who have no clue about how their country really works. southpark totally nailed it with their “dey toook r jobs!” pull your head out of the sand and learn the truth! i love my country, but i hate the people in charge and the rampant ignorance among the general population. molon_labe do you have any empirical data to prove your ignorant claim that i’m uneducated? and speaking of ignorant, it’s a red dawn avatar dumbass lol get back to your bull prepping kayaker it’s the corporations and the wealthy that do the tax dodging. wake up!!!! the-truth-hurters yes i agree 100%. the greedy and immoral obscenely wealthy individuals/corporations/investment banks are the real problem. you are one of the few enlightened ones out there and that gives me hope that others will catch up and see also see the truth. pedro a lopez wow help ruin the country. you are so stupid but whatever makes you happy at night. molon_labe then they are american. not mexican. and you saying other wise is why we have the problems we do with immigration from mexico. john republicans californiarules california is the greatest place to live and work. economy was and is the largest in the u.s., and your opinions are not shared. jealousy and unhappiness is comes through your ariticle. we love california. alexbella in the words of my science teacher, “i rathef be in an 8.5 earthquake than a stage 1 tornado”. californias the best, 20 minutes from everything! i can snowboard and go to the beach in one day! each weekend i have 10 amusment parks to choose from, the beach, venice, concerts, snowboarding, ect! maybe it costs more to live here but i moved away for a year, and never again will i live anywhere other than california. frog get a life or get off of the computer frog stop picking on other states where all a nation and that’s coming from a 13 year old ya’ll just got served nockout99 i agree with frog oklahoma yes..it’s a canary…like china, india and africa “perfect example[s] of what happens when you continually add more and more people”…to the planet. vic all people talk about is the weather. i have lived in mexifornia for 42 years and the people who run this state have killed it. what’s sad is that the unions have taken control and these sheeple keep believing their lies so they keep voting for bull crap. pelosi, boxer, feinstein, moon-beam brown, newsom, waters, these are some of the biggest morons to ever hold office. they even shut down our farm lands to save a freaken fish. stupid people and i can’t wait to leave…. b meh, the author doesn’t live here. more than half of that rant is opinion, another 45% doesn’t make sense/is not substantiated. plenty of work, the state govt isn’t broke (in fact we now have a surplus), people here are still alive, lots of big business still here (intel, apple, google, levi’s, tesla, hollywood, napa valley, thd entire central cali agricultural business, and so on…). we still have two world class cities, so much natural beauty that songs, movies, poetry, have been created about it, people travel from the other side of the earth to see it, and residents get to see it daily. you can travel thru 5 climates in less than 3 hours. nothing’s free bitch. if u like nice things ya gotta pay for ’em. california is one of the largest states, is the most populous, and by far the best looking – that’s gotta be maintained… if ur a cheap-ass, move to fugly-ass texass or some other midwestern/southern donkey-#%€er state where taxes are cheap but half the state is on welfare and in poverty and “edumacation” is not a priority according to the state representatives… so, californians aren’t leaving in “droves” (so stupid). we are still here in ca enjoying life and laughing at the fools who are jealous and therefore feel the need to knock this awesome and crazy, delicious and beautiful, one-of-a-kind place. erin right on baby! you tell ‘em! austin i moved to california 3 years ago this month, my sophomore year of highschool. i love it here and am not leaving for any reason other than travel when i can afford to. i have now graduated highschool and i’m attending college in a quaint costal city. the first 15 years of my life was spent in a suburb of atlanta and it is much better here imo. i live on the border of encinitas and south carlsbad (la costa) and use the beach as a daily getaway. while the tourism gets annoying its wonderful meeting so many people everyday. there are very few cops away from the freeway i drive at least 30 minutes a day and usually see one cop but there is very very little crime in this area of san diego county. i know big cities can be fun if you’re visiting but they are the majority of reasons you have listed to not live here. i definitely felt more of a sense of community where i’m from in georgia but once you make friends out here and fall in love with the ocean and bays/activities you can do around them you realize it’s a different kinda love. & where i live there are very few mexicans. just find the right area if you wanna live here (preferably on the coast not in a major city) and you may love it like me. i’m 18 and hope to live past 50 stayin in this beautiful state. most importantly if you want to get away from people there are canyons even in the coastal cities with trails all over the place and there’s few to none people and they’re usually gorgeous. checkout encinitas if you want to get away from big city lifestyle. later everyone! fr33th1nk3r the biggest thing i cannot stand since moving here from pennsylvania 10 years ago– is the overwhelming conformity and materialism here. everybody in california seems to listen to the same terrible mainstream music, the same crappy trendy movies and tv reality shows, and they all spend more time talking about their ipads and mobile devices than worrying about education or the nation as a whole.– everything here, from the pizza to the beaches, is overhyped and made out to be the best thing to happen since sugarless gum– but in reality, you will get the cheapened, watered down, overmarketed and overpriced california version.– everything is overregulated. you can’t even enjoy a beer on the beach without getting a citation. you can’t even change a doorknob in your house without some local government code enforcement type trying to tack on fees and fines for your troubles.– the graduation rate for public schools in california is abyssmal. rai hey, could you do me a favor and link reliable sources and stuff that actually backs up your claims more often? because when i see breitbart and articles that don’t really prove your point upon closer inspection i tend to think you’re a liar. the carbon tax article you linked had “could” in the title, meaning it doesn’t prove it’s even happening in the first place. then again, when i look at this blog title you’re probably just as reliable as breitbart. anonymous i am a fifth generation northern californian and all i have to say is that some of these issues can happen anywhere. for example, you can’t prevent earthquakes, mudslides, or wildfires and its not like we want them to happen, we just can’t control them. i’m not trying to rag on anyone, so please keep the negative comments out of this. i do agree that at this point in time our government and school systems are screwed up and that illegal immigrants are also screwing up our state’s balance, but everyone just focuses on ca with immigrants… what about arizona, new mexico, and texas? while i’m at it, the traffic is only bad in southern ca (i know this because i’ve lived in the bay area my entire life, never moved never wanted to) and this whole thing is blown out of proportion. by the way, i know about that city that banned smoking and it was for the good of the people, smoking causes lung cancer and cigs have such harmful things in them that they should be banned all over the country. i also know that oakland is one of the worst cities in ca and that its also one of the most dangerous cities, too, but that doesn’t mean that all of ca is dangerous. also, even though it doesn’t state it here, keep your stereotypes to yourself! californians aren’t blonde moron surfers with nose jobs and botox, we are actual people, not the fake characters on tv shows. pysco i forwarded the article to boxer, brown and feinstein, and told them have a nice day. i urge everyone to do the same. vaggieburger i l❤ve california! i have lived in the sf bay area all my life, born & raised! (3rd generation san franciscan 😉 i dont agree w/what our government is doing, nor do i feel good about it but i love ca w/all my heart! west siii-eeed! lol lol jelous much? now name the great things about cali ahmed illegals? the whole country is illegal, so stop being a republican about it. “this country was founded by a group of slave owners who wanted to be. am i right? a group of slave owners who wanted to be free! so they killed a lot of white english people in order to continue owning their black african people, so they could wipe out the rest of the red indian people, in order to move west and steal the rest of the land from the brown mexican people, giving them a place to take off and drop their nuclear weapons on the yellow japanese people.” carlin, g. commonsense thank you for posting a/b a subject almost over 200 years old, as if it pertains anyway what so ever to the present decline of california… anon immigrants built this country but that does not mean they can tear it down. get off your historically correct high horse and see what they are doing now. molon_labe funny how they always bring up we’re a nation of immigrants. yes, of course we are. but look at the difference the two brought to the table. built some of the largest cities in the world. these immigrants from south of our border, well, one just go to a once thriving city to see the effect they have. utter filth and destruction. educated_person_101 because geroge carlin is the final word on perfect political harmony. you are influenced by the wrong people. comedians’ opinions on politics are worthless. molon_labe everyone in this room is now dumber from having read that. i award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul. you must have learned that in a california school. during white privilege class. ma i am a native to california, and i still live here. i do not plan to leave or move any where else any time soon mainly because i love this state. there is so much to do. i would hate living in, for example, georgia. not only is there nothing to do there, but there are racist people, and well i would not want to deal with that considering that i’m not white. it is more excepting here. mainly in southern california, because there is everyone. i would hate to be surrounded just be one race. plus, weather is unbeatable compared to other states. it does get hot, and cold, but not nearly as much compared to other states. i love california (mostly southern) and i am not leaving. blue blooded californian wow so biased its funny. no state is perfect, that being said this person failed to talk about some other things. california accounts for 15% of the u.s gdp, this state alone makes more then canada, or russia. if california was a country it would be the eight largest economy in the world. texas as everyone seem to be talking about, let me say some things about that. highest un-insured rate, and one of the highest poverty rate, no state minim wage which means that they follow the fed min wage, which is $7.25 (san francisco min wage $10.75) oh and lets not forget how much federal aid texas has and still keep getting. where as for california, who does have problem (i admit that) is giving more back to the govt then its taking in. based on several economist california is on track for a surplus in 2014. california has movies, tech, agriculture, its own cuisine i can go on and on. texas and every other conservative states takes more then its gives out. which really makes one to rethink, the premise about takers and givers does it!! so stop your bitching because everyone who has every come to california would love to move here, they just can’t afforded it. if you don’t like it, leave. citizenx i’m still waiting for the rest of the people that don’t like california to move out of the state. please. anonymous not sure how everyone in the comments can’t see what how blatantly ignorant and completely absurd this article is… for example “32. political correctness is totally out of control in california”. great use of evidence there, not biased at all! i can acknowledge that the economy in california is suffering, but at least educate yourself on what’s really going on before you mindlessly bash all the “liberal douchebags”. bob dole not just liberals, we have plenty of douchbag republicans, in fact most of our states problems were caused by republicans and their corporate interests, not liberals. anon and yet our state has been run by liberals for the last couple of decades, at least. now, we have a democrat super majority in the state… re-read the list and see what they have done to drive businesses out of the state. most of that was because of the liberals. the cities with the most liberal policies (in california) are the most expensive and crime-ridden places to live in. also, some of the most successful businesses in california tend to be democrat-leaning. www dot goodguide dot com slash contributions. sinjonsmith if its so bad, then why to real estate values continue to go through the roof? real estate is like any other market or commodity. people pay high prices for highly desired goods. people pay high prices for california real estate because its a desirable place to live and although it has a lot of problems, i can name 10 other states with worse problems including all the rust belt states (iowa, wisconsin, mich, indiana, ohio, illinois) where there is an exodus of people to get away from failing infrastructure, corruption and rising taxes to pay for it all..not to mention bad weather..and extremely poor southern states that have no economy..mississippi, alabama, south carolina and florida where the education system is worse than california…as well as some states with huge budget problems out east like jersey…i’ll take california any day over any of these other states..california’s economy alone is the 12th largest in the world and the us would take a huge hit if it didn’t exist..i don’t live in ca, but imo if you want to start a page on how much a state sux, start elsewhere…oh another thing about everyone crying about illegals…like cali is the only place where that happens…its the only place where people come over the border…its a national issue idiots..and we have plenty in chicago…i own real estate and without them, id have to pay some other white fat dude 5 times as much to work half as hard and do 1/10 as quality of work who’s probably in a union…oh which this page ironically hates because probably because unions are left leaning… james every time the state legislature de-funds or disapproves a highway/bridge/public university repair project on the annual budget, people pass a $1b bond ballot measure during the next election to get the state into more debt and re-fund that particular effort. voters in ca fail to realize that a new university center or highway overpass is nice, but somebody has to pay for it by raising state debt (often paid for with new taxes). i used to live there, and every election had millions of new bonds to be raised for somebody’s pet project on the ballot. my rule when voting was 99% of the time “no” if it required a new municipal bond to be raised, especially if it was an attempt to circumvent the regular budget process in sacramento. james ca is also one of the few states where a $100k income may not be enough to buy real estate. a down-payment on a ca home can pay the loan in full for an average home in many other states. people in high cost living areas (la, sf, sd, etc…) take out huge mortgages and cram 10 people in a small home to pay their mortgage every month. it’s no coincidence that many of the homes shown being flipped on hgtv are located in ca. unless you’re rich, bought a home 25 years ago, or inherited property from a relative, or resort to shady funding methods (i.e. share mortgage payment with 6 people, take out multiple loans, etc…) it’s tough to buy real estate in ca. fornian’ ok first of all california is the best state of all. second you are unworthy. bynx110 1. it’s california not kalifornia. 2. do you know how ignorant and prejudice you sound? it’s disgusting really. yes our state has major problems but we are all u.s citizens. treat others as you wish to be treated. did it ever cross your small mind that maybe people from california treated you poorly because of the way you decided to treat them? treat people with respect, we all come from different places and different walks of life. do you agree with the holocaust, slave trade, native american treatment, and all the other major in tolerances in history? think before you write….because you are clearly defining how not to be a decent human being. emeraldstar i’ve lived in southern cali all my life. after graduating college and going on to graduate school i decided it was time to leave. i moved to mi six months ago! yes detroit is bad, but it’s like that one city is pulling the entire states reputation down. no matter how bad detroit is, the rest of the state is so much better than anywhere i’ve been in southern cali. yes, i miss the diversity of people but here are some reasons a person my age would leave. the u’s in cali can take up to six months to let you know if you’ve even been accepted. wmu let me know in less than two weeks. the cost of tuition and books are ridiculous when compared to the type of education you will be receiving (a bad one). about 75% of students care about taking their education seriously and the rest are there for the financial aid. in socal it can take you months if not years (depending on what you do) to find a job, i found a job in less than a week in mi. the weather in amazing in ca and i miss the different cultures and their awesome food, but the pace is too fast, too many people are stressed out and are either jaded or jerks (not all, but there is a overhanging stress level you can’t really escape) when your worried about being laid off or making ends meat no wonder… also, the crime! theft is a huge issue in socal. be it car, private property, or downright armed robbery. gangs are a major problem in the l.a. area especially. taxes are ridiculous and because larger companies know jobs are slim pickings they use it as an excuse to treat you like garbage. what are you going to do? quit? too bad you have kids to feed. welcome to cali, the suck it up things aren’t getting any better soon state. don’t get me wrong, if it wasn’t for the people and the politics cali is my home and i love it in a weird “that’s my ugly baby” kind of way lol. beautiful beaches, amazing deserts and mountains. i miss it sometimes. then i read about a family that was murdered two miles from the high school i went to and nope! glad i left. best place to visit, but once you get past the fascination with this glamorous hollywood lifestyle you’ll realize that it’s all a lie. hollywood and l.a. are full of hobo’s and the whole city smells like urine and garbage. except that small complex in little tokyo, then it smells like amazing asian food lol! get the golden state idea out of your head, that golds been tarnished for years : shahhe oh good god. i’m fairly certain your what’s causing the poor education rating in whatever part of california your living in. please leave this wonderful state and the education rating will probably rise in literacy at least by tenfold. stassia please stay there and everyone will be happy. shahhe it is spelled with a c. and one wonders why arizona scores lower than the rest on literacy. shahhe you keep saying that yet you’ve yet to leave. i don’t think you realize that your wanted gone, please, feel free to go to oklahoma or utah, or even texas or florida. it matters not! all that matters is that you are to leave, as you claim you wish to, and as you are deeply wanted to by those in california before people like you came here hoping for free everything, then shocked when it turned out that the presence of so many like you tarnished it. so hopefully, with you gone, and staying gone this time, california will become fully back to the days of yore. so please, leave and don’t come back once that happens. not ever. sorry. davis rivas the best thing about california is all the freebies you can get, welfare, food-stamp, medicaid, free lunches, housing, etc.. even prisoners in california live better than middle classes in other countries. the tax payers in ca are so generous. thanks guys. john bottom line–those that can’t afford the california luxuries move to lesser states than bash california, cause they could not make it or be happy. i would never leave california. enjoy the snow, rain and cold. i will not! have fun with all that. we have the best weed, the best weather and the hottest women. bottom line–there is always a story behind the story when someone bashes california. some crazy people move from california to oregon and convince themselves that 290 days of rain a year is better, give me a break! lol @ the true californians like me that laugh at you all. have fun in your other state and remember when you are complaining about the cold or snow or grey sky, i’m smiling with my shirt off smoking weed laughing at you fools. melissa i was born in san diego 45 years ago and have never left. oh, i wish you would get the word out so more people would leave california, and less people would come here. then i could have less crowds, more parking, more room at the beach. me and the millions of mexicans will stay here in san diego, we get along fine. everyone who doesn’t like it, please go awa . it’s great because whenever i visit anywhere else i always notice: the weather really sucks and everything is so cheap! no sales tax? no state income tax? i am always blown away by states like this. that makes my dollar go a lot farther when i travel so fine by me. orisha the drought is caused by the hight priest of the world in solidarity against gov. brown and all the states unions in solidarity against awogbade. he is a shaman from sacramento california who created a crime prevention youth program that ex. gov. choose as his personal legacy program. multiple murder attempts were made on this innocent high priest and his father was murdered on jan.5th 2013. the high pressure system blocking rain in pacific ocean are the ancestors spirits in solidarity against the injustice of gov. brown and police/corrections union and the denial of civil rights to awogbade over last 8 year period. this is only the start to what the myans forecast. since 12-12-12. the date union members in californias department of justice tracked awogbade and hitmen inserted aids blood into him. no justice no water! it’s only starting in california. without a thorough fbi investigation into yeshua awogbade court case in sacramento…the forces of nature will wipe americas slate clean. miaeka thanks, as an european this post convinced me that california is definitely less retarded than rest of america. i’m looking forward to supporting their economy by visiting them some day. i love the stable and civilized societies we europeans have managed to create through high taxation. i hope california will reach the same level of civilization some day. bob dole you can keep it, we prefer liberty and freedom, and yes we will invade you no questions asked if you threaten that. shango!!! yeshua awogbade is my son. ive had full custody 4 years because shoshana robertson in a active alcoholic and meth addict. according to shoshana she was molested by her first cousin mayor kevin johnson since age 12. after her july 2nd suicide attempt she told the mayor, my son is his and if she dont get custody back and 2 million dollars she woukd expose him. the police union got behind there mayor and multiple attempts have been made on my life. after the first attempt on my life i called upon the forces of nature for protection and punishment to those responsible. last year was the worst drought on record because of police union actions and violation of my civil rights for 8 years. without a real fbi investigation the nations weather will be the worst. jack the state stinks for real…its a commie-liberal pisshole. callie honestly california lifestyle is the best in the country. no where else will ever compare. as someone who has traveled and lived in other places, i can honestly testify that there’s no better place to spend this precious life in. it’s a beautiful place with beautiful souls. not california the best thing i ever did was to move my family and company out of california. i tried for years to sell my company, few were interested but none would buy it as long as it remained in california, and to be honest, selling it in california would has set us back two careers. found out by moving to nevada we saved all the tax money california would have robbed from us. after a year in nevada company was sold. we no longer live in nevada but i will say we did leave nevada a better place, and nevada made us better people, nevada gave use back the humanity california stole at every chance it could take. california has the worst schools, the worst people the worst cops, the worst opportunity, brought on by the worst government, the worst everything you could image, it just plain sucks. i went to court one time my attorney had everything laid out and the judge said i don’t recognize that law, the attorney said here is a brief, judge said i don’t recognize that law. attorney said here is the law book already marked all you need to do is read it, judge said,,, you got it. he didn’t recognize the law. to the judge my attorney said, you have already decided haven’t you, the judge smiled, to make it short we won on appeal, the money held by the state was returned i moved it into nevada, my company and my family, the guy that bought my company divested all the california holdings, big loss to the people of the state. i have a buddy that is doing the same thing, pulling his company out of california and going to headquarters it in nevada then divest all california holdings at a loss of another 900 jobs to the state. when you look up the word looser, california is on the top of the list. i should say i was born and raised in california, what i used to think was the best place on earth, santa clara, then as we did better dad moved us to los altos hills. i went for a visit to northern california to see some friends, i bought a truck that ran on propane with a big tank, i didn’t have to spend a dime on anything in that state. i hate that state so much i will never spend a dime there. julia dunkee iii the disney hall complex on that picture is usually under sold for concerts. the bar is lame, the restaurant prentious and overpriced, and it has all the chic of an airplane hanger. it has good acoustics and some great people come through but it is like mostly closed up during week. poor mex student work the usher roles and the mostly older elite types aren’t interesting and dress like 1800’s. it has these sheriff deputies guarding i guess the 1% and they always look at me with why am i here faces. sad place. homeless vets live underneath bridge it sits on. that says it all. julia dunkee iii hollywood is supported by the economic engine of nail salons, tattoo parlors, weed shops, and hooker wear type stores. at night it has some blade runner type nightclubs that are from the low level to hollywood crowds, but unlike other cities the paps can do whatever so it’s always crazy that way. tourists keep coming though it is grimy, dirty and no stars except on premieres which are hugely policed and controlled. all hollywood blvd. has hidden cams that are watched from a special station. the la is considered a “gateway” city and employs the trapwire surveillance system. plus it is usung drones now to like arizona. julia dunkee iii it is not well understood by most but the hollywood smarter money has left la or is trying to. it is more than taxes. many people come in for the media industry but there is a sizable exodus judging by home listings in any real estate listing service. the la times is total bs propaganda that even locals call out all the time. it is strange because a lot of the moneyed are exiting fast. and it gives me creeps cause these people already can avoid most things. i think some event is scheduled here. i think others are aware of that too. stephanie s i moved to the midwest a year ago from l.a. and just went back for a visit. yes, it’s nice and pretty and the weather is great. cool place to visit, i don’t want to live there again. crime, “diversity”, materialism, frantic pace, traffic…no thanks. a short visit is pleasant but living there was becoming a nightmare. calilove i’ve lived in ca most of my life and i have to say i have never seen a mexican beggar asking for money or food or anything. selling oranges, flowers, etc by the freeway? absolutely! i just had to point out observation after reading all of these racist comments. if you’re not a ca resident, you are reading some random stats that do not necessarily reflect the economic status of my neighborhood. also, ca is a “horrible” state because of wildfires and earthquakes?! get real! i haven’t witnessed any awful blizzards, huge hail storms or tornados destroying huge trailer parks in ca. oh wait! not many trailers here, our homes are constructed to withstand earthquakes & are built on a foundation! christian so much hate against the mexicans, have you ever been in a migration office? there’s many asian people middle eastern, also european people, so take your comment back and insert it inside your butt hole. molon_labe i don’t see asian, arab or european migrants leaving ghettos of once great cities in their wake. monsatan never been across the pond, i take it? bgenie you missed the russian and ukrainian immigrants here in n.ca. they are productive, going to college, taking esl classes, working and opening stores. the mexicans come here, expect us to learn their language, live off welfare, spray-paint graffiti, rob stores/banks, and deal drugs. i worked in an er; a mexican family on welfare brought in a 10y/o girl who was ‘feeling sick’. turns out she was pregnant… by her uncle, and they were happy because they were purposely breeding her for more welfare money. mexicans are parasites, we need to close the border. mike mccormack ewww gross. uncle daddy. sandra bell did you report this situation to child abuse authorities? the girl should have been legally and permanently removed from the home and the rest of the family deported as criminals with no chance of future citizenship. dw i hope to hell you sterilized her christian nope, cali is very nice, your life sucks haha michael hansson why do californians keep voting on these politician that is turning their beautiful state into a hellhole? funruffian the physical geography of california is vast and beautiful. the terrain and natural landscapes are magnificent. unfortunately, it has too many crappy people and crappy leaders. rogersan you forgot the epic drought going on right now… allfab a reason why it is one of the best: the writer of this article doesn’t live here. taylor this articles retarded. its repeats the sames stuff over and over again. we have higher wages anyhow to hiving higher taxes makes sense, derrr. sdreal wow, i might as well just leave the ca after reading this. haha. – i love living in southern ca and i have a well paying job selling software to high tech industries. i can travel anywhere in the west, but i mostly choose to stay in ca because that is where most of the money is… and who wants to go anywhere else unless absolutely necessary? certainly, texas is always lowest on my list of places to visit. outside of austin, it’s a cultural vacuum and in the summer it’s hotter than an oven. plus, outside of oil, the industries aren’t nearly as robust and dynamic as those in ca. – don’t you think it’s interesting that some of the biggest and most innovative companies on the planet, like apple and google, are based in california? guest as all those people leave, the nutty liberals remain behind and their power grows. the growing number of poor will go along with whatever they say so long as the benefits keep coming and increasing. eventually the state is going to bust and then they’ll howl for dc to bail them out, and dc probably will. anon arizona especially is awful. you want to talk about a piece of trash, it’s phoenix burning rubber smell and angry, flaring inferno environment in july. izzycafe we have a democratic super majority and they are driving our great state into the likes of detroit city.. only it will be the whole state. the thinking is tax and put fees and regulations on everything.. they need, more and more and more, they think it will produce more revenue to help with the unsustainable retirement and pensions of government worker. the thing is, that never ever works.. and like a horrible cancer it kills all things that are good. molon_labe been there. beautiful state, nice people up north, but the cities, i wouldn’t go near there if you paid me 7 figures. i was so disgusted i will literally cheer if an earthquake breaks it off into the ocean. i’ll stick to the lone star state and the south where the people have manners. chin sims no, new jersey is the worst. way f__king worse. christopher umsted dont even need to read this to say that california life sucks only reason y i did cuz of a hw assignment even though me and my fellow classmates are living it smeagel4t odd how housing prices just keep rising, and rising, and rising… which is a very clear free market indication of demand. lee i can create a list about every state in the union and tell you why it’s the worst state….it’s not hard to do. to me it just looks like this website is about fear. it promotes the idea that the world economy it’s going to collaps and so you need to buy good and silver. sugarsail1 born and raised in california…it sucks for all the reasons mentioned above. too many socialist politically correct fascist enviro-whack jobs from the bay area running the show and the anti-business regulation has killed the middle class and the job market. the only people that do well here is people on some kind of government subsidized business, like healthcare, welfare, or green boondoggles or limousine liberals in hollywood with more money than brains. sooner or later they will run out of other people’s money and they will have to build a wall to keep californians from escaping to mexico. the only reason to live here is the weather and the weed and even the weather sucks in the north (the weed doesn’t). molon_labe californians. since your voted for it, please keep yourself confined within it’s borders. it’s only right to make you deal with the issues you brought upon yourselves. moving to a different place and dragging that down too isn’t fair to people whovote with common sense. inverse137 there are some good points in this article and a lot of stupid personal opinions. you are better off sticking with facts than conjecture. conjecture makes you look stupid and weak. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 48 and 51 are just whining without facts. numbers. you cannot dispute hard numbers. i would have listed it like: the average commute time in california is xx and the national average is yy. what is listed in those instances is just filling space. new york boy everyone dissing california sounds like a bunch of bitches! and would lay out your incredible boring lives. kayaker what a biased piece of propaganda. ca is way ahead of the rest of the nation in addressing climate change, re-localizing of food growing, promoting solar, etc., etc., etc. it has lots of problems, but at least is doing things a lot smarter than the vast majority of the u.s. which is going backwards. tyler are these statistics even real? some seem a little bias. however i am california native, los angeles to be exact and will all of the problems that we do have going on, i love my state! when i travel people are amused and want to be surrounded by beaches and celebs. many others states hate and i can’t relate. vacationing to other states is wonderful however, i will never ever move out of california. guest have you californians ever thought about independence? you are an economic global power house on your own! (the state has the 8th largest economy on the planet even larger than india and nearly as large as russia!!!) cgoofies it is very competitive, with people i don’t believe should be holding these jobs i went to school for. then they can’t leave because they are like sardines usually commuting and not spending quality time working. beautiful i agree, needs to be demolished and rebuilt, possibly. jackass you can say that about any politician, not all dems are bad, not all reps are bad. dw all dems are bad in california, because there is no competition for them and they know they will be re-elected no matter what as long as they hold out that welfare check and keep on letting in illegals. working class families are in the minority now, so the welfare and public assistance crowd are in charge of who gets elected. in other words, the inmates have taken charge of the mental institute. tangowhitetrash #54 though. why is it so hard to understand, we don’t want you! i’m sure you’re all wonderful people, but bringing the same ideologies which caused the problems you’re now running from with you will only ruin us too. please, solve your problems, we’ve got our own things to worry about. thor according to californians, cupernicus was wrong. all of the planets ,moons, stars, etc. do not revolve around the sun…. the sun, moon, planetss and all of the heavens revolve around california!! i dont live there and wouldnt want to visit since california attempts to control how every other state operates, why bother thetruthburns i lived in california when it was the golden state – i now refer to it as the golden toilet bowl. sadly if enough states act like california then those of us who can’t take it will have to move to another country. man – what the hell ever happened to the good ole usa? gregory chandler california’s government leaders tend to have the attitude, this is california so we do as you please. this attitude is the same among liberals and conservatives. many people who live in california conduct a substantial amount of business elsewhere. therefore, you get the beauty of california without all of the silliness. craig hempfling can’t wait for a good 9.9 quake to get rid of gov. brown and the rest of you idiots a-0 i have been traveling to nor cal for years for work. i consider all of california north mexico at this point. i conceal a firearm against state laws due to the out of control crime situation. i am also starting to pull all of my buisness out of state, if only i could do it sooner. jules forgot one huge thing on this list. california has the worst worker’s compensation in the country. it’s pro employer and con injuried worker. 90% of all major claims are denied even though multiple doctors including state issued qmes (qualified medical evaluator) agree that care is needed. in addition after a claim is denied an anonymous imr (independent medical review) can deny the claim without reasoning nor can ever be identified. also worker’s compensation payouts are the worst in the country even though we pay the most into it and have one of the highest cost of living. texanforever after working there for 40 years i retired back to west-central rural texas and haven’t regretted it one moment. i miss the beaches, ocean, “catalina eddy,” and the sound of seals barking at night as i go to sleep. but the crazyness brought on by the gang-bangers, the crazy southbay curve on the 405, the feel-good looney libs, the overly complex rules, the taxes, and governor moonbeam (not once but twice), makes it just not worth it. deer now come up into my yard at night to graze on the bermuda grass lawn. people drive down the streets at an unhurried laid-back 20 mph and wave at each other, whether sitting on porches or in pick-ups. … even though they might not know each other. kids say “yes ma’am” and “no ma’am,” and adults do too, regardless of age differences. it’s a more civil way of life. there are loaded pistols, rifles, and shotguns in every house but there is virtually no crime, and no one ever gets shot. i can go to town and leave all my doors open and unlocked. can’t say i don’t miss california, but it’s the old california i miss, not the insane place it has become, thanks entirely to the marxist liberals. fembot220 i don’t like california that much. nor cal is a hard place to live and off the charts when it comes to cost of living. i’m moving to the midwest where people are conservative and you can rent a house for what you would pay for a crappy closet sized apartment out here. wayne baumback sounds like a little jealousy. facebook, apple, twitter, google, tesla, intel, ebay, craigslist, oracle, and can go on forever are doing so poorly, high taxes and govt regulations. even mitt romney campaigned against high taxes and govt regulation, then lost the election and moved to calif.",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,8.036363636363637,0.09090909090909091,0.0
trump’s latest tweet has a glaring mistake that shows how stupid (or psychotic) he is (tweet),"it was hard to imagine donald trump getting any dumber during his presidential campaign, but he s truly outdone himself in the weeks after winning the election. not only has the president-elect been unintelligently tweeting up a storm, ditching protocol press pools and making every attempt to hide the $25 million lawsuit he just settled for fraud, but he is letting america know that he has no idea what presidents actually do.we ve seen trump s complete ignorance of widely known facts before, like the time he told his own supporters the incorrect voting date. at a florida rally, trump had with full confidence told his fanbase to vote on november 28th, a full 20 days off from the real voting date. today, trump reminded us of this moment when he reinforced the fact that he still doesn t know what s going on.this morning, trump notified everyone over twitter that there would be a meeting at trump tower today with the people (aka the white supremacists) who will run our government for the next eight years. huh? great meetings will take place today at trump tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. twittereither trump is completely unaware that a president s term is only four years, or he s completely delusional about how long he s actually going to last in the white house. we wouldn t be surprised if trump thinks one term is actually 8 years, considering how clueless he is and his lack of knowledge about the united states constitution, which clearly says: the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america. he shall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the vice-president chosen for the same term for him to think that he s going to have the success that president obama had and be elected for two terms is hilarious. obama has a tremendously high approval rating, and trump s approval rating is historically low. he s certainly in for a rude awakening if he thinks he s got eight years of dictatorship ahead of him.featured image via win mcnamee/getty images",1,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.047619047619047616,6.8750000000000036,8.9,0.0625,0.0
trump’s gettysburg address against the new world order,"tweet home » headlines » finance news » trump’s gettysburg address against the new world order the trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the nwo globalists. submitted by james hall : if not now, when? only the most dedicated totalitarian collectivist would want to keep the nwo in power. those who are so dim-witted to believe that the governance elites are legitimate rulers, exercising moral authority are so ignorant and illiterate that they deserve the fate of sheep taken to the slaughter. the sheeple designation is apt for a society mired in a distorted reality of serfdom. the new world order moved from a century’s old scheme to enslave humanity into a consolidated “ international community ”, when the central banksters organized the bank for international settlements, with the adoption of the bretton woods system of monetary management, the reorganization of nation states with the end of world war ii, the creation of the globalist united nations and the establishment of the centralized bureaucracy of the european union. the trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the nwo globalists. it is because of this opposition to the transnational ruling despots that the vicious, deceitful and unending assault on trump and his followers has been unleashed, since real meaningful change cannot be allowed that would reverse the systematic destruction of western civilization. read the entire pledge of action that was presented as the 21 st century gettysburg address or watch the video . donald j. trump contract with the american voter what follows is my 100-day action plan to make america great again. it is a contract between myself and the american voter – and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to washington. therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in washington, dc: first, propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of congress; second, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); third, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; fourth, a 5 year-ban on white house and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; fifth, a lifetime ban on white house officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;

establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the u.s. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations;

why mike bloomberg running for president will bring us president trump,"while having a third independent option for president is surely a democratic thing to do, the implications surrounding someone like former new york city mayor mike bloomberg jumping into the race are huge.what would bloomberg running as an independent on the ticket mean? well, it would pull votes from a major party candidate, and in this election, that candidate will be the democratic one. because while bloomberg could appeal to wealthy conservatives, he s staunchly pro-heavy gun regulations, which will turn the remainder of the republican base off in a heart beat. so, any votes he pulls will be from moderate to right-leaning democrats, as well as independents who may be leaning towards the democratic candidate. this is especially true if bernie sanders is the nominee and people are apprehensive about a democratic socialist in the white house. however, it d be true of hillary clinton as well.so with the center votes missing from the democratic candidate, and surely not enough votes for bloomberg taken from either side, this leaves the republicans with a clear path to victory, and with donald trump trouncing his opposition in the polls, we re looking at a trump presidency.now, unless bloomberg has some secret, backdoor deal with trump that no one is keenly aware of, the former mayor of new york city needs to put his dreams of the oval office on the shelf, and likely keep them there for good. the last thing this nation needs is a president trump. a person, who as president, would alienate not only all the minorities in his own country, but would alienate the united states from the rest of the world. we d be an embarrassment. even more so than when george w. bush was president.so, please, bloomberg, if you happen to read this, take all that was just said to heart and think about what you really, truly want for the nation. if you want president trump, then by all means, run. however, if not, please don t. not just for you and the nation, but for the entire world.featured image: flickr/flickr",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.09090909090909091,6.936363636363637,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
government hiding unprecedented tb infection rates among relocated refugees,"home › health › government hiding unprecedented tb infection rates among relocated refugees government hiding unprecedented tb infection rates among relocated refugees 0 shares [10/26/16] j.d. heyes- more americans might be accepting of president barack obama’s zealous push to flood the country with refugees from war-torn parts of the world, if only he, along with federal and state officials, were more transparent about the entire process. like for instance being up front with americans about the health threat posed by many of these refugees. breitbart news is reporting that officials at the michigan department of health and human services, county health departments throughout the state and local offices of refugee resettlement agencies – all of whom are working closely with the obama administration – have taken to hiding the latent tuberculosis infection rates among refugees from the general public. the website noted further that the “culture of concealment” in michigan contrasts with how several other states deal with latent tb infection rates among refugees. as breitbart news has reported in the past , the michigan department of health and human services doesn’t collect latent tb infection rate information from county health departments or local resettlement agencies it hires to perform initial medical screenings of newly-arrived refugees. also, the state agency obviously does not honor its legal obligation to do so under provisions of the refugee act of 1980. michigan officials not keeping tb data required by law when the news service asked mdhhs officials for data about latent tb infection rates based on the full population of refugees screened, a spokesman for the agency, bob wheaton, said, “we do not have that data.” breitbart noted that the agency has hired a number of county health departments, and in some counties private refugee health screening services, all working in cooperation with local resettlement officials for the purpose of conducting initial medical screenings of all new refugee arrivals. under guidelines from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention and mdhhs, all refugees who complete initial health screenings are tested for latent tb infection. however, mdhhs officials said that neither the counties nor private agencies are sharing screening data. what’s more, the counties and private refugee health screeners who do have the tb data will not make that information available to the public. as breitbart news noted further: “in the case of at least one private refugee health screening service, the arab american and chaldean council, which mdhhs has hired to conduct refugee health screenings in wayne county, macomb county, and oakland county, that data is also not being shared with health departments in those counties.” again, the provision of the data is a requirement of federal statutes regarding the health screening status of refugees. one-third of the rest of the world has latent tb many states have made this information public in annual reports. they include minnesota, where the latent tb infection rate among newly-arrived refugees in 2014 was 22 percent; indiana (26 percent); arizona (18 percent); utah (18 percent), texas (15 percent); california (12 percent) and florida (12 percent). in addition, breitbart news noted, other states made information available to the news service after repeated requests. they include tennessee (27 percent); vermont (35 percent); and idaho (21 percent). it is vital to identify refugees coming into the united states with latent tb infections, because treatment must begin immediately in order to prevent the spread of the disease. also, studies – including one from the university of california, san diego in 2013 – have shown that higher rates of latent tb infection among resettled refugees pose a greater health risk to the general public in regions where they have been sent. latent tb turns into a public health risk when it activates into infectious tb, a process that is generally associated with lower levels of immunity among those with latent tb. in the u.s., 4 percent of the general population has latent tb; 10 percent of those develop active tb at some point during their lives. by contrast, fully one-third – 33 percent – of the rest of the world has latent tb, breitbart news reported. post navigation",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,20.697777777777777,21.37777777777778,0.0,0.0

nikki haley inadvertently supports obama’s refugee policy while exploiting the charleston massacre (video),"tuesday night, after president obama gave his final state of the union address, governor nikki haley (r-sc) delivered the republican rebuttal. during her speech, though, she accidentally supported the democratic party s syrian refugee policy while trying to exploit the charleston massacre to take political shots at donald trump.after she was finished calling president obama a failure, governor haley turned her attention to our immigration problem and the syrian refugee crisis, saying: at the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. we can t do that. we cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally. and in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined. that line about refugees is one republicans often say to justify their refusal to help the desperate families fleeing from unthinkable violence in syria. while this comment was not surprising, later on she said something that sounded an awful lot like a contradiction.towards the middle of her speech, governor haley spoke about the mother emanuel massacre that took the lives of nine black churchgoers when a white supremacist decided that he wanted to start a race war. she said: this past summer, south carolina was dealt a tragic blow. on an otherwise ordinary wednesday evening in june, at the historic mother emanuel church in charleston, twelve faithful men and women, young and old, went to bible study. that night, someone new joined them. he didn t look like them, didn t act like them, didn t sound like them. they didn t throw him out. they didn t call the police. instead, they pulled up a chair and prayed with him. for an hour. she went on to take a not-so-subtle shot at donald trump: we didn t turn against each other s race or religion. we turned toward god, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world. so, while trying to exploit the charleston massacre and taking shots at trump, she accidentally supported obama s policies. she said even though dylann roof did not look like the mother emanuel churchgoers, they embraced him because those are real american values. haley is absolutely right! that is what our country is all about.the united states was built on the intrinsic belief that we are a free nation that welcomes everyone especially the desperate, downtrodden souls of other nations. we are also a nation the does not let the fear of others overcome us and scare us into not helping people. obviously, by this statement, she understands that the syrian refugees perfectly fit this description and we should open our arms just like the beautiful victims of the charleston did. i m sure that if you ask her if she meant her comments in this way, she ll say no and that is what makes them so great.thanks for the support, governor haley! obama appreciates it!watch her rebuttal below:featured image via video screenshot",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,18.52615384615385,23.661538461538463,0.0,0.0

"jake tapper, tom price battle over medicaid ’broken promise’ - breitbart","sunday on cnn’s “state of the union,” jake tapper pressed health secretary tom price on the american health care act’s cuts from medicaid. the exchange opened with tapper asking, “according to the congressional budget office, the health care bill that just passed the house would cut $880 billion over ten years from medicaid. i know that the trump administration is excited that medicaid will go back to the states where they have more control and can experiment and be more efficient, but without question, $880 billion fewer dollars is a cut. how is this not a broken promise?” price answered, “look at the medicaid promise that program that we have right now and of physicians that should be seeing medicaid patients aren’t. there a flaw in the program. imagine a system that works better for patients. medicaid deals with disabled, elderly, healthy moms and kids. and yet the federal government has said to the states up to this point you have to treat every sink gel one of those individuals exactly the same. that doesn’t make sense to anybody. so what we’re fashioning is a system that would allow the states to tailor that medicaid program to those specific individuals saving money but also a higher level of care than they currently do. sounds like it makes a lot of sense. ” follow pam key on twitter @pamkeynen",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.73,12.0,0.0,0.0
obama confronts complexity of using a mighty cyberarsenal against russia - the new york times,"washington — over the past four months, american intelligence agencies and aides to president obama assembled a menu of options to respond to russia’s hacking during the election, ranging from the obvious — exposing president vladimir v. putin’s financial ties to oligarchs — to the innovative, including manipulating the computer code that russia uses in designing its cyberweapons. but while mr. obama vowed on friday to “send a clear message to russia” as both a punishment and a deterrent, some of the options were rejected as ineffective, others as too risky. if the choices had been better, one of the aides involved in the debate noted recently, the president would have acted by now. in his last weeks in office, that situation room debate has confronted a naturally cautious president with a complex calculus that donald j. trump will soon inherit: how to use the world’s most powerful cyberarsenal at a moment when the united states, as the election showed, remains highly vulnerable. “is there something we can do to them, that they would see, they would realize 98 percent that we did it, but that wouldn’t be so obvious that they would then have to respond for their own honor?” david h. petraeus, the former director of the central intelligence agency under mr. obama, asked on friday, at a conference here sponsored by harvard’s belfer center for science and international affairs. “the question is how subtle do you want it, how damaging do you want it, how do you try to end it here rather than just ratchet it up?” the idea of exposing mr. putin’s links to oligarchs was set aside after some aides argued that it would not come as a shock to russians. still, there are proposals to cut off leaders in mr. putin’s inner circle from their hidden bank accounts in europe and asia. there is an option to use sanctions under a executive order to ban international travel for senior officials in the g. r. u. the russian military intelligence unit that american spy agencies say stole emails from the democratic national committee and hillary clinton’s campaign chairman, then doled them out to wikileaks, betting that media outlets eager for insider details would amplify them, doing the kremlin’s work for it. the national security agency and its military cousin, the united states cyber command, which is responsible for warfare, have worked up other ideas, officials said, though some have been rejected by the pentagon. those plans could deploy the arsenal of cyberweapons assembled at a cost of billions of dollars during mr. obama’s tenure to expose or neutralize some of the hacking tools favored by russia’s spies — the digital equivalent of a strike. but the selection of targets by americans and the accuracy of that retaliation could also expose software “implants” that the united states has patiently inserted and nurtured in russian networks, in case of future cyberconflicts. and the revelation in august about some of the n. s. a. ’s own tools for breaking into foreign computer networks has raised the possibility that the russians are already inside american networks and are sending a warning that they can respond in kind. all of this has led mr. obama to ask how the russians might escalate the confrontation, and whether the united states in the end may have more to lose than russia. “he doesn’t have great options,” said michael d. mcfaul, formerly one of mr. obama’s top national security aides and then his ambassador to moscow. mr. obama is the president who, in his first year in office, reached for some of the most sophisticated cyberweapons on earth to blow up parts of iran’s nuclear facilities. now, at the end of his presidency, he has run headlong into a different challenge in the cyberwarfare arena. the president has reached two conclusions, senior officials report: the only thing worse than not using a weapon is using it ineffectively. and if he does choose to retaliate, he has insisted on maintaining what is known as “escalation dominance,” the ability to ensure you can end a conflict on your terms. mr. obama hinted as much at his news conference on friday, as he was set to leave for his annual hawaii vacation, his last as president. “our goal continues to be to send a clear message to russia or others not to do this to us because we can do stuff to you,” he said. “but it is also important to us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. some of it, we will do publicly. some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will. ” he rejected calls for a big, symbolic show of power, dismissing the idea that if the united states “thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the russians. ” the goal, mr. obama said, was to come up with a response “that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future but does not create problems for us. ” there is not much new in tampering with elections, except for the technical sophistication of the tools. for all the outrage voiced by democrats and republicans in the past week about the russian action — with the notable exception of mr. trump, who has dismissed the intelligence findings as politically motivated — it is worth remembering that trying to manipulate elections is a american art form. the c. i. a. got its start trying to influence the outcome of italy’s elections in 1948, as the author tim weiner documented in his book “legacy of ashes,” in an effort to keep communists from taking power. five years later, the c. i. a. engineered a coup against mohammad mossadegh, iran’s democratically elected leader, when the united states and britain installed the shah. “the military coup that overthrew mosaddeq and his national front cabinet was carried out under cia direction as an act of u. s. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government,” the agency concluded in one of its own reports, declassified around the 60th anniversary of those events, which were engineered in large part by kermit roosevelt jr. a grandson of president theodore roosevelt. there were similar interferences over the years in guatemala, chile and even in japan, hailed as a model of war ii democracy, where the liberal democratic party owes its early grip on power in the 1950s and 1960s to millions of dollars in covert c. i. a. support. the only differences this year are that the effort was directed at the united states, and that it was cyberenabled, giving moscow a tool to amplify its efforts through the echo chamber of social media and news organizations that quoted from the leaked emails. “what has changed is that this was using cyberspace for advancing a political objective,” said adm. james a. winnefeld jr. who served as vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff until he retired last year. cybertechniques, he said, have amplified an old form of “political warfare, and the issue is not whether it successfully influenced the election — but the fact that they did it. ” over the past few months, an administration that prided itself on its work on cyberoffense and cyberdefense has learned a hard lesson: when it came to the 2016 election, an economically failing russia, dismissed by mr. obama on friday for its inability to grow or to innovate, exploited giant holes in the american system. mr. obama conceded that he first heard about the attack on the democratic national committee “early last summer,” or nine months after the f. b. i. first alerted d. n. c. officials about what had happened. that now appears to be critical lost time. if mr. obama had confronted the russians immediately, in public or in the kind of private warning he said he delivered to mr. putin only three months ago during a meeting in china, the united states might have derailed the hacking campaign before it harvested and revealed thousands of emails. but the election hacking also raised questions about whether the american fixation on a “cyber pearl harbor” — a devastating attack on the power grid, cellphone network, financial system or gas pipelines — overlooked a more obvious vulnerability. as a detailed account in the new york times last wednesday revealed, the d. n. c. had virtually no protections for its electronic systems, and mrs. clinton’s campaign chairman, john d. podesta, had failed to sign up for the “ authentication” on his gmail account. doing so probably would have foiled what mr. obama called a fairly primitive attack. now the question facing mr. obama is how public a retaliation to execute. the president laid out a case on friday for acting with subtlety, so as not to start a conflict. but as joseph nye, a strategist on soft power, noted on friday, “the reason to make some of this public is not just to deter the russians, it is to deter others as well,” in future elections. it is possible, said mr. mcfaul, the former ambassador to russia, that mr. obama’s most lasting contribution may be to get the details of the russian hack declassified and to publish a report he has instructed the intelligence community to assemble before he leaves office. “given that obama only has a few more weeks in office, i think he needs to focus his remaining time on attribution — that is declassification of intelligence so that there is no ambiguity about the russian actions,” mr. mcfaul said. that “is completely within his powers,” he added, and would spur more congressional investigations regardless of the stance taken by mr. trump on the hack. mr. obama’s comments on friday have led democrats to demand further action. representative adam b. schiff of california, the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee, said the response should mix “additional economic sanctions along with our allies, and clandestine means of exacting a cost on the russians for their flagrant meddling in our election. ” “i have little confidence,” he continued, “that the incoming president will take the actions necessary to make the russians pay any price for the most consequential ‘active measures’ campaign against us in history. ”",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.62714285714286,14.171428571428573,0.0,0.0

michael brown’s father on ferguson riots: ’they asked for it’,"the father of michael brown accused the city of ferguson of “asking for” the riots that plagued the city following his son’s death. [his comments came in response to the release of a film, “stranger fruit,” during austin, texas’ south by southwest film festival. the film reportedly reveals new video footage taken from a market in ferguson michael brown was accused of robbing, cnn reported. director jason pollock claims brown did not rob the store as widely reported, but was simply picking up some cigarillos the clerks had given him in exchange for marijuana. the film’s producers accuse the city of ferguson of hiding this video and only releasing the later video with claims brown was robbing the store. “maybe the city of ferguson wouldn’t have gotten tore up like that,” michael brown sr. said during a press conference about the video. “it’s almost like they asked for it, if you ask me, for not keeping no truth in there. ” ferguson police responded to the claim by the senior brown, stating that michael brown was not initially stopped in connection with the incident at the store. he was stopped for walking in the middle of the road, cnn stated. the riots that erupted following the shooting death of michael brown by a ferguson police officer had nothing to do with anything that happened at the store, or even the facts of brown’s encounter with the police officer. rather, the riots broke out following a false “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative put forward by politically motivated activists. the riots were further fueled by the obama administration’s fanning the flames with rhetoric that supported the false narrative, breitbart news reported in 2015. “now the campaign of terror against police has come back to where the great lie started. obama and holder will not finish until they have destroyed ferguson — destroyed it, in the parlance of the vietnam era, in order to save it, razed it to rebuild it in the stylized image of selma 1965, razed it in order to fit the delusions of an attorney general who thinks we have made no progress since the era of malcolm x and a president who once promised — incredibly! — to unite america,” breitbart’s joel pollock wrote at the time. breitbart news reported extensively on the aftermath of the shooting in ferguson and the subsequent riots and political chaos that arose over the next several months. the release of the new video sparked a new round of protests in ferguson over the weekend, cnn reported. during a protest sunday night, a ferguson police officer’s nose was broken after a female protester punched him in the face. brandon darby contributed to this report. darby serves as breitbart texas managing director and . he the cartel chronicles project with ildefonso ortiz and stephen k. bannon. follow him on twitter and facebook. bob price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for breitbart texas. he is a founding member of the breitbart texas team. follow him on twitter @bobpricebbtx and facebook.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.14285714285714285,6.010000000000002,8.0,0.0,0.0

political temperature has cooled down,"by brig asif h. raja on november 3, 2016 asif haroon raja the political temperature that had begun to boil from 28 october onward became menacing on the following three days, but mercifully it scaled down dramatically on the evening of november 01 after imran khan (ik) decided to call off his much hyped foray into islamabad (isbd) on november 2. ik led pti had been drumming up the panama papers scandal since april 2016 and straining their lungs to demean nawaz sharif (ns) and implicate him and his family on charges of corruption and money laundering. earlier on, ik had made rigging in 2013 elections into a big issue and undertaken 126-day sit-in at d-chowk isbd to implicate pml-n and topple the govt. despite the physical assault on the parliament, pm house and the ptv, the protest fizzled out without achieving any results. ik had to tender an apology to the judicial commission when his legal team failed to produce any evidence to prove the rigging charge. ik covered up his embarrassment by saying that “rigging was just a political stunt for point scoring”. he then shifted his goal post from rigging to corruption and in that panama scandal came as a godsend opportunity to push his chief rival against the wall and possibly unseat him. irrespective of the fact that ns name was absent from the list of account holders in the offshore company in panama, and several of his party’s leading lights including himself were maintaining offshore accounts, he insisted that accountability should start from ns and his two sons based in london and daughter marium only and none else. he emphasized on immediate resignation of ns and quoted weak examples of pm of iceland who had resigned and pm uk who presented himself for accountability. other political parties like the ppp, ji, pml-q and aml joined his battle to put ns in the dock. the two sides got locked over the issue of terms of reference (tors), the opposition demanding commencement of investigation by supreme court from ns and his family, while the govt maintained that ns name should be excluded since he had not been named, and that accountability should be across the board. the tussle consumed 6-7 months without any breakthrough. feeling frustrated, ik once again decided to show muscle power on the streets and after several public meetings held a big gathering at raiwind on sept 30. he had all the intentions to move forward and organize a sit-in in front of jati umra (private residence of ns), but truculence expressed by pml-n activists and reluctance of other political parties to join him, coupled with heating up of loc and threat of surgical strike by india restrained him, and he decided to wrap it up the same night. he however, pledged to invade and lock down isbd on october 30 and force ns to quit or offer himself for accountability. he built up the tempo throughout october and made efforts to take as many political parties on board. social media and electronic media in particular demonized ns and made him into an object of hate. most political parties and saner elements advised ik to change his plan of confrontation in the wake of acceptance of case of panama scandal for hearing by the supreme court, but he refused and remained adamant. having discovered the foul intentions of pti, the govt announced that all out efforts will be made to prevent the activists of pti and their partners from besieging isbd on october 30. punjab police and frontier constabulary were requisitioned to bolster the strength of isbd police and containers from all over punjab were impounded to block the roads leading to isbd. hawks within the ruling party also flexed their muscles and showed readiness for the combat. in the meanwhile, ghq’s annoyance over security leak gave a shot in the arm to the agitators and it was assumed that the army would be on their side and gen raheel would raise his finger once the desired chaos was stoked. to neutralize one front, ns hastened to sack information minister pervaiz rashid and a high powered inquiry was ordered to trace the culprits and punish them. pervaiz ouster was rejoiced by pti but the sacrifice was considered too small. they wanted a bigger head to be rolled and their obvious target was ns and none else. quite a few critics of pervaiz are now shedding tears of sympathy. the date of incursion was advanced to november 2. refusal of ppp and pat to join up for the d day was a setback for the pti, but it decided to once again take the suicidal plunge single-handed. its main dependence was on the main effort launched from kp by the pti workers under the command of chief minister (cm) pervez khattak. ik repeatedly underlined that a force of one million will assemble in isbd. armed tiger force had been trained to deal with the police and paramilitary forces. secondary effort was to be launched from the direction of lahore and pml-q activists under ch brothers were to join the party from gujrat. purpose was to flood the capital city with people, choke the city, paralyze the administration, parliament and judiciary and give a fait-accompli to ns to either voluntarily step down peacefully, or be ready to be brought down forcibly. tahirul qadri’s zealots were expected to join the gathering to dig the last nail. ns ouster on yet to be proven corruption charges in their view would cook the goose of pml-n and victory will be theirs. knowing that the panama case didn’t have required strength to convict ns, they wanted to decide the case their way through street agitation. they also understood that each passing day was tilting the balance in favor of pml-n due to fast paced developments and cpec and in next elections pti’s chance of winning will become very bleak. for them, this was the only chance to get rid of ns, and hence decided to take a huge risk without constitutional and legal cover. like in 2014, they assumed that army was on their side. blinded by their quest for power, they turned a blind eye to the possible socio-political turmoil that may erupt as a result of their reckless venture to scuttle the democratic process. they ignored the possibility of takeover by the army in the wake of commotion. ik’s bellicosity and rashness was motivated by his rancor with ns family, and his obsession to acquire the coveted seat of pm. in every speech, he and sheikh rashid used foul language and ridiculed the pm brazenly. many are of the view that ik may be having hidden malicious intentions to pursue sinister goals at the behest of hostile forces to pakistan. his detractors particularly maulana fazlur rehman, who himself has a shady past, dubs him as an agent of israel. others say that his fascist methods resemble mqm’s fascism and give strength to indo-us-israel-western agenda to foment chaos. they have seen the fate of iraq, libya, yemen and syria and know that pakistan is the next target. they particularly noted the ill-timed attack on isbd when india and afghanistan are breathing fire, the us is in highly rasping mood and china is getting worried over political uncertainty. last time the sit-in was timed with the scheduled visit of president of china which got postponed for six months and this time the peshawar-isbd road blockade coincided with the passage of first convoy from kashgar-khunjarab to gwadar along the western route. they ask as to why ik and his ilk cannot wait for may 2018 elections and gain power through a legitimate course rather than using high handed tactics. the preliminary offensive was intended to be launched under the garb of youth convention in isbd on october 28. this gathering was to exert pressure from within the city once the pincers from kp and punjab reached the premises of isbd. leaders and foot soldiers started collecting at bani gala which was to act as the command and control centre for “operation lockdown isbd”. having gained intelligence about the sinister plans afoot, the govt machinery sprang into action and ordered positioning of containers on all entry points into isbd as well as in bani gala. when the protesters became rowdy, the police baton charged and arrested pti workers of both genders. the scuffle and hide-and-seek which went on the whole night created a big scene and gave plentiful of grist to the media to sensationalize the event to the hilt. planned meeting of shiekh rashid in front of his residence lal haveli could not take place on october 30 but the sheikh managed to reach committee chowk riding a bike and delivered a short speech to the few people present there. this act of his was glorified by the media. the situation took a serious turn when the cm kp pervaiz khattak started a caravan from swabi on october 31 and not only hurled highly jingoistic statements but made things nasty by adding ethnic color to his diatribe against the govt. unmindful of his skinny and frail physique, he behaved like a conquering rambo ready to trounce any hurdle placed in his way. he expressed his determination to reach bana gala at all cost on the following day. he has nothing impressive to brag about in kp. most of development funds of the last year could not be spent and lapsed and no headway has been made on corruption. as regards the pti, there are visible cracks within the party and several top leaders like javed hashmi and justice wajihuddin have left the party. pti leaders have tainted past and several leading lights are the turncoats of other parties. performance of pti in bye-elections, local bodies, gilgit-baltistan and ajk has been dismal. these factors when seen in the backdrop of impressive performance of pml-n in tackling energy crisis and existential threat of terrorism and in improving economic indicators, gives no plausible reason to the pti to maneuver its premature downfall through hooliganism. the govt in anticipation had placed series of containers on the three interchanges along the motorway at swabi, hazro and burhan and deployed heavy contingent of police equipped with heavy stocks of tear gas shells. khattak made use of the cranes to remove the containers but the barrage of tear gas shells and baton charge by police had a toll on the pti tigers. the caravan lost its steam and was ultimately grounded at burhan. it was in this timeframe that the first cargo convoy of 100 vehicles was to cross the interchanges to reach the motorway of cpec. cognizant of its importance the army soldiers helped in clearing the mess on critical interchanges. when ik realized that he and other leaders of his party stranded in his house in bani gala cannot move out and join party workers braving the hardships and that khattak led men will not be able to reach isbd, he was in a dilemma. possibility of a bigger clash at burhan resulting in casualties couldn’t be ruled out. the govt was in no mood to soften up its stance. the other factor was failure to mobilize the party workers and bring them to isbd in sufficient numbers. the total strength didn’t exceed 20-25000. ik and his colleagues wanted to call off the sit-in but not the party men. the supreme court gave the much needed face saving formula by offering to frame the tors in case the govt and opposition parties failed to do so and also promised to start hearing the panama case and expedite its completion as early as possible. ik was allowed to hold a peaceful meeting at parade ground. the court also ordered removal of containers. these offers were promptly accepted and ik announced the withdrawal on a triumphant note saying that november 2 will be celebrated as ‘thanksgiving day’ with fanfare. rather than appreciating his decision, hyper media sank into a pool of sadness. same was the case with opposition parties and pti activists that were expecting the party to remain in full swing for full month if not more. eight raw/ib agents based in indian high commission in isbd in the garb of diplomats having dangerous plans up their sleeves felt so depressed that they became indiscreet and got exposed. ik once again boasted of assembling one million but had to eat his words. true to commitment, the supreme court held its first session on november 3 in which ns and ik appeared. next hearing of the court will be on monday in which children of ns would also appear. ik and his team are very hopeful that the court would give verdict in their favor but in case of unfavorable decision, he will again come on the roads. relations of pti with ppp and pat have become frosty, while sheikh rashid is also feeling out of sorts. reportedly an understanding has been forged between pml-n, ppp and mqm-altaf, but apparently the ppp is trying to change its posture from friendly to genuine opposition to outdo pti. the writer is retired brig, war veteran, defence analyst, columnist, author of 5 books, vice chairman thinkers forum pakistan, dg measac

two dead in protests as south korea formally ousts president - breitbart,"south korea’s park has become the first president in its history to be ousted from power via impeachment following allegations of granting inappropriate government access to a senior member of a organization. [koreans took to the streets after the announcement of the impeachment both to protest and celebrate, with one seoul rally leaving two dead and two critically injured. koreans took to the streets after the announcement of the impeachment both to protest and celebrate, with one seoul rally leaving two dead and two critically injured. after an extended investigation process, the nation’s constitutional court ruled that park would be immediately stripped of her power as chief executive. south korea will hold a presidential election within 60 days to replace her, one that many believe will benefit the leftist opposition party. park is the first south korean president to be removed in such a way. the announcement triggered assemblies — both protests and rallies — almost immediately, as some had begun congregating before the ouster became public to share the moment. in seoul, two senior citizens were killed amid the chaos. according to the south korean news agency yonhap, the victims were two men named kim (no relation) one aged 72 and the other, 66. the elder kim died after being bludgeoned in the head with a large speaker. “kim was found bleeding from his head near the court at around 1 p. m.,” yonhap reports. the younger kim “was found unconscious at a subway station,” but police have not identified a cause of death publicly yet. police arrested one man in relation to the death of the elder kim, who was seen ramming a vehicle into the police car carrying that speaker that ultimately hit kim. yonhap reports that two others are “in critical condition” but has not revealed any more information. the outlet added that, while one of the deaths appears accidental, many protesters took the streets of seoul carrying “makeshift weapons, such as wooden sticks” to use against police. cnn reports that seoul placed 21, 000 police officers on standby in case protests turned violent. that reality appeared to materialize rapidly, as dozens of protesters attempted to break police lines to storm into the courthouse where the impeachment decision was announced. while many lamented the end of park’s tenure as president, leftists took seoul’s streets to celebrate. yonhap reports that some businesses offered free food and drink to celebrate, while a movie theater offered free viewings. leftist did not appear fully satisfied, however, as they chanted “arrest park !” following the impeachment announcement. also among those celebrating is the government of north korea. pyongyang had long reviled park, an aggressive opponent of the communist dictatorship whose parents were both assassinated by north korean agents. on friday, the government propaganda newspaper rodong sinmun published a final farewell to park, addressing her as the “witch of chongwadae [the blue house, south korea’s presidential palace]. ” “nothing is more foolish than the efforts of the traitor and her group to stem the trend of the times,” a rodong editorial read. “with the publication of the special investigation results, park is fated to be recorded as the worst ‘president’ and meet the most shameless end in the south korean history of politics. ” what park’s ouster means for the volatile relations between north and south korea remains unclear. the leftist opposition in seoul has long called for more diplomacy with pyongyang and less cooperation with allies like the united states. america began deploying the first parts of a defense system known as thaad (terminal high altitude area defense) this week, intended to protect from rogue north korean rockets. should south korea elect a leftist president, such defenses may no longer be in the cards for that nation. the south korean unification ministry issued a statement friday insisting it would “maintain steady preparedness” following her removal. park was impeached following the revelation that a close friend of hers, choi had been privy to classified information and given the opportunity to edit park’s nationals security speeches. choi has ties to a group called the “eternal life church,” which many in south korea consider a cult. park issued multiple apologies following the revelation, while choi issued a statement insisting that her illicit government involvement “deserves death. ”",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.154545454545456,18.94545454545455,0.08333333333333333,0.0

propaganda: star trek beyond – social justice warriors in space,"jay dyer 21st century wirethe last star trek reboot saw benedict cumberbatch as kahn, the berserk super soldier who was angry about the federation doing some such nefarious thing to his people group. this installment included curious references to false flags which i detailed here.before that, in the initial reboot, there was an angry alien who attacked the federation over his tribal group being shat upon (or, shatnered upon!). so, for the third time in a row, we have roughly the same plot of dispossessed discontent tribalists and unique people groups who become terrorists when their way of life is encroached upon by the united nations, er, nato, er, new world order, er federation.we have seen this pattern often in the star trek, but in the recent installment, it s even more pronounced as we discover the character sulu is gay. indeed, trans-specism and the destruction of people groups under liberal tyranny has always been the worldview of star trek gene roddenberry was a rabidly atheistic globalist (or, as an even darker possibility, was roddenberry a member of an occultic group known as the nine, ?).there is some interesting evidence connecting roddenberry (connected to the esalen institute which i covered here) to esoteric groups, mind control and the rand corporation. this would explain the many gnostic, scientistic, platonic and at times interestingly philosophical episodes, in the original series and its next generation successor.secret sun blog explains: so if you were hawking a sci-fi religion, who better to approach than the creator of the sci-fi sensation of the early/mid 70s? from 2008:in early 1975, a broke and depressed roddenberry was approached by a british former race car driver named sir john whitmore, who was associated with a strange organization called lab-9. though unknown to the public, lab-9 were ostensibly a sort of an independent version of the x-files, dedicated to the research of paranormal phenomena. however, lab-9 had another, more complex agenda- they later claimed to be in contact with a group of extraterrestrials called the council of nine lab-9 had wanted to hire roddenberry to write a screenplay based on the council of nine s imminent return .lab-9 flew him out to their headquarters, located on a large estate in ossining, ny. there, roddenberry met and interviewed several psychics, and prepared the groundwork for his script.roddenberry wrote a script called the nine, in which he fictionalized his experiences at lab-9 and the message for humanity that the council of nine wished to convey beam me up, rand!(t)his was no ragtag bunch of hippie phreaks that roddenberry was dealing with roddenberry biographer joel engel noted that whitmore introduced roddenberry to several key figures in the british broadcasting corp. as well. in regard to the connection to rand, opsecnews states:according to the trekplace website harvey p. lynn, jr. (?-1987), a member of the prestigious rand corporation, provided star trek original series creator gene roddenberry with scientific and technical advice during preproduction of the series.on the rand corporation s website the question is asked whether a rand researcher designed the initial bridge of the enterprise. the answer given is, a rand researcher, harvey lynn, was consulted, but as a private citizen, not as part of a rand project. however in an interview from 1965 jeffrey hunter, who played captain christopher pike in the star trek pilot the cage and preceded william shatner as first captain of the enterprise stated, the things that intrigues me the most is that it is actually based on the rand corporation s projection of things to come. except for the fictional characters, it will be like getting a look into the future and some of the predictions will surely come true in our lifetime. the inherent contradiction that star trek continually demonstrates is the contradiction of the liberal philosophy and i mean in this in the classically liberal sense, that radical egalitarianism and atomistic individualism creates a horrid collective gathered around nothing more than liberalism itself. in this way, liberalism and its epistemic and cultural relativism can only allow for itself, and must destroy and exclude all other options, including even non-liberal democracy.in numerous star trek episodes, we even see the prime directive of the federation s commitment to not violating an existing culture violated under the pretended facade of liberal rights and values. western ngos and foundations fulfill this very role today, with a cover of aiding the downtrodden, while secretly working for western political ends, as we see in the soros-funded white helmets scam. (if anyone doubts rand connections to hollywood, let s not forget the 2014 faux scandal of the interview). ironically, the new film demonstrates this toxic cultural imperialism explicitly. globalresearch explains: aside from not addressing the darker side of us foreign policy, hollywood movies like forrest gump carry subliminal messages. in the words of the us culture and entertainment magazine rolling stone: the message of forrest gump was that if you think about the hard stuff too much, you ll either get aids or lose your legs. meanwhile, the hero is the idiot who just shrugs and says whatever! whenever his country asks him to do something crazy. what rolling stone is saying that listen to what you are commanded to do.then there are movies like american sniper that collapse us foreign policy into the simplistic notion of individual characters. what this does is collapse the event and the soldiers into one, which means that if ones criticize a us war that you are attacking the soldiers and their convictions. this is hiding behind the soldiers and detracting from the real issue of an illegal invasion and occupation. nor is there any mention of abu ghraib or the false weapons of mass destruction lies. rolling stone had this to say about american sniper: sniper is a movie whose politics are so ludicrous and idiotic that under normal circumstances it would be beneath criticism. the only thing that forces us to take it seriously is the extraordinary fact that an almost exactly similar worldview consumed the walnut-sized mind of the president who got us into the war in question. it s the fact that the movie is popular, and actually makes sense to so many people, that s the problem, it also adds. in fact, as a result of the movie there was an increase in hate crimes in the us and negative feelings towards arabs and muslims. i was tempted to draw up an elaborate analysis of symbols and deeper meanings, but depth was absent in this film. other than an odd similarity between the terrorist character as a former soldier who went mad from radicalism (traditionalism!) being similar to the d.c. sniper event, admiral krall is merely a representation of any cultures or people groups who want a more traditional, organic existence and reject the federation s globalism. as such, they are terrorists who are impelled by their fury and insanity to bomb the glorious, multi-cultural megalopolis space city yorktown. in other words, all groups that aren t on board with globalism and liberal, inverted monoculture are terrists destined to attack new york.krall thus represents the life-extension inherent in the damned traditionalism that will not die in the face of globalism. krall is a grotesque icon of the film s view of patriarchal, honor-based societies as a perpetual reptilian madness that humans must evolve beyond. if you don t accept homo-mono-globo-liberalism, you are a terrorist that will unleash bioweapons in new york.the holy united nations and the space brothers have told the pentagon humanity must evolve beyond distinctions and borders, and gene and the pope are is its prophets. by the way if the citizens of the multi cultural yorktown space station can beam about at will, why didn t they just beam admiral krall into space when he had the bio weapon?oops! #starcuck #captainjamestkuckread more hollywood news at: 21st century wire hollywood filesto hear jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to jaysanalysis.jay dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, esoteric hollywood: sex, cults and symbols in film from trine day. focusing on film, philosophy, geopolitics and all things esoteric, jaysanalysis and his podcast, esoteric hollywood, investigates the deeper meanings between the headlines, exploring the hidden aspects of our sinister synthetic mass media matrix.",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0
pacific islanders may have dna of unknown human species,"science alert tue, 25 oct 2016 hints of an unidentified, extinct human species have been found in the dna of modern melanesians – those living in a region of the south pacific, northeast of australia. according to new genetic modelling, the species is unlikely to be neanderthal or denisovan – two ancient species that are represented in the fossil record – but could represent a third, unknown human relative that has so far eluded archaeologists. “we’re missing a population, or we’re misunderstanding something about the relationships,” ryan bohlender, a statistical geneticist from the university of texas, told tina hesman saey at science news. bohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extinct hominid dna that modern humans still carry today, and say they’ve found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with neanderthals and denisovans isn’t the whole story. it’s thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, our early ancestors migrated out of africa, and first made contact with other hominid species living on the eurasian landmass. this contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today, with europeans and asians carrying distinct genetic variants of neanderthal dna in their own genomes. and that’s not all they’ve given us. earlier this year, researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of european descent inherited from neanderthals , and found that they’re associated with several health problems, including a slightly increased risk of depression, heart attack, and a number of skin disorders. and a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts – otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (hpv) – were sexually transmitted to homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with neanderthals and denisovans once they left africa. while our relationship with neanderthals has been widely researched, how we interacted with the denisovans – the distant cousins of neanderthals – is less clear. the problem is that neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record, with many remains having been uncovered across europe and asia, but all we have of the denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a siberian cave in 2008 . using a new computer model to figure out the amount of neanderthal and denisovan dna carried by modern humans, bohlender and his colleague found that europeans and chinese people carry a similar amount of neanderthal dna: about 2.8 percent. that result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that europeans and asians carry, on average, between 1.5 and 4 percent neanderthal dna. but when they got to denisovan dna, things were a bit more complicated, particularly when it came to modern populations living in melanesia – a region of the south pacific that includes vanuatu, the solomon islands, fiji, papua new guinea, new caledonia, west papua, and the maluku islands. as hesman saey explains for science news: “europeans have no hint of denisovan ancestry, and people in china have a tiny amount – 0.1 percent, according to bohlender’s calculations. but 2.74 percent of the dna in people in papua new guinea comes from neanderthals. and bohlender estimates the amount of denisovan dna in melanesians is about 1.11 percent, not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers. while investigating the denisovan discrepancy, bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of melanesians.” “human history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was,” he told her. this find is supported by a separate study by researchers from the natural history museum of denmark, who analysed dna from 83 aboriginal australians and 25 locals from the papua new guinea highlands. as we reported last month, this was the most comprehensive genetic study of indigenous australians to date, and it indicated that they are the oldest continuous civilisation on earth, dating back more than 50,000 years ago. but the results revealed something else – dna that was very similar to that of the denisovans, but distinct enough for the researchers to suggest that it could have come from a third, unidentified hominid . “who this group is we don’t know,” lead researcher eske willerslev told hesman saey. until we have more concrete evidence of this hypothesised third human species (some fossils would be nice), we can’t prove this , and we should point out that bohlender’s estimates have yet to be formally peer-reviewed , so they might shift with further scrutiny. and it could be that our identification of denisovan dna is more ambiguous than we think, given that our only source is a finger bone and a couple of teeth. but the evidence is mounting that our interactions with ancient humans were far more complex than we’d assumed, which shouldn’t be much of a surprise, when you think about it. just because we don’t see them in the fossil record doesn’t mean they didn’t exist – preserving the remains of something for tens of thousands of years isn’t easy, and then someone has to be in the right place at the right time to dig them up. hopefully, the more we investigate the genetic make-up of our most ancient societies, the more hints we’ll get of the rich and complicated history our species shared with those that didn’t make it to modern times. the results of bohlender’s analysis were presented last week at the 2016 american society of human genetics meeting in canada. © guido amrein switzerland/shutterstock melanesian children of papua new guinea share:",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.520000000000003,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0
"tillerson says u.s., russia can settle problems, ease tension","manila (reuters) - u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on monday he believes washington and russia can find a way to ease tensions, saying it wouldn’t be useful to cut ties over the single issue of suspected russian meddling in the u.s. election. tillerson said russia had also expressed some willingness to resume talks about the crisis in ukraine, where a 2015 ceasefire between kiev’s forces and russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country is regularly violated. “we should find places we can work together... in places we have differences we’re going to have to continue to find ways to address those,” tillerson told reporters. tillerson met his russian counterpart, sergei lavrov, on the sidelines of an international gathering in manila on sunday, where he also asked about moscow’s retaliation against new u.s. sanctions. tillerson said he told lavrov the united states would respond to the kremlin’s order for it to cut about 60 percent of its diplomatic staff in russia by september 1. “we have not made a decision on how we will respond to russia’s request to remove u.s. diplomatic personnel. i asked several clarifying questions...i told him we would respond by september first,” tillerson said. the meeting was their first since president donald trump reluctantly signed into law the sanctions that russia said amounted to a full-scale trade war and ended hopes for better ties. lavrov on sunday said he believed his u.s. colleagues were ready to continue dialogue with moscow on complex issues despite tensions. tillerson said he discussed russia’s suspected meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election with lavrov to “help them understand how serious this incident had been and how seriously it damaged the relationship” between the two nations. but tillerson said that should not irreversibly damage ties. “the fact that we want to work with them on areas that are of serious national security interest to us, and at the same time having this extraordinary issue of mistrust that divides us, that is just what we in the diplomatic part of our relationship are required to do,” tillerson said. the united states sent its special representative on ukraine, kurt volker, a former u.s. envoy to nato, to ukraine last month to assess the situation in the former soviet republic. washington cites the conflict as a key obstacle to improved relations between russia and the united states. “we appointed a special envoy to engage with russia but also coordinating with all parties. this is full visibility to all parties. we are not trying to cut some kind of deal on the side,” tillerson said.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.520555555555557,1.8,0.0,0.0
trump’s vp pick attacked animated disney movie for being pro-woman,"mike pence, the presumptive republican nominee for vice president, once penned a screed attacking the disney animated musical mulan as liberal propaganda.before he was a member of congress and a governor, pence was the host of a right-wing radio show. as part of that show, pence wrote the column in 1999 attacking the musical. as a part of the hardcore religious right, pence was angry about the main character serving in the military.he complained: despite her delicate features and voice, disney expects us to believe that mulan s ingenuity and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal basis with her cloddish cohorts, wrote pence. obviously, this is walt disney s attempt to add childhood expectation to the cultural debate over the role of women in the military. he later wrote: i suspect that some mischievous liberal at disney assumes that mulan s story will cause a quiet change in the next generation s attitude about women in combat and they just might be right, pence continued. (just think about how often we think of bambi every time the subject of deer hunting comes into the mainstream media debate.) pence went on to claim that mulan proves that women shouldn t serve in combat: it is instructive that even in the disney film, young ms. mulan falls in love with her superior officer! me thinks the politically correct disney types completely missed the irony of this part of the story. yet in the film, while she does strike up a romance, she is also key to the victory of china over the invading hun, repelling his attempted invasion and defending the life of the emperor, who rewards her for her bravery.since the film s release, women have more options to them in the military. under president obama, all military positions are now open to women who are able to qualify for them, including in front line combat.despite pence s hostility to a cartoon character, he obviously doesn t hold a grudge as he has decided to run on a presidential ticket with one, albeit one less intelligent and capable than mulan.featured image via youtube/flickr",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.73,8.0,0.0,0.0
watch: mark cuban slays trump for scamming the working class,"donald trump is an unpatriotic loser, says real billionaire mark cuban, because true patriots actually pay their damn taxes.in 1995, the republican nominee wrote off a $915 million loss on his tax returns in order to get away with not paying any federal income taxes for the next 18 years while he continued to make hundreds of millions of dollars annually.as we all should know, taxes pay for a lot of the things that make our society great such as police, firefighters, hospitals, the military, roads, education, and many other things that are too numerous to mention. but trump got to enjoy the benefits of the things taxes pay for without having to contribute a single penny to pay for them. the rest of us, including hillary clinton and mark cuban picked up that tab.so cuban phoned in to cnn on tuesday, and while he conceded that what trump did is legal, he proceeded to blast him for failing to explain his actions. the key question, after showing a $915 million loss, is how much money does he owe still, who does he owe it to, was that debt forgiven because if it was forgiven, that s going to eat up that net operating loss, cuban said. debt forgiveness is the same as income. he hasn t explained any of those things in any way, shape or form. that s a problem. cuban then dinged trump for not taking personal responsibility for his mistakes and declared that trump is unfit to be president because of that refusal. the problem with donald trump and why he s unfit to be president, is that he won t own his mistakes. we all make mistakes. i ve had companies go belly-up. i say it all the time: it doesn t matter how many times you fail, you only have to be right one time and everybody will tell you how lucky you are. just own the mistake and explain it. the problem is there s no transparency, and he won t own his mistakes, and we don t want someone like that who s ashamed of what they ve done in the business world. being president means the buck stops at your desk, which means trump can t blame his underlings for all the bad decisions will likely make as president. we need a president that takes responsibility, not one that makes excuses.but cuban continued slamming trump for referring to himself as a smart for not paying taxes. that s just wrong. i say it all the time: after military service, the most patriotic thing you can do as a wealthy person is pay your taxes, because that keeps the roads paved, the military paid and kids going to school. he obviously doesn t understand the concept. here s the video via twitter.mark cuban responds to a report that donald trump may have legally avoided paying taxes for about two decades https://t.co/mwkq1f7nvr cnn politics (@cnnpolitics) october 3, 2016cuban is absolutely right. trump should pay his taxes like everyone else does because it would be unamerican to not pay them. former supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes once said that by paying taxes we buy civilization. by not paying taxes, trump is freeloading off the rest of us.featured image via screenshot",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.650000000000002,4.0,0.0,0.0
carl bernstein: donald trump is a fascist strongman and a pathological liar (video),"carl bernstein, the legendary journalist who is most famous for his original coverage of the watergate scandal, had some strong words for donald trump sunday morning. bernstein appeared on cnn s reliable sources to discuss trumps campaign s media blackballing of several major news outlets.trump has refused to give media passes to several major publishers from politico to the washington post, where bernstein worked for most of his career.the panel featured in the segment was made up of current editors from a few of the media organizations that trump has put a wall up between them and his campaign. they wasted no time lamenting how hard it has been to deliver news coverage of trump s campaign and expressed worry for the media under a trump administration, given his blatant disregard for first amendment rights.it was bernstein though who had the most critical things to say about trump and his campaign. really, this is about a candidate for president of the united states who does not believe in a free press, said bernstein. he keeps talking about changing libel laws and suing the press and has instituted many, many lawsuits throughout his career. the underlying story here is who is donald trump? and i will say, and have said, that we are seeing the nominee of a major political party for the first time in our history, who is a neofascist, a particular kind of neofascist a strongman who doesn t believe in democratic institutions. bernstein suggests that there is not enough reporting and analysis of trump in the media that shows that accurately puts trump into the context of elections historically. his bigotry is evident and we need to keep looking at it, but this is a story of a candidate who is a total break in our history and we need to be doing reporting on it, not just debating it on television. you can watch the panel discussion below.featured image from video screenshot",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.264615384615386,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0
house democrats seek probe of fcc chairman's treatment of sinclair,"washington (reuters) - two u.s. house democrats on monday asked the federal communications commission inspector general to probe whether fcc chairman ajit pai was biased in favor of sinclair broadcast group, which is seeking approval of a $3.9 billion acquisition of tribune media co. representatives frank pallone and elijah cummings cited fcc decisions that benefited sinclair, the largest u.s. television broadcast group, and a media report last year that the election campaign of president donald trump struck a deal with sinclair for favorable coverage. “all of these actions – when taken in context with reported meetings between the trump administration, sinclair, and chairman pai’s office – have raised serious concerns about whether chairman pai’s actions comply with the fcc’s mandate to be independent,” the pair wrote. advocacy group free press said in an fcc filing in august that sinclair forces its stations to “air pro-trump propaganda and then seeks favors from the trump administration.” a spokeswoman for pai said the “request appears to be part of many democrats’ attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views ... any claim that chairman pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless.” politico, citing unnamed sources, reported in december that trump’s campaign made a deal with sinclair to get favorable coverage in exchange for more access to trump. sinclair did not respond to a request for comment on monday. fcc commissioner jessica rosenworcel, a democrat, told a congressional committee last month, “all of our media policy decisions seem to be custom-built for this one company.” sinclair announced plans in may to acquire tribune’s 42 tv stations in 33 markets as well as cable network wgn america, extending its reach to 72 percent of american households. the fcc is set to vote thursday on pai’s plan to eliminate the ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and tv station in a major market and make it easier for media companies to buy additional tv stations in the same market. approval would make it easier for sinclair to acquire more tv stations. the fcc will also vote thursday on pai’s proposal to allow broadcasters to use new technology to improve picture quality and allow better reception on mobile phones, but it could force consumers to eventually buy new equipment. sinclair holds some patents for the tv technology and rosenworcel said sinclair and others could profit.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,12.0,0.0,0.0

anti-trump u.s. coalition tells u.n. climate talks: 'we're still in',"bonn (reuters) - a coalition of u.s. cities, companies and other groups said on thursday that many in the united states remained committed to the 2015 paris climate agreement despite plans by u.s. president donald trump to pull out. the we are still in coalition opened a 2,500-square meter (27,000-square foot) tent pavilion outside a venue in bonn, germany, where delegates from almost 200 nations are working on details of the pact aimed at ending the fossil fuel era by 2100. by contrast, the u.s. government delegation office at the talks covers only 100 square meters. there is a tradition of non-partisanship for protecting our planet, said james brainard, republican mayor of the town of carmel, indiana, at an opening event. it is unfortunate we have moved away from it. trump, who doubts mainstream scientific findings that global warming is primarily caused by man-made greenhouse gases, said in june he would pull out of the paris agreement and promote the u.s. coal and oil industries. the we are still in coalition of states, cities, universities, faith groups and environmental activists, aims to show delegates from other nations at the nov. 6-17 u.n. talks that many americans are working to cut greenhouse gas emissions. it says its signatories represent more than 130 million americans and $6.2 trillion of annual economic output. fiji, which is presiding at the u.n. talks, welcomed the coalition as a perfect example of how the paris accord aims to widen action beyond national governments. i am confident that coalitions like yours will scale up because they are noble and inspiring, inia seruiratu, the fijian minister for agriculture and disaster management, told the meeting. and jeff moe, director of product advocacy for ingersoll-rand(ir.n), said the company was seeking to halve its greenhouse gas emissions. the we are still in pavilion is funded by bloomberg philanthropies, the hewlett foundation and nextgen america. california governor jerry brown also urged more action on climate change. relative to the threat, the urgency is not there ... and nobody is in charge. that s the biggest problem, he told a news conference in brussels. brown travels to bonn on saturday.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,4.060000000000002,6.0,0.0,0.0

what does it take to bring hillary clinton to justice?,"what does it take to bring hillary clinton to justice? by pepe escobar rt "" - virtually the whole planet holds its collective breath at the prospect of hillary clinton possibly becoming the next president of the united states (potus). hows that humanly possible, as the (daily) bonfire of the scandals  relentlessly fed by wikileaks revelations and now converging fbi investigations - can now be seen from interstellar space? its possible because hillary clinton, slouching through a paroxysm of manufactured hysteria, is supported by virtually the whole us establishment, a consensual neocon/neoliberalcon war party/wall street/corporate media axis. but history has a tendency to show us theres always a straw that breaks the camels back. this could be it  as revealed by wikileaks ; march 2, 2015, the day when john podesta wrote, we are going to have to dump all those emails. that happened to be the exact same day it was revealed hillary clinton had used a personal email server as secretary of state. yet this reveals only part of the puzzle. theres got to be a response to podestas email  which wikileaks may, or may not, leak in the next few days before the election. if the back and forth clearly shows intent (to mislead), then weve got a 100 percent smoking gun: the whole clinton (cash) machine narrative  according to which hillary just deleted ""personal"" emails  crumbles like the ultimate house of cards. moreover, that would unveil what was from the start the privileged clinton machine strategy: to thwart the subsequent internal state dept. and fbi investigations. as far as the clinton machine is concerned, an interlocking influence peddling pile up is the norm. john podesta also happens to be the founder of the center for american progress  a george soros operation and prime recruiting ground for obama administration officials, including us treasury operatives who decided which elite too big to fail (tbtf) financial giants would be spared after the 2008 crisis. dcleaks.com , for its part, has connected soros open society foundations to global funding rackets directly leading to subversion of governments and outright regime change (obviously sparing clinton foundation donors.) exceptional bananas, anyone? the perfectly timed slow drip of wikileaks revelations, for the clinton machine, feels like a sophisticated form of chinese torture. to alleviate the pain, the relentless standard spin has been to change the subject, blame the messenger, and attribute it all to evil russian hacking when the real source for the leaks might have come straight from the belly of the (washington) beast. at the valdai discussion club last week, it took president putin only a few sentences to debunk the whole clinton machine narrative with a bang: another mythical and imaginary problem is what i can only call the hysteria the usa has whipped up over supposed russian meddling in the american presidential election. the united states has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.you would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth. i have to ask myself and ask you too: does anyone seriously imagine that russia can somehow influence the american peoples choice? america is not some kind of banana republic, after all, but is a great power. do correct me if i am wrong. reality, though, continues to insist on offering multiple, overlapping banana republic instances, configuring a giant black hole of transparency. anthropologist janine wedel has been one of the few in clinton-linked us mainstream media acknowledging how bill clinton, while hillary was secretary of state, perfected his version of philantro-capitalism (actually a money laundering pay to play racket), a practice by no means confined to the clintons. and the racket prospered with inbuilt nuggets, such as hillary being perfectly aware that prime clinton foundation donors qatar and saudi arabia were also financing isis/isil/daesh. huma, the fall princess now, less than a week before the election, we have come to the crucial juncture where the wikileaks revelations are merging with the fbi investigations - all three of them. exhibit a is this wikileaks bombshell ; peter kadzik, whos now in charge of the department of justice (doj) probe into the 650,000 emails found on the laptop shared by clintons right-hand woman huma abedin and her estranged, pervert husband anthony wiener, is a clinton asset. not only kadzik was an attorney for marc rich when he was pardoned by bill clinton; podesta  as also revealed by wikileaks - thanked kadzik for keeping him out of jail ; and it was kadzik who gave podesta a secret heads up on the clinton email investigation. the clinton machine, starring a self-described virtuous madonna, is actually a pretty nasty business. huma and her familys close connections to saudi arabia  and the muslim brotherhood  are legendary (that includes her brother hassan, who works for sheikh yusuf al-qaradawi). podesta, by the way, is a handsomely remunerated lobbyist for saudi arabia in washington; thats part of the clinton foundation connection. yet now, with huma in the spotlight  still maintaining she didnt know all those emails were in her and wieners laptop - its no wonder hillary has instantly downgraded her, publicly, to one of my aides . she used to be hillarys ersatz daughter ; now shes being framed as the fall princess. and that brings us to the intersection of those three fbi investigations; on hillarys subterranean email server (in theory closed by fbis comey last summer); on the clinton foundation; and on wieners sexting of minors. the fbi has been investigating the clinton foundation for over a year now. lets try to cut a long story short. follow the evidence last july, the doj  under clinton/obama asset loretta lynch - decided not to prosecute anyone on emailgate. and yet fbi director comey  who nonetheless stressed hillarys extreme carelessness  turbo-charged his no-denial mode on another investigation, as in the fbi sought to refocus the clinton foundation probe. soon we had clinton foundation fbi investigators trying to get access to all the emails turned over in the emailgate investigation. the east district of new york refused it. very important point; up to 2015, guess who was the us attorney at the east district; clinton/obama asset lynch. enter an extra layer of legalese. less than two months ago, the clinton foundation fbi investigators discovered they could not have access to any emailgate material that was connected to immunity agreements. but then, roughly a month ago, another fbi team captured the by now famous laptop shared by huma and wiener - using a warrant allowing only a probe on weiners sexting of a 15-year-old girl. subsequently they found huma abedin emails at all her accounts  from humaabedin@yahoo.com to the crucial huma@clintonemail.com . this meant not only that huma was forwarding state dept. emails to her private accounts, but also that hillary was sending emails from the secret clintonemail.com to huma at yahoo.com. no one knew for sure, but some of these emails might be duplicates of those the clinton foundation fbi investigators could not access because of the pesky immunity agreements. whats established by now is that the metadata in the huma/wiener laptop was duly examined. now picture both teams of fbi investigators  clinton foundation and pervert wiener  comparing notes. and then they decide humas emails are relevant. key questions apply; and the most pressing is how the emails were deemed relevant if the investigators could only examine the metadata. what matters is that comey certainly was made aware of the content of the emails  a potential game-changer. thats why one of my sources insists his decision to go public came from above. the other key question now is whether the doj  via kadzik? - will once again thwart another investigation, this time on the clinton foundation. senior, serious fbi agents wont take that  massive euphemism  kindly. the fbi has been on the clinton foundation for over a year. now, arguably, they are loaded with evidence  and they wont quit. winning the presidency now seems to be the least of hillary clintons bonfire of scandals problems. pepe escobar is an independent geopolitical analyst. he writes for rt, sputnik and tomdispatch, and is a frequent contributor to websites and radio and tv shows ranging from the us to east asia. he is the former roving correspondent for asia times online. born in brazil, he's been a foreign correspondent since 1985, and has lived in london, paris, milan, los angeles, washington, bangkok and hong kong.",1,10,0.0,0,1,0,0.09090909090909091,4.830000000000002,8.0,0.0,0.0
european commission says 'ball still rolling' on trade deal with u.s.,"brussels (reuters) - the european union’s executive said on monday it had a unanimous mandate from the bloc’s 28 members to finalize negotiations on a free trade deal with the united states, a day after germany’s economy minister said the talks had “de facto failed”. sigmar gabriel of germany, the eu’s biggest economy, said on sunday that negotiations over the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (ttip) had failed because europe rejected some u.s. demands. asked to comment on gabriel’s remarks, a european commission spokesman said: “the ball is still rolling” on ttip. “although trade talks take time, the ball is rolling right now and the commission is making steady progress in the ongoing ttip negotiations,” margaritis schinas told a news conference. the white house also disputed gabriel’s contention, saying it was still aiming to reach a deal by the end of the year. “it’s going to require the resolution of some pretty thorny negotiations, but the president and his team are committed to doing that,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters in washington. in berlin, germany’s leading industry associations were critical of gabriel’s remarks and urged the german government to show greater commitment to free trade deals. the head of industry association bdi, ulrich grillo, said it was “astonishing” that gabriel, who is also vice chancellor and head of the co-governing social democrats, had declared the ttip talks a failure when negotiations were still going on. top officials of other industry associations such as vdma and the auto industry association vda also spoke out against gabriel’s comments, which highlighted growing divisions within chancellor angela merkel’s ruling coalition ahead of next year’s elections. three years of negotiations have failed to resolve multiple differences, including over food and environmental safety, with critics saying the pact would hand too much power to big multinationals at the expense of consumers and workers. backers of a sweeping u.s.-eu free trade deal see it bringing economic gains on both sides of the atlantic. eu trade ministers will discuss the issue in bratislava on sept. 22. schinas said the commission was still ready to finalize the deal by the end of the year but not at the expense of “europe’s safety, health, social and data protection standards, or our cultural diversity”. commenting separately on gabriel’s remarks, lithuanian foreign minister linas linkevicius said he believed arriving at a deal would benefit both the eu and the united states. “it would be better for all sides to agree,” he said. “of course, not at an expense of our interests. we have to defend our interests, but we also have to negotiate and conclude this agreement. it would be a big boost for economies, jobs, trade.” britain’s june vote to leave the eu has further clouded the picture, although schinas said brussels was still negotiating on behalf of all 28 members of the bloc, including london.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.936363636363637,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
supporters of hungarian jobbik opposition party protest over crackdown,"budapest (reuters) - about a thousand hungarians protested on friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party jobbik which has been threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a death sentence for democracy. despite the gloomy rhetoric and jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. hungarians will vote for a new parliament in april and prime minister viktor orban s conservative, anti-migrant fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with jobbik its nearest rival. jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is an open book . last week the state audit office (asz) ruled jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. the protesters, waving jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of orban s fidesz party. what we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. it is not an official penalty. this is a death sentence with jobbik s name on it. but in reality, it is a death sentence for hungarian democracy, jobbiik leader gabor vona told the crowd. a government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. asz chairman laszlo domokos is a former fidesz lawmaker, whom jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of orban. the audit office denies that. on friday, asz again called on jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. the ruling fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the asz probe. this case has nothing to do with the election campaign, orban aide janos lazar said on thursday. for over a year fidesz has targeted jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst zoltan novak at the centre for fair political analysis. gyorgy illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions. this asz probe is a clear sign that orban is way past any remedy. it is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it, he said.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,16.764444444444447,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0
"back on her feet at 85, thanks to a chair - the new york times","in the middle of marilyn oshman’s otherwise cozy apartment on the lower east side of manhattan, between an antique candelabra, curtains and framed family photos, was a hospital bed. “i was dying,” mrs. oshman, 85, said. “i felt like i was in a prison in that lousy hospital bed. i couldn’t get out. ” she was bedridden and unable to walk because of venous stasis and cellulitis, a painful bacterial infection that covered the lower half of her body with large, sores. ordinary tasks, like getting out of bed every morning, became impossible. it was a drastic setback for someone who loved to move around on her own. as a child born and raised on monroe street on the lower east side, she loved exploring the city by foot. when she was 20, she had a job at a toy factory on broadway, and it was there that she met her husband, david oshman. they divorced in the late 1980s after 35 years of marriage, but mrs. oshman recounted fond memories of their active, early years together: dancing the jitterbug on fridays and sundays at a club on the lower east side (“and he was some jitterbug dancer!” she said) fishing for pogies off a coney island pier and when they had children, a son and a daughter, taking family vacations to the mountains. most of all, though, she said she loved doing the simpler things around the house: washing the walls, scrubbing the floors and cooking her favorite jewish delicacies, stuffed cabbage and pot roast. but her health took a bad turn around 50 and deteriorated over the last three decades. for the last two years, mrs. oshman has made many trips between mount sinai beth israel hospital at 16th street and first avenue, and gouverneur health on the lower east side, and then back to her apartment. “two years of hell,” she said. “and i mean hell. ” the back and forth became so strenuous that her doctor helped mrs. oshman get a hospital bed — not the centerpiece she would have preferred — so that she could receive medical care in her apartment. she was home, but she was miserable she could not lie comfortably in the new bed and often resorted to sleeping upright in a wheelchair. the ordeal became a dangerous cycle: she struggled to stand on her own, meaning she spent more time bedridden and immobile, which intensified the swelling, redness and pain. “i don’t want money, i don’t want jewelry,” mrs. oshman said, glancing at her still swollen legs, wrapped in compression socks. she added, through tears: “the only thing i want, at this stage in my life, is to be able to walk again. ” over the summer, mrs. oshman’s doctor recommended a special recliner that could help her stand up, but mrs. oshman could not afford it. every month she receives $1, 251 in social security benefits and $180 in food stamps, which is not enough to cover her monthly grocery bills. she pays $406 a month to medicaid for the home care services, and $350 monthly toward her apartment. she was 62 when she retired from citibank, where she was a greeter and an assistant to bankers, after she got too sick to continue working. mrs. oshman left with no retirement savings and does not receive financial support from her children. she has been getting help from the educational alliance, an organization that offers a social service program for people over 60. the educational alliance is a beneficiary agency of of new york, one of the eight organizations supported by the new york times neediest cases fund. when the alliance learned of mrs. oshman’s need for the recliner, the group used $799 from the neediest funds to buy it. it arrived in august. “this chair saved my life, and i’m not kidding when i tell you that,” mrs. oshman said. “i was suffering with the hospital bed, and because of this chair, i’m able to walk again. it’s a blessing. i’m doing more for myself than i ever did. i’m changing myself. ” she has had to relearn tasks once taken for granted: standing up on her own, dressing herself and getting into the kitchen. “i’m living since i got this chair,” she said, tilting it up and down. it even has a massage function and heated seats. “what should we name it?” she asked, referring to the chair draped in a bright purple sheet and blanket. mrs. oshman has been able to get out of the apartment more in recent months than she ever did during the last few years. she is again walking the streets of the lower east side, where she grew up. “i was a familiar face around the neighborhood then, and until this day, i still am,” she said. “i was away from here for two years, and when the aide took me downstairs one day recently, people stopped me in the street saying, ‘what happened to you? where were you?’ and all i said was, ‘i’m back. ’”",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0625,1.6700000000000017,5.6000000000000005,0.0,0.0
five women donald trump allegedly slept with and how they utterly humiliated him,"donald trump obviously has a knack for purchasing beautiful women. his first wife, ivana, was a model from the czech republic who was famous for gaudy accessories and over-spending. trump cheated on her and eventually married marla maples, who may have actually loved him for some reason but grew tired of him and moved on with a good chunk of his money. his current wife, melania, is yet another eastern european model who loves the lavish lifestyle he provides for her.in between the women who have allowed him to buy them, after the millions of dollars in divorce costs, trump has always declared himself something of a ladies man. he and his ahem giant hands have been telling stories of his conquests for decades. the problem is, just like everything else about trump, the stories are mostly exaggerations, outright lies or rumors that he enjoyed a little bit too much to dispel in good conscience like a decent human being. go figure. here s a list of five of the famous women donald trump has lied about dating and how they humiliated him when they had made his list:the former olympic champion ice-skater was 41-years-old and happily married when her supposed affair with the donald happened. after the new york daily news reported her as a possible trump fling, she felt she needed to respond since trump decided not to dispel the rumor: the reason i m going public with my outrage over this allegation is that i had hoped that donald trump would issue his own statement of the rumor being completely unfounded, and that has not happened quickly enough, she said. i ve been around donald trump four times in my life. i wouldn t even call him a good friend. ouch. even though that happened in 1990, you just know it still stings the orange man s ego.the dynasty star who played princess diana in two tv movies told people that there was no truth at all to the rumors she and trump were an item. again trump remained silent, allowing himself to be associated with yet another beautiful woman far out of his league: [he s] a complete joke as far as i m concerned. i hardly know the man, oxenburg told people in 1990.and another one down. no wonder he allowed his actual affair with maples to go public. his reputation was taking a severe beating.the cosmetics mogul refused to give any credence to the rumor she and trump were a thing, dispelling it with a simple i don t know what you re talking about, when asked by people. trump never attempted to call her out, because the rumors he allowed to continue were obviously not true.the prominent swimsuit model and wife of nhl star ron greschner never bothered to answer the allegations she was into trump. she allowed her manager, steve gutstein, to do it for her instead: donald trump is a fortunate man, but he s not that fortunate. that s another one that had to just hurt. trump could very well have avoided all of the humiliation by telling the truth about these rumors when they happened or by not starting them if he was the source but he instead rode the wave of ignorance that has carried him towards the republican nomination 26 years later.the socialite and designer who was married to trump s billionaire acquaintance henry kravitz (it s a well-established fact that trump doesn t have friends), said the rumors were ridiculous. she added, i m married to the greatest man in the world. those are words trump has probably heard quite often himself after he buys something extravagant.to his credit, there was one rumor trump decided to debunk on his own. in the prime of mike tyson s career, trump was accused of a fling with robin givens. it s not too difficult to figure out why. featured image from getty images, modified",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.15384615384615385,11.264615384615386,14.430769230769233,0.0,0.0
5 reasons why you should never use dryer sheets again,"share on facebook most commercial dryer sheets are loaded with all sorts of toxic chemicals including benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, chloroform and linalool; none of which are good for your health. in addition to all the chemicals that end up on your skin, when heated, the fumes are also toxic. these toxins go straight to their brain's most sensitive neurological centers and wreck havoc. 5 killer reasons to ditch dryer sheets artificial fragrances when people use dryer sheets, they are coating their clothes with artificial chemical perfumes. these fragrance chemicals are extremely toxic. they are known carcinogens that cause liver damage and cancer in mammals. in a recent study performed by uw professor dr. anne steinemann, a research team conducted a small study to understand the effects of fragrances in laundry products (both detergent and dryer sheets). the results discovered more than 25 vocs emitted from dryer vents, with highest concentrations of acetaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol (two of which are considered carcinogenic). to put it into context, one of the carcinogenic vocs, acetaldehyde, had emissions that would represent 3% of total acetaldehyde emissions from automobiles in the study area. this is a major omission of toxic chemicals. according to the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and industry-generated material safety data sheets (msds) from the 1990s, the following is a list of chemicals in fabric softener products, most in untested combinations. 1. alpha-terpineol–this chemical has been linked to disorders of the brain and nervous system, loss of muscle control, depression, and headaches. 2. benzyl acetate–benzyl acetate has been linked to cancer of the pancreas. 3. benzyl alcohol–this upper respiratory tract irritant can cause central nervous system (cns) disorders, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and dramatic drops in blood pressure. 4. chloroform–neurotoxic, anesthetic and carcinogenic. really toxic to your brain. inhaling its vapors may cause loss of consciousness, nausea, headache, vomiting, and/or dizziness, drowsiness. 5. ethanol– another fabric softener ingredient which is on the epa's hazardous waste list and linked to cns disorders. 6. ethyl acetate–causes headaches and is on the epa hazardous waste list. 7. linalool–in studies, this chemical caused loss of muscle coordination, nervous system and brain disorders, and depression. 8. pentane–causes headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, and depression. what's the alternative to toxic dryer sheets? wool balls. they are 100% natural and are effective at getting rid of static cling and wrinkles, soften clothes.",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.1,4.830000000000002,4.0,0.0,0.0
"trump is fuming over bad charlottesville press, becomes a terror in the white house (tweet)","once again, donald trump is having a completely disappointing, inappropriate reaction to the racially motivated violence that happened in charlottesville, virginia last weekend.apparently, instead of being outraged about the murder of one counter protester and the injuries of several others, trump is all bent out of shape because he has gotten a lot of negative press coverage for his weak, pathetic response to the incident. according to white house officials, trump is coming apart at the seams over this, as robert costa reported: person close to kelly framed it to me this way: potus fuming at press, coverage of c ville handling. in no mood for talk about moderation. seriously, what did trump expect to happen after he ignored america s pleas to denounce the violence for two whole days, before issuing a scripted, half-ass statement on monday? not even the white supremacists trump targeted in his response believed that he was actually denouncing racism.if trump wanted positive press coverage, he should have actually done his job and condemned the white supremacist values and bigotry from the start. speaking up against racism and the violence that broke out of that white nationalist rally was possibly the easiest task a president could ask for, and trump failed miserably at executing that. instead, trump protected and defended the racist attackers, making his approval rating only plummet further and giving the media even more things to criticize.trump can blame the media all he wants, but it is his own lack of competency that is responsible for his failure as president. he never does the right thing, even when it is blatantly obvious what actions he should be taking. what happened in charlottesville was an opportunity for trump to emerge as a different president than most americans expect him to be, and he completely blew it. there is something very wrong when a leader cares more about his press coverage than the lives of his constituents.featured image via branden camp / getty images",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.780000000000001,8.666666666666668,0.06666666666666667,0.0

"eying snap election, japan's abe to focus on education, security","tokyo (reuters) - pledges to spend on education and child care, stay tough on north korea and revise the pacifist constitution are likely to be pillars of japanese prime minister shinzo abe s campaign in a snap election next month, government sources said on tuesday. abe is expected to announce on monday that he will call a general election on oct. 22 to take advantage of a rebound in his damaged approval ratings and disarray in the opposition, ruling party and government sources said. the prime minister, whose ratings have recovered from below 30 percent in july, is betting his ruling bloc can at a minimum retain a simple majority in the chamber and at best keep the two-thirds super-majority needed to achieve his long-held goal of revising the constitution to clarify the military s role. a solid victory would boost abe s chances of a third term as ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) leader in a party election next september, putting him on track to become japan s longest-serving premier. that is his biggest goal, said veteran independent political analyst minoru morita. abe s support rose 6.5 points to 50.3 percent in a poll conducted over the weekend by the sankei newspaper and the fuji news network, while backing for the ldp was at 38 percent compared to 6.4 percent for the main opposition democratic party. abe wants to go ahead with a planned rise in the nation s sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent and use some of the revenue to create a social security system for all generations , which would invest in education while decreasing the proportion of sales tax revenue used to pay down government debt, the sources said. japan s social welfare system is weighted toward spending on the elderly, with people aged 65 and over accounting for a whopping 27.7 percent of the population according to the latest government data. you can promise anything you want - make a nod toward a more equitable society, empowering women, work-life balance, welfare for all generations, said jeffrey kingston, director of asian studies at temple university japan. he s got a strategy that is going to win. using less tax revenue to pay down debt, however, would make more difficult an already ambitious pledge to balance the budget - excluding debt-servicing and new bond sales - by the year through march 2021. that could in turn raise concerns about less rigid fiscal discipline. we have to maintain fiscal discipline, regardless, finance minister taro aso told reporters when asked about reports of such a shift. abe has said he will decide on a snap election after he returns from the united states on friday. the opposition democrats are struggling not only with single-digit support but also a raft of defections. and while the nascent japan first party, which boasts ties to popular tokyo governor yuriko koike, could attract votes, it has yet to draft a platform, pick candidates or formally register as a party. that means the ldp and its junior coalition partner, the komeito, have a shot at retaining their two-thirds majority in the lower house, political analysts said. however, some analysts believe abe s electoral base could be undermined by voter distaste over suspected cronyism scandals and concerns about creating a political vacuum even as north korea raises tensions with its nuclear and missile tests. i don t dismiss the possibility of the voters giving abe a nasty surprise, said gerry curtis, professor emeritus at columbia university in new york.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.09,16.0,0.0,0.0
trump booster apologizes for clinton 'blackface' tweet,"washington (reuters) - pastor marks burns, a prominent supporter of republican presidential nominee donald trump, apologized on tuesday for sending out a tweet that showed a cartoon image of democratic nominee hillary clinton in blackface. burns, an african-american who is frequently one of the warmup speakers at trump rallies, sent out the tweet on monday to bolster the trump campaign’s contention that clinton is pandering for the black vote but will ignore the community if elected on nov. 8. “i ain’t no ways pandering to african americans,” the cartoon image says. the tweet emerged at a time when trump has been trying to broaden his appeal to african-american voters by saying he wants to create more jobs and make black neighborhoods safe so people can walk down the street without getting shot. after burns began taking fire for the tweet, he deleted it and apologized for the image but not his message. “i’m so sorry for the offensive #blackface image of @hillaryclinton but stand by the message that we blacks are being used by #dems for votes,” burns said.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.740000000000002,8.514285714285714,0.0,0.0

financial adviser sentenced to four years for bilking nba's tim duncan,"san antonio (reuters) - a wine industry businessman and financial manager was sentenced to four years in prison on wednesday for defrauding millions of dollars from former national basketball association star tim duncan. charles banks, 49, had faced up to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty in april to one count of wire fraud regarding an investment he urged duncan to make in a firm called gameday entertainment, which banks headed. u.s. district judge fred biery also ordered banks pay $7.5 million to duncan in restitution. san antonio spurs great duncan, who is now retired, said in a statement he was afraid that without a strong sentence, financial advisers would feel they were free to prey on young, impressionable and suddenly wealthy athletes. “judge biery, you may not understand how difficult it is for me to be in the public light in this horrible way, as the poster child for a dumb athlete whose financial advisor took his money,” duncan said in a statement read into the court record by prosecutors. “i hate it and am embarrassed by it more than you can imagine.” several nba players were in the courtroom to support duncan, including former teammates tony parker and manu ginobili. after the hearing, duncan told reporters he was satisfied with the sentence. in a brief statement before sentencing, banks apologized to duncan for “breaking his trust,” by tricking him into agreeing to make loans to a failing sports merchandise company headed by banks. according to court documents, duncan’s losses totaled $13.5 million in investments and loan guarantees made to gameday, which went out of business this year. prosecutors said much of that money went into banks’ pockets.defense lawyers said in court in april that some of that money has been forgiven by the banks that provided the original loans. banks is also the founder of terroir capital, a financial management fund that works in the wine and hospitality industry. duncan retired at the end of last season after 19 seasons with the spurs. the scam was discovered when duncan’s divorce lawyer consulted a financial planner to put together a property settlement for the basketball star’s divorce, court documents said.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0

letters from jacqueline kennedy to the man she didn’t marry - the new york times,"london — in november 1967, four years after her husband’s assassination, jacqueline kennedy traveled to the temples of angkor wat in cambodia on a trip with david ormsby gore, a friend of her husband and himself a recent widower. there was much speculation of a romantic attachment. a few months later, mr. ormsby gore, a former british ambassador to washington, proposed marriage. she turned him down. in a handwritten letter, filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty, she explained her decision to marry aristotle onassis instead. “if ever i can find some healing and some comfort — it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain,” she wrote. “i can find that now — if the world will let us. ” the letter was part of a set of papers found in locked cases discovered only last month in wales at the family home of mr. ormsby gore, who died in 1985. they are being auctioned in london next month by his grandson to help restore the house. the letters point to the depth of feeling behind the public mask of one of the most celebrated women of her time. among them is the letter to mr. ormsby gore, also known as lord harlech, dated nov. 13, 1968, a month after her marriage to mr. onassis and five months after the assassination of robert f. kennedy. in it, mrs. kennedy spoke of the love and bond she felt for mr. ormsby gore, whose wife had died in a car crash in may 1967. “we have known so much shared lost so much together — even if it isn’t the way you wish now — i hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut. ” writing from mr. onassis’ yacht in greece, on stationery with the ship’s crest, a clear if cold message, mrs. kennedy told mr. ormsby gore: “you are like my beloved beloved brother — and mentor — and the only original spirit i know — as you were to jack. ” mr. ormsby gore had expressed incredulity at her choice of mr. onassis, and she tried to respond. “please know — you of all people must know it — that we can never really see into the heart of another,” she wrote. “you know me. and you must know that the man you write of in your letter is not a man that i could marry. ” mr. onassis, she wrote, is “lonely and wants to protect me from being lonely. and he is wise and kind. only i can decide if he can, and i decided. “i know it comes as a surprise to so many people,” she continued. “but they see things for me that i never wanted for myself. ” mr. ormsby gore was an old friend of john f. kennedy, whose younger sister kathleen, or kick, married mr. ormsby gore’s first cousin. after the election of the young president in 1960, prime minister harold macmillan sent mr. ormsby gore to washington as britain’s ambassador. the two men, a year apart in age, were extremely close, and president kennedy consulted with him on every key issue of foreign policy, especially during the 1962 cuban missile crisis, and in discussions of vietnam and nuclear disarmament. robert kennedy said that mr. ormsby gore was “almost a part of the government,” adding that the president “would rather have his judgment than that of anybody else. ” among the letters is one in which president kennedy praised the ambassador: “i appreciate as you know, in all these critical matters your judgment — which i have found to be uniformly good and true. ” mr. ormsby gore inherited the noble title, lord harlech, when his father died in 1964. his grandson jasset, who inherited the title a year ago, is the one selling the papers, along with other possessions, at bonhams, london, in an auction scheduled for march 29. some of the letters will be on view on march 2 in new york at the bonhams showroom, at 580 madison avenue. in total, there are 18 handwritten letters and one typed letter from mrs. kennedy to mr. ormsby gore, as well as other papers. those include a pass admitting him to the white house on nov. 23, 1963, one day after the assassination a jocular 1963 letter from robert kennedy, signed “bobby” and instructions for pallbearers for robert kennedy’s funeral. the papers also include a letter mrs. kennedy wrote to mr. ormsby gore after the death of his wife, sylvia, known as sissie, which seemed to foreshadow his desire to marry her. “your last letter was such a cri de coeur of loneliness — i would do anything to take that anguish from you,” she wrote. “you want to patch the wounds match the loose pairs — but you can’t because your life won’t turn out that way. ” one of the most moving documents is a draft letter mr. ormsby gore wrote to mrs. kennedy after she turned down his proposal. “all the pathetic plans i had brought with me for visits to cyrenaica, holidays near one another and a whole variety of solutions to our marriage problem, including one for a secret marriage this summer — plans which i saw us eagerly discussing, calmly and with complete frankness as we did at the cape and in cambodia for the next wonderful ten days — all had become irrelevant trash to be thrown away within a few hours of my landing in new york,” he wrote. “as for your photograph i weep when i look at it. why do such agonizing things have to happen? where was the need for it?” the kennedys and the ormsby gores socialized frequently, even stirring resentment among other diplomats and members of the administration. there were small dinners at the white house and shared vacations. one “incoherent letter as written on martini” from mrs. kennedy, in the spring of 1962, discusses their coming vacation at the america’s cup races. others mention her love of dance. matthew haley, the head of fine books and manuscripts at bonhams, said that “you just don’t get this quantity of insight into jackie’s personal life and that level of intimacy. ” mr. ormsby gore was her husband’s great friend, but “the fact that they developed such an intimate friendship in such a short space of time is important,” he said, even if built on shared sadness. contacted about the letters on friday, a representative of the kennedy family said that they had decided not to comment. barbara leaming, who has written biographies of president and mrs. kennedy, said that mr. ormsby gore was “the pivotal relationship jack had in the presidency,” a man he trusted almost as much as robert kennedy. “jackie loved in jack the man he wanted to be, and david was the man helping him, in her eyes, to be the man jack wanted to be,” she said. the distress that followed robert kennedy’s assassination in june 1968 was one reason she turned to the security of mr. onassis, ms. leaming said. “it was the second great trauma for her,” ms. leaming said. “she was very clear it was not a marriage of love, as she said to joe alsop in a letter. she was seeking safety. ” as for mr. ormsby gore, “of course he fell in love with her — she understood him so well,” ms. leaming said. “but i have no idea if it was consummated or not. ” mr. ormsby gore did marry again, in december 1969, to pamela colin, an american who bore more than a passing resemblance to mrs. onassis. he died in 1985, at 66, after a car crash. mrs. onassis attended his funeral.",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0625,7.570000000000004,11.314285714285715,0.0,0.0
"facing long odds in california, cruz courts state's republicans","burlingame, calif. (reuters) - u.s. presidential candidate ted cruz made a plea to the california republican party on saturday to line up behind him in the state’s june primary in his uphill battle to stop front-runner donald trump from grabbing the nomination. at the same party convention that was the backdrop for chaotic protests against trump on friday, cruz tried to woo party members with support for their long-time issues, such as lower taxes and a harder line on immigration. former california governor pete wilson gave cruz his endorsement as he introduced the senator from texas. cruz received more applause at the convention than either trump or third-place candidate ohio governor john kasich, who also spoke on friday. “if we’re fractured and we’re divided, hillary clinton wins and the campaign is lost,” he said, referring to the democratic party’s front-runner in the nov. 8 election for the white house. now mathematically eliminated from securing the nomination on the first ballot at the party’s convention in cleveland in july, cruz aims to stop trump from receiving the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, forcing a contested convention. however, the prospect of him being able to do so has grown increasingly slim. trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality tv star, has continued to notch up wins in the nation’s nominating contests, including a five-state sweep of the latest string of contests last tuesday. cruz has downplayed the severity of the losses and in his speech saturday looked forward to upcoming contests, which he has said will put him on the path to thwarting trump. “california is going to decide this republican primary,” he said, referring to the state’s june 7 contest. trump has been at odds with the party’s establishment and has called the system for nominating its candidate “rigged.” critics say he has played on the fears of his supporters, especially about immigration, by proposing a temporary ban on muslims entering the country and accusing illegal mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals. on thursday and friday, anti-trump protests erupted outside the candidate’s california events. on friday, he was forced to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to a hotel to give a speech to the convention and avoid several hundred loud protesters gathered outside. cruz hopes to slow trump’s march toward the nomination in indiana’s primary on tuesday. the state awards its 57 delegates on a winner-take-all basis by congressional district, possibly granting cruz a windfall of pledged delegates. a real clear politics polling aggregation in the state shows cruz just behind trump, 35.2 percent to 37.5 percent. polls show cruz has more of a challenge in delegate-rich california, where he lags trump 28.3 percent to 45.7 percent. in an indication of efforts to court the state, cruz on wednesday made the unusual move of naming a vice presidential running mate, onetime presidential hopeful carly fiorina, who was formerly a chief executive of the california technology company hewlett-packard co. on saturday night, she urged the crowd of party faithful, many of whom had backed her as the party’s nominee in a failed bid for u.s. senate in 2010, to join her in supporting cruz. in a dynamic and combative speech, she urged kasich to get out of the race, and challenged the idea that trump had locked up the nomination. “donald trump was here yesterday and he was telling you it’s over,” fiorina said. “but the 30-yard line ain’t a touchdown.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.89777777777778,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0

construction executives detained in peru in graft probe,"lima (reuters) - four former and current executives of peruvian construction companies were detained pending trial on monday, accused of colluding with brazilian builder odebrecht [odbes.ul] to bribe a former president. judge richard concepcion ordered the men, who deny wrongdoing, to be held in pre-trial jail to ensure they do not flee or obstruct the law, as prosecutors prepare criminal charges. the decision marked the first time executives from major peruvian companies have been jailed in the car wash scandal, brazil s largest-ever corruption probe that has widened to include other latin american countries. odebrecht has admitted to bribing local officials in 12 countries to secure public works contracts over the course of a decade and promised authorities that it would provide details. prosecutor hamilton castro accused jose alejandro grana and hernando alejandro grana, who once headed peru s biggest construction group grana y montero, and fernando gonzalo and jose fernando castillo, who work for two private contractors, of providing $15 million of a $20 million bribe that odebrecht paid. the money was paid to ex-president alejandro toledo to secure highway contracts that the companies partnered together on a decade ago and had been disguised on company books as the cost of additional risks covered by odebrecht, castro said at a court hearing. the judge also ordered gonzalo ferraro, a former grana y montero manager who was in local hospital, to be placed under house arrest. all five men deny any wrongdoing and are appealing the judge s ruling, said ferraro s attorney roger yon. grana y montero, and the two private companies, jjc contratistas generales and ingenieros civiles y contratistas generales, declined to comment. the three companies have previously denied knowing about or taking part in odebrecht s bribes. grana y montero s u.s.-listed shares closed 6.9 percent lower on monday. the corruption probe has shaken up the local construction sector as the government prepares to award nearly $8 billion in contracts for rebuilding infrastructure and housing destroyed by flooding. president pedro pablo kuczynski, who served in toledo s cabinet when the highway contracts were awarded, has said he knew nothing about the alleged bribe for toledo. toledo, ordered to pre-trial detention in february, has denied taking bribes from odebrecht. peru is seeking his extradition from the united states. a second former president, ollanta humala, has been in pre-trial detention since july and denies allegations he took illicit funds from odebrecht.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.655000000000001,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
"watch: trump issues bizarre response to leak of groping audio, and it’s a total disaster (video)","donald trump issued a strange video after midnight on friday night to address the leaked audio of him making crude jokes about sexually assaulting women. the video, released via his facebook page had all the appearance of a hostage video, and the actual content was almost as bad.referencing his comment that he would grab them by the p y and that he was in favor of pushing himself on women and kissing them, trump said, anyone who knows me knows these words don t reflect who i am. i said it, i was wrong, and i apologize. he then went on to say, hillary clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground, and made the allegation that bill clinton has actually abused women. the comments come as condemnations continue to pile up against trump from his fellow republicans, and some have also called for him to completely drop out of the race. senator mark kirk of illinois, stuck in a tight race against democratic rep. tammy duckworth, called for trump to leave the race, as did former new york governor george pataki.other republicans, while not calling for trump to drop out, issued condemnations, including speaker paul ryan (who disinvited him from a joint campaign event), senator ted cruz, senator marco rubio, former governor jeb bush, and senator kelly ayotte, among others.trump was roundly condemned by hillary clinton s campaign, and her spokesperson issued a statement: this is horrific. we cannot allow this man to become president. her running mate, senator tim kaine also responded to trump s remarks: this kind of behavior is disgusting. it makes me sick to my stomach. some reports have indicated that senior officials hastily arranged meetings on friday night to discuss possible scenarios in which trump would be removed from the ticket. but doing so is nearly impossible at this point, and several states that allow early voting have already had ballots cast.this is unquestionably a disaster for the republican party, and trump s crazed, petulant video does not help.featured image via screen capture",1,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.047619047619047616,10.562500000000004,13.9,0.0,0.0
india lobbies trump administration to avert visa threat,"new delhi (reuters) - india has stepped up its lobbying effort against moves in the u. s. congress to impose curbs on visas for skilled workers that threaten the south asian nation’s tech sector, which employs more than 3.5 million people. speaking to reuters, trade minister nirmala sitharaman said new delhi had reached out to the administration of president donald trump to stress the importance of india’s $150-billion it services industry to u.s. citizens. “india’s investments in the united states have provided jobs to u.s. citizens,” she said in an interview. “that has to be brought to the notice of the u.s. administration.” the comments come days after prime minister narendra modi urged washington to keep an open mind on admitting skilled indian workers. indian software companies such as tata consultancy services, infosys ltd and wipro ltd shot to prominence in the 1990s by helping western firms stamp out the “y2k” bug. trump’s “america first” rhetoric on jobs, however, has put their biggest market under threat. a bill was introduced in the u.s. congress last month to more than double the minimum salary of h-1b visa holders, which could significantly boost costs for it companies, whose margins are already being squeezed. new delhi has backed a move by nasscom, india’s high-tech industry association, to lobby u.s. lawmakers and companies to urge the administration not to crack down on allowing its skilled workers into the united states. a nasscom delegation is now in the united states to make its case to officials on capitol hill and in the white house. “we will have to engage with the new administration,” sitharaman said. “our engagement at every level is intact and continuing.” the united states is india’s biggest trading partner, but trade in goods between the two countries has been stagnant, at around $67 billion, for the last three years. indian software exports to the u.s. rose more than 10 percent, to $37 billion, in the last fiscal year from a year earlier. indian nationals are by far the largest group of recipients of the 65,000 h-1b visas issued annually to new applicants under a cap mandated by congress. more than 60 percent of the u.s. employees of infosys hold h-1b visas. a global pact on services trade would go a long way towards settling disputes over professional visas, sitharaman said. “if only there is a framework...you will know how movement can happen and how certain restrictions can or cannot come,” she said. “it’s time for countries to sit together and look at it.”",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.605000000000004,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
the smoking gun: cheryl mills tells podesta “we need to clean this up – obama has emails from her” (video),"by: tyler durden, zero hedge | recall that in a march 2015 interview with cbs, just after the nyt reported of hillary’s use of a private email server, president obama told the american public he had only learned about hillary’s “unusual” arrangement from the press. as we further reminded readers one month ago, cbs news senior white house correspondent bill plante asked mr. obama when he learned about her private email system after his saturday appearance in selma, alabama. “ the same time everybody else learned it through news reports ,” the president told plante. “ the policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the blackberry i carry around, all those records are available and archived ,” mr. obama said. “i’m glad that hillary instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.” unfortunately, the “transparency” of the obama administration was severely tarnished in late september , when in the fbi’s interview notes with huma abedin released by the fbi it was first revealed that obama had used a pseudonymous email account: “once informed that the sender’s name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, abedin exclaimed: ‘how is this not classified?'” the report says. “abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.” to be sure, this was not definitive evidence that obama was aware of hillary’s email server, nor that there may have been collusion between the president and the clinton campaign. that changed today, however, when in the latest podesta dump we learn that in an email from cheryl mills to john podesta , the clinton aide upon learning what obama had just said… … countered with something quite stunning: we need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov that, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the clinton campaign. as a further reminder, politico previously reported that the state department had refused to make public that and other emails clinton exchanged with obama. lawyers cited the “presidential communications privilege,” a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the freedom of information act. it is therefore unknown what the president’s “alternative” email account was, or who hosted it. this also explains why in a prior wikileak, podesta told mills in an email titled “special category” that she thinks “ we should hold emails to and from potus? that’s the heart of his exec privilege. we could get them to ask for that. they may not care, but i(t) seems like they will. ” mills did not respond by email. the clinton-obama emails were turned over to the state department, which later announced it would not release them. * * * so just how did mills and podesta “clean up” the fact that obama lied to the american people, a tactic some could allege is evidence of an attempt to cover up a presidential lie to protect hillary clinton. what we do know, and we assume this is completely unrelated, between march 25-31, just a couple of weeks after mills said “we need to clean this up,” bleachbit was used to wipe hillary’s private server clean. but of course, that is purely a coincidence. since we are confident others will also demand an answer, in light of the latest revelation hinting at a collusive cover up extending to the very top of us government, or as cheryl mills dubbed it a “clean up”, perhaps it is time for the state depratment to unveil just what was said between the president and the clinton campaign? submit your review",1,20,0.0,0,0,0,0.08,9.209473684210526,13.915789473684212,0.0,0.0
leading democrat: critics can't conclude trump is impaired,"washington (reuters) - adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, said on sunday that it was premature to try to remove u.s. president donald trump by claiming he is physically or mentally impaired. schiff told jake tapper on cnn’s “state of the union” program that it did not make sense for trump’s opponents to focus on the 25th amendment to the u.s. constitution, which two democratic lawmakers invoked against the president after his controversial comments about a white nationalist rally in virginia. under the 25th amendment, the vice president takes over as acting president if he and a majority of either cabinet officials or “such other body as congress may by law provide” declare in writing that the president “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” “i think we’re still far from concluding that that’s the case,” schiff said, “even though we find, many of us, his conduct anathema and there to be a serious problem here.” the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment. california representative zoe lofgren on friday introduced a resolution urging vice president mike pence and trump’s cabinet to have medical and psychiatric professionals examine the president to help determine whether he can do his job. “many americans, including many republicans, have observed the president’s increasingly disturbing pattern of actions and public statements that suggest he may be mentally unfit to execute the duties required of him,” lofgren said in a statement. representative jackie speier, also of california, said in a twitter post on tuesday that trump was “showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger. time to invoke the 25th amendment.” speier wrote the post after trump’s explosive news conference on tuesday, when he blamed violence in charlottesville, virginia, not just on white nationalist rally organizers but also on counter-protesters. trump said there were “very fine people” in both groups. those comments also provoked criticism from republican senator bob corker, who told reporters on thursday that trump “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,” according to a tennessee local news website. corker did not refer to the 25th amendment in his remarks.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.180000000000003,8.200000000000001,0.0,0.0

putin says u.s. hacking scandal not in russia's interests,"moscow (reuters) - the scandal that erupted in the united states over allegations russia hacked democratic party emails has not been in moscow’s interests and both sides in the u.s. election campaign are just using russia to score points, vladimir putin said on wednesday. the u.s. government on friday formally accused russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election. and the white house said on tuesday it would consider a variety of responses to the alleged hacks. “they started this hysteria, saying that this (hacking) is in russia’s interests. but this has nothing to do with russia’s interests,” president putin told a business forum in moscow. putin said the accusations were a ploy to divert u.s. voters’ attention at a time when public opinion was being manipulated. “everyone is talking about ‘who did it’ (the hacking),” said putin. “but is it that important? the most important thing is what is inside this information.” the kremlin said earlier on wednesday it took a negative view of white house statements about a planned “proportional” response to the alleged cyber attacks. putin complained that all sides in the u.s. presidential race were misusing rhetoric about russia for their own ends, but said moscow would work with whoever won the election “if, of course, the new u.s. leader wishes to work with our country”. “about a decade ago, they wouldn’t mention russia at all, because it was not even worth talking about, such a third-rate regional power and not interesting at all. now russia is problem number one in the entire election campaign,” said putin. “all they do is keep talking about us. of course it’s pleasant for us, but only partly because all participants are misusing anti-russian rhetoric and poisoning our bilateral relations.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.520555555555557,1.8,0.0,0.0
karma: federal judge slaps texas gop bush donor with billion dollar fine for tax fraud,"one of the most notorious republican donors over the last 40 years has been busted for tax fraud and slapped with a hefty penalty.billionaire businessman sam wyly has been a republican since the 1960s and contributed heavily to the presidential campaigns of george h. w. bush and george w. bush.after backing bush 41 in 1988, they helped bush 43 build his own political power by supporting his campaign to be texas governor in 1994 and contributed to his presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004.wyly even contributed to the swift boat campaign that slandered democratic candidate john kerry s service in the vietnam war.in short, wyly is one of the reasons why george w. bush became president for eight years and why we ended up with two wars in the middle east and an economic collapse.well, karma has finally caught up to wyly and it bit him right on the ass.as it turns out, wyly is a tax dodger who shielded much of his fortune through a series of trusts in the cayman islands to hide stock sales from the irs for more than ten years between 1992 and 2004.that s right. one of george w. bush s biggest financial supporters was committing tax fraud the whole time while he simultaneously gave millions of dollars to republican campaigns.and a federal judge smacked him for it on monday.according to reuters:a federal bankruptcy judge in texas on monday ordered former billionaire sam wyly to pay $1.11 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties after finding he committed tax fraud by shielding much of his family s wealth in offshore trusts.u.s. bankruptcy judge barbara houser in dallas calculated the payout after ruling on may 10 that wyly and his late brother charles conducted a deceptive and fraudulent scheme to cheat the internal revenue service.the payout includes roughly $135.5 million of taxes, $402.1 million of interest, and $570.1 million of penalties.it definitely makes one wonder what other big republican donors like the koch brothers have been hiding all this time. after all, they hate the federal government so much that they are buying conservative lawmakers to destroy it from within, and the irs is a major target that republicans have been particularly keen on eliminating. sam wyly getting busted for tax fraud gives a little insight into why they may be so obsessed with completing that goal.featured image via twitter",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.566666666666666,8.666666666666668,0.0,0.0
"cities vow to fight trump on immigration, even if they lose millions - the new york times","los angeles — here in los angeles, where nearly half of the city’s residents are latino, mayor eric garcetti has vowed to do everything he can to fight widespread deportations of illegal immigrants. in new york, with a large and diverse latino population, mayor bill de blasio has pledged not to cooperate with immigration agents. and mayor rahm emanuel of chicago has declared that it “will always be a sanctuary city. ” across the nation, officials in sanctuary cities are gearing up to oppose donald j. trump if he follows through on a campaign promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants. they are promising to maintain their policies of limiting local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents. in doing so, municipal officials risk losing millions of dollars in federal assistance for their cities that helps pay for services like fighting crime and running homeless shelters. mr. trump has vowed to block all federal funding for cities where local law enforcement agencies do not cooperate with immigration and customs enforcement agents. but as mr. trump prepares to take office, democratic bastions, including boston, philadelphia and san francisco, have reaffirmed plans to defy the administration and act as a kind of bulwark against mass deportations. “i like to compare this to conscientious objector status,” said mayor libby schaaf of oakland, calif. “we are not going to use our resources to enforce what we believe are unjust immigration laws. ” supporters of tougher immigration policies, however, expect a swift response. dan stein, the president of the federation for american immigration reform, which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants, predicted “a very aggressive, support for using the full power of the federal government to discourage this kind of interference. ” “these local politicians take it upon themselves to allow people who have been here for a long time to stay here and receive services,” mr. stein said. “the trump administration is basically saying, ‘if you want to accommodate, don’t expect the rest of us to pay for your services. ’” some believe mr. trump could go further than simply pulling federal funding, perhaps fighting such policies in court or even prosecuting city leaders. “this is uncharted territory in some ways, to see if they’re just playing chicken, or see if they will relent,” said jessica vaughan, the director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies, which supports reduced immigration. cities have “gotten away with this for a long time because the federal government has never attempted to crack down on them,” ms. vaughan said. the fight could also signal a twist in the struggle over the power of the federal government, as this time liberal cities — rather than conservative states — resist what they see as federal intervention. cities “may not have the power to give people rights,” said muzaffar chishti, the director of the migration policy institute’s office at the new york university school of law. “but they have a lot of power of resistance, and that’s what they’re displaying right now. ” no legal definition of sanctuary cities exists, and many mayors dislike the label, saying it unfairly describes policies that merely stop local law enforcement from acting as immigration deputies. generally, the term refers to jurisdictions that have placed limits on when local law enforcement agencies comply with federal requests to hold undocumented immigrants for detention and turn them over to immigration and customs enforcement. those requests greatly increased after the obama administration extended nationwide an electronic monitoring system by which the fingerprints of every person booked by local or state police are sent to the department of homeland security for checking against immigration databases. more than 500 counties and cities have some kind of policy limiting cooperation with the immigration authorities, according to an estimate from the immigrant legal resource center, an advocacy and legal assistance group in san francisco and washington. the latest fight is beginning to play out much like one that occurred in the when activists in the nation’s big cities resisted the immigration policies of the reagan administration. central americans had become the subject of fierce political jockeying, and scores of churches opened their doors as sanctuaries to flout the reagan white house. members of churches and synagogues are again offering their houses of worship as sanctuaries for undocumented people fearing deportation, according to groups that work with immigrants and refugees. a network known as the “sanctuary movement” was revived in the past few years to take in those at risk of deportation by the obama administration. in oakland, a site of resistance a generation ago, ms. schaaf has no doubt that the community will again marshal its resources to help undocumented immigrants. the city is exploring ways to offer legal services to immigrants. “we do have many undocumented immigrants, but often these are residents who came to our city as toddlers. they have grown up here and gone to our public schools,” ms. schaaf said. “these are not illegal aliens, they are friends’ children, people sitting next to us in our church pews and on the bus. here it feels much more personal. ” oakland stands to lose as much as $140 million in federal funding for homeless shelters, meals for the elderly and preschool programs. ms. schaaf has started asking local philanthropists if they will put up money to replace any lost federal funds. “this is our highest priority as far as our response to this election,” she said. in the past, conservatives have embraced the notion that state and city officials can assert themselves with immigration laws. one of mr. trump’s immigration advisers is kris w. kobach, who helped write a law in arizona that allowed the police to question people they detained about immigration status. that provision was upheld by the supreme court. rudolph w. giuliani, an adviser to mr. trump who is expected to join his administration, unsuccessfully sued the government in 1996, when he was the mayor of new york, over a federal law he said infringed on local protections for undocumented immigrants. the latest clash will be most acutely felt in california, home to an estimated 2. 3 million of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. not only does the state allow such immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses, but it also offers them college tuition and allows them to hold professional licenses to work as lawyers, architects and nurses. a state law passed in 2014 limits counties’ cooperation with federal officials. the policies came under renewed attack last year, after a young woman was shot by an immigrant with a criminal record who lived in the state illegally and had been released by the authorities in san francisco. los angeles, which in 1979 became the first city to specifically bar officers from stopping people to ask about their immigration status, could lose as much as $500 million of its $9 billion budget. the amount includes money for antiterrorism programs and community health centers. “taking away funding because our law enforcement will not act as federal agents would not only be irresponsible but immoral,” mr. garcetti said. “it would be an unprecedented overreach of federal executive power to take even more of our taxes away. ” mr. de blasio in new york has signaled that he will look for more ways to fight widespread deportations, and the city is directing undocumented immigrants to its free legal services. new york has the country’s largest municipal identification program and maintains a database of nearly a million people. mr. de blasio has pledged not to give any information from the program to the federal government. melissa keaney, a lawyer at the national immigration law center, said the federal government could not compel states to carry out immigration enforcements. “anything that tries to coerce a local government is going to be challenged because these agencies are only responsible for local arrests,” ms. keaney said. “their responsibility is for carrying out public safety criminal law, and it is not within their responsibility or authority to act as federal agents. ” how much cities can fight off deportations, however, remains unclear. legal experts say that city officials cannot bar immigration agents and that it is unlikely that they could declare a physical sanctuary on public property. much of their resistance may lie in simply not cooperating. rick su, a law professor at the university at buffalo who has researched immigration and local government, said that unless mr. trump ratchets up the number and reach of federal immigration agents, “it is difficult to see how he can achieve the two to three million removals that he has proposed without state and local assistance in identifying and detaining suspected unauthorized immigrants. ” for now, many city leaders are focusing on calming undocumented immigrants’ frayed nerves. jorge elorza, the mayor of providence, r. i. and the son of undocumented guatemalan immigrants who were eventually naturalized, stood behind a lectern one recent evening to reassure about 150 people who had filled a high school cafeteria. “folks may feel threatened by what they hear,” mr. elorza told them, addressing the crowd in english and spanish. “we will protect our communities and our families so they can continue to live their lives free of fear and safe in our communities.

anti soros law? hungary tightens rules on foreign-funded ngos,"the hungarian government has passed a new regulatory law on foreign organisations (ngos) such as those funded by billionaire george soros. the law means tougher rules to make the organisations more transparent. [the new legislation, passed by 130 votes to 44 in the hungarian parliament, will see ngos with an annual revenue of more than 7. 2 million hungarian forints ($ £20, 000) be made to register as a “ organisation. ” the hungarian civil liberties union (tasz) has expressed outrage at the new law and has already announced plans for civil disobedience the budapest business journal reports. the spokesman for the hungarian government zoltan kovacs defended the new law noting the government had gone to the european commission for democracy through law, also known as the venice commission, who had seen no problems with it. the venice commission wrote a report on the new law saying it, “pursues a prima facie legitimate aim and can be considered to be necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. ” kovacs also rejected accusations that the law was mimicking a similar law in russia saying that the hungarian law does not require ngos to register as “foreign agents” and does not take away their public funding. the does, however, force ngos to say where their funds are coming from and be more transparent. the law is largely seen by many as a continuation of the hungarian government’s crackdown on international ngos financed by billionaire george soros. hungarian prime minister viktor orban has slammed soros in the past saying that he has agitated within hungary through ngos to open the borders for the mass migration of millions into europe. in a speech at the european parliament in april, orban said, “george soros and his ngos want to transport one million migrants to the eu per year. he has personally, publicly announced this programme and provides a financial loan for it. you could read this yourselves. ” the hungarian government has also passed a law that some have charged as targeting the central european university (ceu) which was founded by soros. orban said that it was unfair for the university to be able to issue u. s. degrees without having a campus in the u. s. as it gave it an advantage over all other hungarian universities. hungary joins a growing number of other eastern european countries who have come out against soros and his ngo network including establishment figures in romania, poland, serbia, bulgaria and slovakia. the hungarian civil liberties union (tasz) have said they will plan civil disobedience in reaction to the ngo law saying it goes against the constitution of hungary itself.",0,9,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,9.765,10.68888888888889,0.0,0.0
"from jakarta to lagos, many muslims voice dismay at trump win","jakarta/islamabad/cairo (reuters) - many muslims around the world expressed dismay on wednesday at donald trump’s election as u.s. president, saying they feared it might raise tensions between the west and islam and contribute to radicalization. while egypt’s president made an early congratulatory call to trump, ordinary muslims were worried that his victory would be a propaganda gift to jihadist groups. others were apprehensive that the president-elect will implement campaign pledges to clamp down on muslims entering the united states. “trump has espoused highly inflammatory rhetoric against muslims. voters there will expect him to fulfill his promises. that makes me worry about the impact on muslims in the u.s. and in the rest of the world,” said yenny wahid, a prominent mainstream muslim figure in indonesia. the world’s 1.6 billion muslims follow a multitude of sects and schools of thought, constitute a majority of the population in countries as varied as indonesia, pakistan, saudi arabia, senegal and albania, and hold a vast array of political views. yet trump’s previous comments about muslims, that those from abroad should be barred entry or intensely scrutinized beforehand, and the presence of vocal anti-islam activists among his supporters, has alarmed many. during a bitter election campaign, trump also attacked his opponents for what he characterized as their denial about the threat posed by militant islam, which he said was “coming to our shores”, adding that he would quickly form a commission on it. egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi was the first world leader to congratulate trump on the phone, sisi’s office said. many other egyptians also welcomed his victory, saying his opponent hillary clinton’s record in office had won her few friends in the most populous arab country. clinton, secretary of state during the 2011 arab spring uprisings, is unpopular with many egyptians. many of those who backed the revolt saw her as a long-standing supporter of hosni mubarak, the autocrat they toppled from power. but elsewhere, other muslims saw trump as a hostile figure. “whatever happens to america affects everybody and with all these promises of doom by trump to the blacks, to the muslims, the minority, so it’s not something we’re happy about,” said ganiu olukanga, a muslim resident of the nigerian capital lagos. some muslims, including wahid, said they feared his election as president might encourage a view that the united states held enmity for muslims and that this would hinder efforts in islam to counter radicalization. “trump’s victory will be an enormous gift to a failing jihadist movement, that will have now have a renewed rallying cry,” said ammar rashid, an academic and member of pakistan’s awami workers party on twitter. “if jihadi ideology has a source of sustenance, it is the image of the us as the evil anti-muslim crusader. they will milk trump’s win dry,” he added. in jihadist social media forums, militants said trump’s election had merely revealed the true position of the united states toward muslims. “the masks have slipped,” one wrote. but some other muslims were more hopeful, including umer daudzai, former afghan minister of interior, citing the record of ronald reagan who was u.s. president from 1981-89. “ronald reagan ended the cold war. i hope donald trump will end all wars and become hero of peace in the world,” he told reuters. among some officials, there were also expressions of concern but the organisation of islamic cooperation (oic), the body that represents muslim states, issued no statement early on wednesday. in indonesia, the most populous muslim nation, an official from the faith’s top clerical body there said trump’s election could create new tension between the united states and the islamic world. trump had made “negative, cynical” comments about muslims in the past, din syamsuddin, a senior official at the indonesian ulema council (mui), told reporters in jakarta. “he had forgotten that many americans are immigrants.” saudi arabia, a u.s. ally that is both birthplace of islam and home to its holiest places, issued a statement that it had congratulated trump on his election win without making further comment. however, awad al-qirni, one of its most popular clerics with a twitter following of two million, said in a social media post after the election - but without referring to trump directly - that “america declines into collapse” and that “its internal crisis will grow severely”. in pakistan, sherry rehman, a senator and former ambassador to washington, said trump’s proposal last year to bar muslims from entering the u.s. had disturbed many. “pakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever america elects but his anti-muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty,” he told reuters on wednesday. and in bangladesh, a government official who asked not to be named said: “i can’t think what awaits us. donald trump was talking about fighting against muslims. are we going to see more wars?” among private citizens in dhaka, some said they hoped the pressure of office would temper trump’s views. “it is just unbelievable and i am a bit tense. i hope there will be a difference between donald trump and president donald trump. president trump will be more mature than individual trump,” asif iqbal, a private sector employee, said.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.936363636363637,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0
ukrainian lawmaker blames russia for deadly kiev blast,"kiev (reuters) - a ukrainian lawmaker wounded in an explosion in kiev that killed two people blamed russia on thursday for the blast while investigators said they were considering various motives for what they called an act of terrorism. ihor mosiychuk, a member of the populist opposition radical party, was hospitalized but did not suffer life-threatening injuries, while his bodyguard and a passerby were killed. two others were wounded. since fighting with pro-russian separatists in eastern ukraine broke out in 2014, the number of incidents involving explosives outside the conflict zone has increased. there has been a spate of vehicle bombings over the past 18 months in kiev, the capital, and elsewhere, but investigators have failed to find those responsible. ukraine s state security service (sbu) said that unknown perpetrators had rigged a motorcycle with explosives on wednesday that detonated as the lawmaker left a tv station. radical party leader oleg lyashko said he had no doubt the incident was politically motivated, while mosiychuk blamed russia. i believe that the initiators are in moscow, the executors are in kiev, mosiychuk said on facebook. russian involvement is one of the possible motives being investigated, deputy kiev prosecutor pavlo kononenko told journalists. another explanation is mosiychuk s political activity, his public position within our country, he said. a third explanation is an attempt on mosiychuk s life for personal reasons. the kremlin dismissed the accusations as a product of anti-russian sentiment. beyond all doubt, these are new signs of this anti-russian campaign which has unfortunately swept across ukraine and kiev, russian president vladimir putin s spokesman dmitry peskov said in a conference call with reporters. relations between kiev and moscow collapsed in 2014 after russia seized ukraine s crimea peninsula and backed a pro-russian separatist insurgency in eastern ukrainian regions. radical party lawmaker evhen deidei posted photos on his facebook page from the scene of wednesday s attack which showed the burnt-out shell of a motorcycle in front of a damaged vehicle. judging by the damage to the car and the shrapnel holes in the doors, the power of the explosion was pretty strong, he said. there is a lot of blood on the stairs, where ihor was situated at the time of the explosion. the interior ministry s shkiryak said political analyst vitaliy bala was one of the three wounded in the blast. in june, a colonel in ukraine s military intelligence was killed by a car bomb in central kiev. in 2016 a prominent investigative journalist, pavel sheremet, was killed by an explosive device in his car.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.130000000000003,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
"cbo posts review of republican healthcare plan, it’s a bloodbath: 24 million+ uninsured (details)","the congressional budget office, tasked with providing congress with a nonpartisan assessment of the effects of proposed legislation, has finally released its analysis of the republican healthcare replacement plan and it s abundantly clearly why paul ryan tried to pass the bill before the cbo was able to take a look. it s a bloodbath.for starters, the cbo calculates that as many as 14 million people will lose their insurance within the year, many of which only recently started having health insurance thanks to the aca. as a replacement this plan is clearly inferior. even worse, by 2026, 24 million more people will be uninsured as compared to this very moment. america will see a near total collapse of the health care system as we currently understand it.republicans argue that tens of millions more without health insurance is okay because they are saving america money. the cbo suggests the savings would be almost nonexistent relative to the costs (not to mention the human suffering). they calculate that gop s bill will only save around $300 billion over a decade. compared to the trillions of dollars that are budgeted out each year, that s a rounding error.#cbo is out 24 million more uninsured by 2026, $337 billion of budget savings over a decade. https://t.co/wldnx8lemy marc goldwein (@marcgoldwein) march 13, 2017they also argue that this disruption will actually cost america around a trillion dollars in lost revenue, offsetting much of the savings it hopes to gain by cutting spending.cbo and jct estimate that enacting the legislation would reduce federal deficits by $337 billion over the 2017-2026 period. that total consists of $323 billion in on-budget savings and $13 billion in off-budget savings. outlays [i.e. what the government spends] would be reduced by $1.2 trillion over the period, and revenues would be reduced by $0.9 trillion.yeah, this is very, very bad.and republicans did not want the american people to see this.wh reading cbo pic.twitter.com/llkwpxkzei eric boehlert (@ericboehlert) march 13, 2017ryan s response will likely be the same one that he s been giving all week. the tens of millions who are about to lose their insurance are actually enjoying the benefits of choice. choice, in his mind, translates to being rich and having health insurance (also a tax break) or poor and not having health insurance. that s freedom to paul ryan. what a guy.the cbo s review only reinforces the fact that the republicans had 8 years to come up with a replacement plan, failed to do so, and when pressed quickly created one that is inferior to the aca in every single way. the level of incompetence and cruelty required to draft something like this continues to remain astonishing.featured image via win mcnamee/getty images",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.05263157894736842,10.098571428571429,11.314285714285715,0.0,0.0
there’s something very weird about nearly half of trump’s twitter followers,"to donald trump, his popularity is everything, which may be why his favorite mode of communication is twitter. twitter s model of having people follow other twitter accounts, rather than having a mutual friendship gives celebrities and notables opportunities to collect thousands or even millions of followers.trump s personal account has about 31 million followers, which is nothing to sneeze at. then again katy perry has nearly 100 million and barack obama nearly 90 million. you have to know that drives trump absolutely crazy.trump has been doing some housecleaning recently by blocking some of his more contentious followers (i know several who were blocked just last week). still, his twitter following dramatically increased on tuesday, and there s something very weird about many of those followers. they don t have pictures and they ve never tweeted.trump s twitter acc has suddenly gained 3 mil followers and has been blocking lots of people. new followers look like this pic.twitter.com/uzykensjuc john niven (@nivenj1) may 30, 2017john niven wasn t cherry picking. if you click on trump s recent followers, more of them have no pictures and no tweets than those who are active twitter users. they re an oddly international (given trump s nationalism) group of followers as well.these followers are likely bots. they aren t people at all. according to twitter audit, only 51 percent of trump s followers are real. nearly half are fake, and that s not just the new ones.the number of fake accounts has gotten a lot worse since trump took office.this isn t the first time someone has pointed out that a good portion of trump s twitter following is fake, but what s interesting is that its fakeness seems to be increasing. in january, journalist yashar ali ran an audit on trump s twitter account and found that 68 percent of his then-20 million followers were real. now he s at 30 million followers, but only 51 percent are real, which means of 10 million followers trump has gained since january, about 8.3 million are fake. compare that to barack obama. 79 percent are real.in april 2016, when trump was beginning to gain traction as a serious candidate to at least win the republican presidential nomination, the former reality tv star had a mere 7.58 million followers, only 8 percent of which were fake, according to fivethirtyeight. it s not surprising that as trump s global profile has skyrocketed in the past 13 months, so too have the number of bots attached to his twitter account but it s astonishing how much the percentage of his followers that are fake has risen.source: newsweekwhile fake followers are a pretty serious problem on facebook, and not one that the user can always control, it is easy to buy twitter followers and it s a big problem.automated adding to lists or collections: you may not add twitter users to lists or add tweets to collections in a bulk or indiscriminate manner. adding a large number of unrelated users to lists is a violation of the twitter rules.if trump did pay for the followers (and perhaps even if he didn t), he s violating twitter s rules and his account should be banned.featured image via pool/getty images.",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0

trump renews criticism of london mayor khan over attack,"london (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump once again criticized london mayor sadiq khan on monday over his response to a deadly attack on the city, while the british public and politicians lauded the mayor for his handling of the aftermath. trump accused khan of making a “pathetic excuse” over his statement urging londoners not to be alarmed by the presence of additional police on the streets in response to the attack. but british prime minister theresa may said khan was doing a “good job”, echoing public sentiment across london. three jihadis drove a van into pedestrians on london bridge on saturday night before running into the bustling borough market area where they slit people’s throats and stabbed them indiscriminately. police shot dead all three attackers. khan had said on sunday morning that people would see an increased police presence on the streets of the capital and should not be alarmed by that. trump mocked khan’s comment on sunday, suggesting in a tweet that the mayor was downplaying the attacks. a spokesman for khan responded that the mayor “has more important things to do than respond to donald trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context” his remarks. trump’s comments drew widespread scorn in britain but the u.s. leader went on the attack again on monday, saying in a tweet: “pathetic excuse by london mayor sadiq khan who had to think fast on his ‘no reason to be alarmed’ statement. msm is working hard to sell it!” trump wrote. msm referred to mainstream media. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said she did not think it was fair to characterize trump’s tweets as “picking a fight” with khan, who is the first muslim elected as london mayor. “the point is, there is a reason to be alarmed. we have constant attacks going on, not just there but across the globe, and we have to start putting national security and global security at an all time high,” she told a white house briefing. khan said he had been too busy dealing with the fallout from the attack to respond directly to the tweet. khan, who belongs to the opposition labour party, is popular in london and his response to saturday’s killings has been widely praised as dignified. prime minister may, the conservative party leader, was asked earlier on monday about trump’s criticism of khan. “i think sadiq khan is doing a good job and it is wrong to say anything else,” she said. khan’s statement on sunday morning condemned the attack and gave a number of details about what had happened and what measures were being taken in response. “londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. no reason to be alarmed. one of the things the police, all of us need to do is make sure we’re as safe as we possibly can be,” khan said. in his sunday tweet, trump commented: “at least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’” it was met with a barrage of criticism in both britain and the united states, with former vice president al gore among many public figures who accused trump of misrepresenting what khan had said. a yougov poll of 1,000 londoners published on monday found that khan was more trusted than both may and national labour leader jeremy corbyn to make the right decisions about keeping britain safe from terrorism. “my focus from saturday night has been working with the police the emergency services and the government to deal with the horrific attack on saturday,” khan told sky news, when asked about trump’s latest tweet. “i just haven’t got time to respond to tweets from donald trump. i’ve got better and more important things to focus on.” the two men have history. during the u.s. presidential election campaign, khan was among many people who spoke out against trump’s proposed ban on muslims entering the united states, an idea he said would play into the hands of extremists. during a visit to chicago in september last year, khan endorsed trump’s opponent hillary clinton. in march, after an attack by an islamic militant that left five people dead in westminster, central london, trump’s son donald trump jr. issued a tweet that criticized khan. trump jr. wrote “you have got to be kidding me?!” above a link to an article reporting comments khan had made months earlier. in the article, khan was reported as saying that being prepared for terror attacks was “part and parcel” of living in a major city.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0

u.s. republican senator moves toward re-election despite trump tiff,"washington (reuters) - another u.s. republican senator has moved closer to re-election while keeping some distance from donald trump, and experts say this suggests the party’s presidential candidate may be having little down-ballot impact, at least at the primary stage. senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire still faces a tough general election challenge on nov. 8 but she crushed a pro-trump, republican challenger in a primary contest on tuesday, winning close to 80 percent of the vote. ayotte has refused to endorse trump although, like a number of republicans, she has said she will vote for him. some republicans, such as ohio senator rob portman, have endorsed trump but excluded him from their campaigns. senator lisa murkowski of alaska won her primary in august although she had said she did not know whether she would vote for trump. trump, a new york businessman who has never held elected office, at first criticized ayotte. then he changed course early last month and endorsed her, along with fellow republicans house speaker paul ryan and senator john mccain. with ayotte’s victory, all incumbent republican senators running for re-election have won their primaries this year. this is not uncommon but it is unusual for so many senators to hold their party’s presidential nominee at arm’s length. u.s. senators serve six-year-terms. one-third of the 100-member senate faces voters every two years. the outcome so far shows some voters are distinguishing this year between trump and the rest of the ballot, said nathan gonzales, editor of the rothenberg & gonzales political report, a non-partisan newsletter. “his impact has been less dramatic than what was initially expected, but there is still time for things to get worse for the republican party,” gonzales said in a telephone interview. “at a time when republicans in presidential primaries basically rejected everybody from the status quo, they are not doing that in senate or house primaries,” norman ornstein, a political scientist at the american enterprise institute, a conservative think tank, said by telephone. republicans are still worried that voters who do not like trump will not turn out to vote for other republicans in the general election on nov. 8, gonzales said. “is there a trump drag (on down-ballot candidates)? there doesn’t appear to be much of one,” said jennifer duffy, senior editor at the non-partisan cook political report. ohio’s portman, who has not appeared with trump on the campaign trail, easily beat his primary opponent and has opened up a lead over his democratic challenger in the general election. mccain and ryan have had very public differences of opinion with trump but they also prevailed in their primary races. ayotte beat a field of four challengers in new hampshire, receiving nearly 80 percent of the vote, according to election results posted online by the state. she must still take on democratic new hampshire governor maggie hassan in the general election. ayotte was leading hassan by 52 percent to 44 percent in a sept. 6-8 nbc/wall street journal/marist poll, according to the website realclear politics. “i think you probably have a lot of people in the primary who were not going to pay as close attention to what she was saying about trump,” ornstein said of ayotte. “in the fall it may be a different matter, as certainly maggie hassan is going to try to tie her to trump.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.831111111111113,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0

soda tax passes in philadelphia. advocates ask: who’s next? - the new york times,"philadelphia — forty times, city or state governments had proposed taxes on sugary soft drinks, failing each time. then, in 2014, liberal berkeley, calif. passed such a tax, but most people saw it as an aberration. several measures, including one in new york, never won much support. but on thursday, a measure to tax sweetened drinks passed in philadelphia, one of the country’s largest cities — and also one of its poorest. indeed, raising revenue was the winning argument in philadelphia. jim kenney, the mayor, took a different tack from that of politicians who have tried and failed to pass taxes. he didn’t talk about the tax as a measure designed to discourage soft drinks. and he didn’t promise to earmark the proceeds for health programs. instead, he cast the soft drink industry as a tantalizing revenue source that could be tapped to fund popular city programs, including universal prekindergarten. “this is the beginning of a process of changing the narrative of poverty in our city,” he said in a news conference after the vote. the advocates who have pushed for the policy say the victory is a sign of growing public acceptance of soft drink taxes and presages more such measures around the country. though city officials didn’t talk much about the health consequences of soda, experts said that sugary drinks’ increasingly bad reputation made it an appropriate political target. “if we go five years ahead and look back, i think this is going to be a watershed moment,” said jim krieger, executive director at healthy food america, an organization that is helping cities around the country that are considering soda taxes. “this is going to really provide momentum. ” san francisco oakland, calif. and boulder, colo. are considering soft drink taxes this year. mr. krieger said the list of interested cities included some that were as large and diverse as philadelphia. mr. kenney said he hadn’t yet spoken directly with officials from other cities, but he had advice for them. “tie your efforts to tangible initiatives that people care about,” he said in his news conference. “when it comes up, acknowledge that it is a good thing to drink less beverages, but tie it to things that people care about. ” the philadelphia tax of 1. 5 cents an ounce will apply to all sugary or artificially sweetened drinks sold by distributors in the city. it is expected to increase prices — the tax is about 30 cents for a drink, or $2. 16 for a . if passed on to consumers, the increase is expected to substantially reduce sales of sweetened drinks. the city finance department estimates it will raise $91 million a year. sugary drinks have been linked to health problems, including obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, but the public health effects of the taxes are still unclear. philadelphia is likely to become the site of public health research. thomas farley, the city’s health commissioner, said the city had already planned to measure the tax’s immediate effects on sales. studies will measure any impact on obesity. the soft drink industry and its allies, including the teamsters union and local grocers, spent nearly $5 million on lobbying and advertising to fight the tax in philadelphia. they held rallies and demonstrations downtown and ran ads on television and the radio, right up until thursday’s final vote. they branded the drinks tax measure a “grocery tax,” suggesting that more food products were next. the soda industry has argued that philadelphia’s politics are unusual and that the vote here can’t be seen as predictive. the american beverage association, a trade group, has vowed to fight the measure in the courts. “it’s still a bad idea,” said lauren kane, a spokeswoman for the group. “people still oppose it. nothing has changed. ” thursday, the industry and its allies vented frustration. daniel grace, the secretary and treasurer of the teamsters local, said advocates had “snookered city council,” and he described the tax as a “brazen cash grab from one industry. ” the promise of prekindergarten energized the city’s education advocates, who joined with public health advocates. the coalition spent about $2 million on advertisements, according to kevin feeley, a spokesman for philadelphians for a fair future, a group supporting the tax. that total included $1. 6 million in donations from michael r. bloomberg, the former new york mayor, who has long supported soda taxes. but mr. kenney’s focus on revenue also allowed him to help cut deals with skeptical city councilors. ultimately, the soft drink tax revenue won’t pay just for prekindergarten, but for a host of city programs, reflecting the priorities of the council members who voted for it.",0,14,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,5.161538461538463,7.887179487179488,0.0,0.0

georgia republican threatens to ‘disappear’ democrat over monuments to slavery,"a furious georgia republican issued a horrifying threat to a democrat over her push to remove confederate statues. in an ominous social media post, state rep. jason spencer warned that if former state rep. ladawn jones doesn t abandon her fight against monuments to slavery, she might go missing. in a contentious back and forth on facebook, spencer told jones that people in south georgia are people of action, not drama and then added that people who don t understand that will go missing in the okefenokee. too many necks they are red around here, he wrote. don t say i didn t warn you about em. jones, a black woman who represented an atlanta-based district from 2012 to 2016, did not back down from spencer s threat of physical violence. enjoy but know winter is coming, jones wrote back. you know it too otherwise you wouldn t have found a need to even make this post or those hollow threats of not coming to south ga. spencer now swears that he really wasn t threatening jones. of course. no, to the contrary, he was just trying to keep her safe by giving a warning to her of how people can behave about this issue. (insert eye roll here.) she is from atlanta and the rest of georgia sees this issue very differently, spencer said. just trying to keep her safe if she decided to come down and raise hell about the memorial in the back yards of folks who will see this as an unwelcome aggression from the left. jones later said in an interview that she and spencer had developed a friendship during their time representing the people of georgia and that she wasn t worried about his online threat. if it were anybody other than jason spencer, then i would be alarmed. but we had a unique relationship in the georgia legislature, jones said. if that had come from anybody else, i d take it as a serious threat. but she did say that she was very concerned by his appalling reaction to her efforts to remove the statues of people who fought against the u.s. in their quest to continue the practice of owning people based on skin color. because if that s representative of what people in south georgia think, then yikes. you can read the tense exchange in its entirety here:featured image via screenshot",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,16.63,24.0,0.0,0.0

comment on there has to be a cheaper way to find the worst people — 2016 elections will cost over $6 billion by doucyet,"watch: aerial footage catches man stopping at a drive thru — while being chased by police home / be the change / government corruption / there has to be a cheaper way to find the worst people — 2016 elections will cost over $6 billion there has to be a cheaper way to find the worst people — 2016 elections will cost over $6 billion claire bernish october 30, 2016 2 comments this presidential election cycle has been nothing, if not a controversy-laden shit show of the bizarre — and a monumentally pricey one, at that. it’s now estimated the stupefying cost for the duopoly to provide us with two altogether unappealing candidates — possibly the least liked in american electoral history — as well as congressional minions, totals no less than $6.6 billion. and that’s a conservative figure. despite nearly a century of anti-marijuana propaganda inundating schools, ads, and politics, in fact, legalizing cannabis has greater approval from the public than either hillary clinton or donald trump. yet, the two candidates, their respective political parties, outside groups, and individual donors will, all told, spend around 86.5 million inflation-adjusted dollars more than on the 2012 presidential election. there simply must be a cheaper way to find two people no one wants to vote for. hell, giant meteor — the satirical no-party candidate whose slogan, “just end it already,” speaks volumes to weariness — has amassed a sizeable following in recent months, as the public apparently abandons all pretense of hope. to wit, 70 percent of voters likely to support hillary clinton, and a stunning 41 percent of all likely voters, would re-elect president barack obama if a third term were legal, rasmussen reports. so, if the public harbors only negligible fondness for clinton and trump, who deems them worthy of such colossal sums? unsurprisingly in both cases, it’s the elite — the billionaires and millionaires directly, indirectly, and sometimes shadily channeling their fortunes in hopes their chosen nominee will conform policy favorable to their interests from the helm of the white house. opensecrets.org reports : “candidates and news outlets have decried the outsized influence of a small number of donors throughout the election season. here’s a startling statistic: the top 100 families have given about 11.9 percent to the total $5.5 billion raised at this point, compared to 5.6 percent in all of 2012. their names are familiar — thomas and kathryn steyer have given $57.2 million to liberal causes, sheldon and miriam adelson have doled out $47.3 million to gop-allied forces, and donald sussman has so far provided $34.4 million to groups helping democrats. expect to see this list shift a bit: facebook cofounder dustin moskovitz pledged an additional $35 million to defeat donald trump earlier this month.” perhaps surprisingly to some, billionaire globalist and avid political influencer, george soros, ranked only 9th in the list of top donors, contributing ‘just’ $17,689,038. and this election cycle hasn’t been devoid of grassroots political donors, either, although their chosen ‘voice of the people’ candidate, bernie sanders, has since dropped out and endorsed hillary clinton — leaving a legacy of heartbroken, if not embittered, young voters scrambling for options — and an older, wiser generation hardly able to contain its i told you so’s . opensecrets continues: “the obama re-election campaign floored campaign finance experts with his knack for tapping into the small donor pool — an impressive 32 percent of the campaign’s total funds came from people giving $200 or less in 2012. but bernie sanders topped that. more than half of his contributions, or 59 percent, came from small donors, totaling $134.6 million, which is about one and half times as much as clinton and more than twice as much as trump.” clearly, the so-called ‘little guy’ has nary the clout enjoyed by the privileged, moneyed class — and though that might be widely understood — the reminder dark horse candidates rarely make it to the big race seems more pronounced than ever in recent years. as an independent, sanders’ decision to run on the democratic ticket against the all-powerful clinton, as a democratic socialist, no less, seemed fated to fail from the start — after all, groundbreaking though his bid was, a populist david vowing to disassemble the corporate, banking goliath could never reap the billionaire financing to endure. “in a campaign that has broken new ground in lots of ways, there’s at least one thing we can depend on, and that’s record-breaking spending on u.s. elections,” explained sheila krumholz, executive director of the center for responsive politics. “while this campaign saw the rise of the small donor and a fall in spending reported by groups that hide their donors, overall, important trends hold true: more money is still coming from a tiny set of elite donors. it’s going to super pacs that are scarcely independent of the campaigns they support. and it’s targeting competitive races where the vote will be closest and the opportunity to have an impact, greatest.” in effect, the elite doles out its fortunes on elite candidates who will best serve the elite’s interests — but, nah, take it from hillary: the russians might rig the election. money is proportionate to influence, it could justifiably be argued, and in an election cycle costing upwards of $7 billion, the overwhelming majority of us pull literally zero weight. finagling the popular vote constitutes little more than a distraction for the political heavyweights, whose insider connections and corporate and industry backers effectively usurped what little import the average american voter maintained when the supreme court ruled in their favor with the notorious corporations are people citizens united decision in 2010. whatever vociferous contention clinton and trump might garner from an unusually alert populace this election season, don’t be fooled — the elite ultimately pull the strings — the vote is merely an illusory construct of a severely limited choice between two candidates of their choosing. not ours. all told, just remember the words of mark twain: “if voting made any difference they wouldn’t let us do it.” share",1,24,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.771304347826089,10.93913043478261,0.041666666666666664,0.0
"in historic first, icc preparing to investigate us war crimes in afghanistan","in historic first, icc preparing to investigate us war crimes in afghanistan an employee of doctors without borders stands among the charred remains of a hospital hit by a u.s. airstrike in kunduz, afghanistan. (najim rahim / ap) the international criminal court (icc) is preparing to initiate a full investigation into potential war crimes in afghanistan, including those committed by u.s. military personnel, foreign policy exclusively reported tuesday. the magazine writes: multiple sources have indicated that the chief prosecutor, fatou bensouda, will seek to initiate an investigation in the coming weeks, likely after the u.s. presidential election but before the end of the year. u.s. officials visited the hague recently to discuss the potential investigation and to express concerns about its scope. a formal investigation of u.s. activities would be the first in the history of the icc, to which the u.s. is not a party. but because afghanistan is a member, an investigation is “certainly possible,” phyllis bennis of the institute for policy studies told common dreams. “afghanistan joined the icc in 2003, so all actions after that time are subject to icc jurisdiction,” bennis said. “but then you get to the question of political will,” bennis added. the icc has famously failed to investigate powerful western nations while prosecuting african dictators, a disparity so glaring that several african countries recently quit the court, condemning it as the “international caucasian court.” “is the prosecutor concerned enough about the accusations of discrimination levied against the icc that she’s willing to go after u.s. clients and u.s. officials?” bennis asked. rights advocates hope that bensouda may be willing to take aim at powerful nations. the prosecutor was behind the preliminary icc report published last year, “report on preliminary examination activities,” which suggested that the u.s. was “responsible for ‘physical and psychological’ violence and torture that ‘debased the basic human dignity’ of those detained” in afghanistan, as common dreams reported . indeed, photos released by the pentagon earlier this year demonstrated the brutal abuse of detainees at the hands of u.s. forces in afghanistan. bensouda may also probe the deadly bombing by u.s. forces of a doctors without borders/médecins sans frontières (msf) hospital in kunduz, foreign policy reports. msf has characterized the airstrike as a war crime, and rights groups have harshly criticized the pentagon for its light punishment of those responsible for the attack. despite the looming investigation, foreign policy observes that prosecution of u.s. forces for war crimes is still a long way away and may not happen: [prosecution] would require significantly more evidence than the prosecutor’s office currently possesses. the icc normally does not interview witnesses, take testimony, or gather forensic evidence during its preliminary examinations, and that work would be just the beginning. in order to charge americans with war crimes, bensouda would likely also have to demonstrate a link between the conflict in afghanistan and u.s. detention policies, which may not be easy; the united states reportedly brought several detainees to afghanistan from other parts of the world. perhaps most controversial, the prosecutor’s office would have to determine that the united states has failed to address allegations of torture through its own domestic prosecutions, investigations, and reviews. moreover, any indictments related to afghanistan would be months if not years away. because no icc member has referred the situation to the court, bensouda will need the approval of a three-judge panel before launching an investigation. icc judges have approved all three previous investigative requests from the prosecutor (in kenya, cote d’ivoire, and georgia), but their review can take several months, and the judges might request additional information before authorizing an investigation. “still, the readiness of the prosecutor’s office to open an investigation represents a sharp setback for president barack obama’s administration, which has sought several times to discourage an investigation in afghanistan and even to avoid icc mention of possible u.s. crimes,” foreign policy notes. and once an investigation is underway, bennis noted, the icc prosecutor will be faced with “the question of how far up the chain of command do you go.” “do you start and stop with the soldier who tortured and abused detainees? this is what happened with abu ghraib,” bennis explained. “individual soldiers were slapped on the wrist. their commanders who set the standards that said it was okay to humiliate and sexually abuse people, to tie them up naked in a dog collar and take pictures of it—the commander establishes the tone of what their work entailed, but that was never considered.” bennis observed: “one of the questions that will have to be dealt with by the prosecutor if she decides to go forward is: do you go all the way up? do you go after george w. bush for using torture as a part of u.s. strategy? tags:",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.07692307692307693,10.723333333333333,18.133333333333336,0.0,0.0
colbert shreds the gop for creating trump and this one fact they forgot (video),"during a segment on the late show, host stephen colbert ripped the gop for creating the monster that is donald trump. republicans are right now working double time to slay the beast.right now, the gop s strategy is to urge people to vote for any candidate who they think can win enough delegates to take down trump. mocking this strategy, colbert says: what an inspiring message for the world s greatest democracy. don t vote for who you think should be president, vote for whichever candidate in your state has the best chance of keeping trump from getting enough delegates. it s a system often employed by bros in bars that rhymes with clock block. the gop has cast mitt romney as their knight in republican red. the republican establishment thinks that romney s anti-trump political crusade might be what is needed to halt trump in his tracks. however, as colbert notes, there is something that the gop seems to have forgotten trump isn t a politician. this guy says that s the only way to save democracy from the voters. after you vote, maybe they ll give you a sticker that says, i did what mitt romney told me to do. this game of ganging up on the popular guy that s actually winning, that s not democracy that s a reality show strategy. and that s trump s home turf. do you honestly think you re going to be better at this than him? trump is not running a political campaign, colbert continues. he s a reality show contestant who has established himself as a villain to polarize the audience and then do whatever it takes to get to the final tribal council to get the rose that lets him have sex with the top chef. then you get to name a supreme court justice in the fantasy suite. it looks like the only thing that will take down trump s campaign is the democratic nominee. fortunately, polls indicate that there is an almost guaranteed chance of a dem trouncing trump in the general election.you can watch the segment below.featured image from video screenshot",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0625,6.727142857142859,11.314285714285715,0.0,0.0

let’s compare president obama’s memorial day statement to donald trump’s,"the mere thought that donald trump could succeed president obama is mindboggling. if you need any visual representation to figure this out, look no closer than the two s personal twitter statements honoring memorial day.first we have the commander in chief s:this memorial day, i hope you ll join me in acts of remembrance. the debt we owe our fallen heroes is one we can never truly repay. president obama (@potus) may 30, 2016and now donald trump s wonderful tribute: have a great memorial day and remember that we will soon make america great again! donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) may 30, 2016so one honors america s fallen and the other decides to use it as a campaign pitch that eerily resembles hitler s slogan. how fitting for a memorial day tribute. while president obama lays the wreath on the tomb of the unknown soldier, trump decides to spend his day railing against hispanic immigrants, complaining about bernie sanders rally sizes, and of course pledged to build the wall.so instead of actually honoring those who have fallen, trump continued to bloat his ego and echo his stupid campaign slogans to a group of angry bikers.but the best tweet donald trump ever sent out on memorial day is from last year when he decided to use the day to attack those who don t support him:i would like to wish everyone, including all haters and losers (of which, sadly, there are many) a truly happy and enjoyable memorial day! donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) may 24, 2015so there s that. president obama, the democrat, honors those who gave their lives for us while trump, the republican, insults his haters and those he perceives to be losers.the difference is night and day. the fact republicans really think their people care about veterans is laughable especially now that trump is their nominee.should trump win the presidential election, veterans and service members alike will be missing president obama something fierce.featured image via pool/getty images",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.07692307692307693,10.73,12.0,0.0,0.0

carson doubles down on 'muslim' comments: 'sharia inconsistent with constitution',"the islamic faith isn’t “consistent” with the u.s. constitution, and a muslim shouldn’t be president, republican presidential candidate ben carson said. “i would not advocate that we put a muslim in charge of this nation,” carson said on nbc’s 'meet the press' on sunday. late sunday, he doubled down on those comments in an interview with the hill. “i do not believe sharia is consistent with the constitution of this country,” carson told the hill. “muslims feel that their religion is very much a part of your public life and what you do as a public official, and that’s inconsistent with our principles and our constitution.” editor's note: is ben carson your candidate for 2016? vote here. earlier, carson told nbc's chuck todd that the religious beliefs of a president would matter if his or her faith was inconsistent with u.s. values. his view contrasted with that of donald trump, the billionaire front-runner for the republican presidential nomination, who said on the program that a muslim as president is something that could happen in the future. trump said he knows many muslims who are “fabulous,” but there’s “a very severe problem” with some muslims around the world -- comments he repeated on other sunday broadcasts. special: dr. ben carson's vision for america, see it “this is the first i’ve ever gotten into hot water for not saying anything,” trump said. trump and carson both said they believe obama is a christian. story continues below video.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.91,12.0,0.0,0.0

"aiming to break isis, dollar by dollar","a un meeting aims to coordinate financial efforts against the islamic state. it can't deliver a knockout blow, but it can make an impact. how snl's 'the bubble' sketch about polarization is all too true smoke rises as iraqi security forces and allied popular mobilization forces shell islamic state group positions at an oil field outside beiji, iraq, 155 miles north of baghdad last month. the united states and russia are going after the islamic state group’s oil industry, destroying refineries and hundreds of tanker trucks transporting oil from eastern syria in a heavy bombardment in recent days aiming to break the extremists’ biggest source of income. the finance ministers set to meet at the united nations can’t put the islamic state in a financial vise. but they can deliver some critical blows to an organization already showing signs of financial strain. and for a un security council often at odds, the meeting of its finance ministers next week comes at an opportune moment, when terrorists attacks worldwide have created a sense of shared purpose – even, it seems, between the united states and russia. the core of the islamic state’s wealth is, in many respects, beyond the reach of next week’s meetings, hosted by the us. only turkey can shut its borders to the smugglers who carry islamic state oil and other contraband, and only military force can deprive the group of the territory it uses for extortion and taxation. but a more coordinated effort at targeting the islamic state’s finances can pay dividends. the us and others, for example, have used bank reports of suspicious financial transactions to more effectively target locations where the islamic state is producing and loading oil products. ramping up this coordination is akin to “squeezing the balloon” of islamic state finances – though “not yet hard enough to pop it,” says matthew levitt, director of the counterterrorism and intelligence program at the washington institute for near east policy. and it is vital to defeating the islamic state, he says. “any opportunity to get this level of attention and cooperation on an issue that will be central to destroying isis should be seized and built upon.” terrorist attacks linked to the islamic state in beirut, paris, and san bernadino, calif., appear to have galvanized the international community. “what is reassuring is how much the nations of the world are taking this threat more and more seriously and working together with greater unity,” said farhan haq, a spokesman for un secretary general ban ki-moon, to journalists earlier this week. particularly promising are indications the us and russia “agree that the effort to dry up isis funding can and must be toughened up,” says mr. levitt, using another acronym for the islamic state. both the us and russia are pushing for a new council resolution on terror financing and could agree on one text by the dec. 17 summit. already, there are indications that the islamic state is feeling a financial pinch. holding the finance ministers summit at the security council underscores the importance world leaders are placing on both terror financing and the coordination of financial, intelligence, and military efforts. the summit will mark the first time that a council session will be chaired by a financial official – us treasury secretary jack lew. the finance ministers can work to apply greater scrutiny across the board – from financial transactions that offer crucial clues about the islamic state economy to money brought into the islamic state by foreign fighters and donors around the region. but the summit can only do so much. half or more of the islamic state’s financial resources are generated from taxation or extortion within the territories the group controls in syria and iraq. that means that successfully cutting islamic state funding is directly linked to the international military campaigns aimed at shrinking its territory. “there are a number of actions that can be taken to reduce the financial streams, but one thing is clear: if you want to deprive isis of cash, you deprive it of territory,” says jonathan schanzer, vice president for research at the foundation for the defense of democracies in washington. moreover, the islamic state trafficks much of its oil and antiquities across turkey’s border with syria, experts say. the us has been pressing turkey for months – mostly behind closed doors – to do more, while russia has been much more public with its accusations. next week’s meetings are an opportunity for the international community to get on the same page to tackle some of these bigger funding streams. “we’re not going to get anywhere on a critical issue like terror

rubio’s campaign just committed suicide in this state for good reasons (video),"marco rubio has officially joined the anti-trump squad. rubio is now urging his supporters in ohio to vote for their governor john kasich.ohio is kasich s home state and is the only candidate who has a shot of taking down trump in their primary election. michigan proved that kasich has wide support in the rust belt region of the midwest, though he did not have enough support in the peninsula to actually take down trump.rubio s campaign director, alex conant, told cnn that he and the campaign recognize that rallying behind kasich is their best chance of keeping ohio s 66 delegates out of trump s hands. polls show trump ahead in ohio but if non-trump supporter republicans go all in on kasich, it might be enough for the candidate to take the state. if you are a republican primary voter in ohio and you want to defeat donald trump, your best chance in ohio is john kasich, conant told cnn on friday.like any good communications director would conant took the opportunity to drive the point home that what holds true for kasich in ohio, is also true of rubio in florida. if you re a voter and marco rubio is not necessarily your first choice if you like john kasich or you like ted cruz and you re here in florida, you need to vote for marco rubio because he s the only one who can deprive donald trump of those 99 delegates, conant went on to say. and if we stop donald trump here in florida, we can stop him in cleveland. he will not be the republican nominee. rubio does stand the best chance to steal away with florida s 99 delegates. that s actually a huge problem for republicans. polls show trump blowing rubio out of the water in the gator state. in order for rubio to take florida, both ted cruz and kasich supporters would have to go all in for rubio.that doesn t seem likely. cruz s campaign has burned many bridges with rubio s campaign during the election. as the runner-up, cruz also has to maintain the posturing that comes with that position.one thing is for sure, next tuesday s elections will probably decide who will take the republican presidential nomination. for rubio, it will almost certainly be the end of his significance in the race, if not the end for him altogether.you can watch the relevant portion of the interview below.featured image from gage skidmore via flickr",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.723333333333333,18.133333333333336,0.0,0.0
watch: trump doesn’t want us to remember what he said about russia in 2014,"as time goes on, it becomes ever clearer that trump is russia s puppet. there s every possibility he owes them money, and he s repeatedly blasted our intelligence community for daring to say that russia did, indeed, engage in a concerted campaign to influence our election in trump s favor. but did he always feel this way? was he always russia s puppet?it seems not, and it s by his own words that we know this. as recently as 2014, he said, in a series of interviews, that mitt romney was right to say that russia was our greatest geopolitical foe: [mitt] said [russia is] a hell of a problem, and everybody laughed at him, including certain media, by the way. they laughed. it turned out that he s absolutely right. you look at what russia s doing with iran, how they controlled the situation, and syria, and virtually every other place. he also insinuated that obama was putin s puppet because he felt we being meek and cowardly in the face of such a threat. we should definitely be strong, we should definitely do sanctions, and we have to show some strength. i mean, putin has eaten obama s lunch, therefore our lunch, for a long period of time. now he says he s open to lifting our sanctions on russia if we can all just get along, which is never going to happen because russia is ruled by an autocrat. if we lift the sanctions, russia will pull trump s puppet strings even more. he also seems to like to kiss putin s ass, mouth, and dick he doesn t criticize russia at all, and staunchly defends them against other criticisms and revelations.here s his stance back in 2014:in other words, this is another position on which he s flip-flopped. he just says whatever his strongest manhandlers want him to say. whether they re his supporters, or foreign powers hoping to use him for their own gain, he says whatever he thinks will win him the most points.featured image by spencer platt via getty images",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.125,5.884285714285717,5.6000000000000005,0.0,0.0

"watch: gop chair says ‘people don’t care’ about trump’s treatment of women, gets destroyed by fox host","well you really have to hand it to trump. now that he s destroyed every establishment candidate, the gop is left with him as the presumptive nominee. although some in the gop establishment continue to kick and scream at the thought of the billionaire businessman being crowned the new king of the party, many are now coming to grips and even defending the demagogue in public and that s quite hard to do given trump s rhetoric and history.in a sign that the gop is surrendering to the new face of the gop, republican national committee chairman reince priebus defended trump, even going as far as saying that people just don t care about trump s alleged terrible treatment of women.watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jebxw2lzjwy]during an interview, fox host chris wallace asked priebus about a new york times report that found repeated instances of trump insulting women and making unwanted advances even in the workplace. priebus response was odd given that he is the rnc chair. he said, well, you know, a lot of things bother me. and obviously, i m the wrong person to be asking that particular question. wallace quickly pounced on the chairman, saying, wait a minute, why are you the wrong person? you re the chairman of the party. this is your nominee, and they re saying he has mistreated women. priebus response was ridiculous. he said: people just don t care. i think people look at donald trump and hillary clinton and say, who is going to bring an earthquake to washington, d.c.? i don t think donald trump and his personal life is something that people are looking at and saying, wow, i m surprised that he s had girlfriends. that s not what people look at. chris wallace quickly interjected saying: whoa, forgive me, sir. it s not whether or not he had girlfriends. the question is whether or not he mistreated women, whether he made unwanted advances, whether he humiliated women in the workplace. it s disturbing to see that the republican moral compass is non-existent. they would rather support a sexist megalomaniac who disrespects women and minorities than say the truth: donald trump is not the right choice to be president of the united states.featured image via video screenshot.",1,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.310588235294119,6.800000000000001,0.0,0.0
german leftist uses nudity on facebook to fight back against “right-wing” news outlets exposing truth about muslim “refugees”,"***warning*** image is not appropriate for all ages.how very progressive a german photographer has started a campaign to have right wing propaganda censored on facebook, but pornographic images of women allowed. he s calling it nipples instead of incitement. photographer olli waldhauer kicked off his campaign by posting an image on facebook of a topless woman stood beside a man holding a placard with racist slogan written on it. one of these people is against the rules of facebook, reads the slogan on the image.moderators deleted the image after 21 minutes. good people, i had to change my profile. facebook did not come clear with the amount of friend requests. thank you for your feedback and support, wrote mr waldhauer on his page afterwards. what madness from a small image can be everything. thank you all! always remember #nippleinsteadbaiting! he added later.mr waldhauer is now encouraging his follower to download the image and post it on their own pages, in the hope of pressuring facebook moderators in the spirit of the #freethenipple campaign.the #freethenipple campaign aims to end the discriminatory banning of female breasts on social media, and so stop men finding breasts attractive by exposing them more often (according to their logic).from his social media profile, mr waldhauer appears to be strongly in favor of mass migration, and has previous started a campaign labeled #iamnotaterrorist to challenge animosity towards migrants from the middle east.perhaps mr. waldhauer s time and effort would be better spent focusing on the muslim caliphate taking place in his country and not on those trying to spread the truth about these refugees. his dream of censoring political debate on facebook is less outlandish. in september german chancellor angela merkel said she wanted more facebook to filtering hateful and racial posts. journalists overheard the comments as she conversed with facebook ceo mark zuckerberg at a un summit. via: breitbart",1,18,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.063333333333333,13.866666666666669,0.05555555555555555,0.0
"trump outlines plans for first day in office, meets with cabinet hopefuls","new york/washington (reuters) - u.s. president-elect donald trump outlined plans on monday for his first day in office, including withdrawing from a major trade accord and investigating abuses of work visa programs, and met with cabinet hopefuls at his manhattan office tower. trump met with oklahoma governor mary fallin, democratic u.s. representative tulsi gabbard and former texas governor rick perry. but he announced no further appointments, keeping candidates and the public guessing about the shape of the administration that will take office on jan. 20. fallin, gabbard and perry were the latest of dozens of officials who have made their way across the opulent lobby of trump tower for talks with the republican president-elect in a relatively open - and unconventional - transition process since his election victory on nov. 8. trump, who has not held a news conference since his election, issued a video on monday evening outlining some of his plans for his first day in office, including formally declaring his intent to withdraw from the trans-pacific partnership, or tpp, trade deal, which he called “a potential disaster for our country.” the 12-nation tpp is democratic president barack obama’s signature trade initiative and was signed by the united states earlier this year but has not been ratified by the u.s. senate. the president-elect said he would replace the accord with bilaterally negotiated trade deals that would “bring jobs and industry back onto american shores.” “my agenda will be based on a simple core principle: putting america first. whether it’s producing steel, building cars or curing disease, i want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here on our great homeland, america, creating wealth and jobs for american workers,” he said. japanese prime minister shinzo abe said on monday the tpp “would be meaningless without the united states.” trump said he would cancel some restrictions on producing energy in the united states on his first day in office, particularly shale oil and “clean coal,” which he said would create “many millions of high-paying jobs.” he promised to direct the labor department to investigate abuses of visa programs for immigrant workers. the main u.s. visa program for technology workers could face tough scrutiny under trump and his proposed attorney general, u.s. senator jeff sessions, a longtime critic of the program. trump had made eliminating regulations and withdrawing from the tpp central to his campaign, but he sent mixed signals during the campaign about his views on visa programs including the main h-1b visa for high-tech industry workers. trump has so far picked two cabinet members and three top white house advisers, but aides said he was not expected to make further announcements on monday. “they could come this week, they could come today, but we’re not in a rush to publish names,” kellyanne conway, a senior adviser, told reporters. “we’ve got to get it right.” trump spoke often with reporters camped out at his new jersey golf course over the weekend, but has not held a traditional news conference to talk about his priorities. he held an off-the-record meeting with a group of television anchors and executives on monday afternoon and was scheduled to meet with print media representatives on tuesday. the washington post reported that four participants at monday’s meeting described it as a contentious but generally respectful session. they told the post that trump singled out reporting of his campaign by cnn and nbc that he considered to be unfair. trump also returned to twitter on monday night, saying “many people” would like to see brexit campaigner nigel farage as british ambassador to the united states. “he would do a great job!” farage, who helped lead the successful referendum fight for britain to leave the european union, spoke at a trump rally during the u.s. campaign and visited the president-elect after his victory. trump’s first meeting on monday was with iraq war veteran gabbard, a representative from hawaii who backed u.s. senator bernie sanders in his unsuccessful 2016 democratic presidential nominating contest against hillary clinton. the “frank and positive” discussion focused on the war in syria, counterterrorism and other foreign policy issues, gabbard said in a statement. she did not say whether a cabinet role was part of the discussion. gabbard has veered from democratic party positions at times, backing policies cracking down on immigration to the united states by muslims. fallin told reporters she was not offered a position but discussed “a wide range of topics” with trump. the republican governor’s spokesman said that included a focus on the interior department, an agency whose responsibilities include oversight of oil and gas leases on public lands. former republican u.s senator scott brown of massachusetts told reporters he had a “great” meeting about veterans’ issues with trump. trump also met with former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich and elaine chao, the u.s. labor secretary under former president george w. bush, advisers said. trump’s transition team said perry, the former texas governor, was being considered for cabinet posts including defense, energy and veterans affairs. trump, a new york businessman who has never previously held public office and who was the surprise winner over clinton this month, has so far named senior leaders of his national security and law enforcement teams. in addition to sessions, they are u.s. representative mike pompeo of kansas as cia director, and retired army lieutenant general michael flynn as white house national security adviser. for thanksgiving, trump planned to travel on tuesday to mar-a-lago, a golf resort he owns in florida, a spokesman

"china, pakistan to look at including afghanistan in $57 billion economic corridor","beijing (reuters) - china and pakistan will look at extending their $57 billion china-pakistan economic corridor to afghanistan, chinese foreign minister wang yi said on tuesday, part of china s ambitious belt and road plan linking china with asia, europe and beyond. china has tried to position itself as a helpful party to promote talks between pakistan and afghanistan, both uneasy neighbors ever since pakistan s independence in 1947. their ties have been poisoned in recent years by afghan accusations that pakistan is supporting taliban insurgents fighting the u.s.-backed kabul in order to limit the influence of its old rival, india, in afghanistan. pakistan denies that and says it wants to see a peaceful, stable afghanistan. speaking after the first trilateral meeting between the foreign ministers of china, pakistan and afghanistan, wang said china hoped the economic corridor could benefit the whole region and act as an impetus for development. afghanistan has urgent need to develop and improve people s lives and hopes it can join inter-connectivity initiatives, wang told reporters, as he announced that pakistan and afghanistan had agreed to mend their strained relations. so china and pakistan are willing to look at with afghanistan, on the basis of win-win, mutually beneficial principles, using an appropriate means to extend the china-pakistan economic corridor to afghanistan, he added. how that could happen needs the three countries to reach a gradual consensus, tackling easier, smaller projects first, wang said, without giving details. pakistani foreign minister khawaja asif said his country and china were iron brothers , but did not directly mention the prospect of afghanistan joining the corridor. the successful implementation of cpec (china-pakistan economic corridor) projects will serve as a model for enhancing connectivity and cooperation through similar projects with neighboring countries, including afghanistan, iran and with central and west asia, he said. india has looked askance at the project as parts of it run through pakistan-administered kashmir that india considers its own territory, though wang said the plan had nothing to do with territorial disputes. china has sought to bring kabul and islamabad together partly due to chinese fears about the spread of islamist militancy from pakistan and afghanistan to the unrest-prone far western chinese region of xinjiang. as such, china has pushed for pakistan and afghanistan to improve their own ties so they can better tackle the violence in their respective countries, and has also tried to broker peace talks with afghan taliban militants, to limited effect. a tentative talks process collapsed in 2015. wang said china fully supported peace talks between the afghan government and taliban and would continue to provide necessary facilitation . the belt and road infrastructure drive aims to build a modern-day silk road connecting china to economies in southeast and central asia by land and the middle east and europe by sea.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.656666666666666,21.46666666666667,0.0,0.0
"in macau, skipping the casinos, but embracing the past - the new york times","as we bumped along in the no. 25 bus on estrada do istmo, it was impossible not to notice the venetian macau, a mountain of steel and glass, shining in the distance in the afternoon sun. opened in 2007, it’s home to one of the largest casinos on earth. and it’s not alone: of the 10 biggest casinos in the world in 2014 (based on revenue) a staggering eight were in macau, a tiny region on the southern coast of china, where over half a million people are packed into fewer than 12 square miles. but i wasn’t there to gamble. following a precedent i’d established in my very first frugal traveler column, when i toured las vegas without going to the famed strip, i was determined to break the shell of macau’s opulent exterior and see what lay beneath the surface. during a quick trip, taking the ferry across the pearl river estuary, i found it was the perfect place for a getaway from the noise and intense urban compactness of hong kong. owing to its colonial past, macau, with its cobblestone streets, old catholic churches and narrow alleyways, has an almost european feel to it, along with an interesting local cuisine that fuses portuguese and chinese flavors. and my focus, naturally, was putting this trip together without causing undue strain on my budget. macau was one of the first asian settlements to be forced into the yoke of european colonization and the last to shed it, achieving full independence from portugal in 1999. as with hong kong, china administers macau but employs a somewhat approach. there are no visa requirements for americans staying in macau fewer than 30 days (you will need to bring your passport). the turbojet ferry ride from hong kong (150 to 200 hong kong dollars for an economy fare, about $20 to $25) is reasonably quick and comfortable. ferries leave from various spots in hong kong regularly, so if you miss one, there’s no need to worry. (be more cautious when you’re leaving macau — it’s easier to end up on the wrong ferry.) my attack plan was simple: to see as much as i could, by foot and by public transportation. macau is traditionally divided into three sections: the peninsula and the islands of coloane and taipa. (a fourth “region” of land reclaimed from the ocean, cotai, now connects coloane and taipa and is the home to many of the newer casinos.) i particularly had my eye on rustic coloane village in the south. though i had no plans to indulge in the casinos, one lesson i’ve learned in my travels is that where there’s gambling, cheap rooms follow — it’s how they lure you in. i was able to land a very comfortable, relatively luxurious room at the sofitel on the western side of the peninsula for 650 hong kong dollars, a little over $80. close to the center of the city, it was an ideal point. i was able to check another essential off the list by walking to yin he dian xun (roughly, galaxy telecommunications) and purchasing a sim card from a very helpful young woman for 50 macanese patacas (about $6). ah, yes, the currency. the macanese pataca and hong kong dollar are separate currencies but virtually interchangeable in macau. change will sometimes come in patacas, sometimes in hong kong dollars. a dollar is, however, slightly more valuable than a pataca. if you’re considering making a big souvenir purchase (like gold or jade jewelry, which is plentiful on the main drag of avenida de almeida ribeiro) either use a credit card with no foreign transaction fee, or walk into a bank to exchange for patacas — i was able to do both without difficulty. senado square, within walking distance of my hotel, was a good place to begin exploring. beautiful old yellow and pink pastel buildings with arched doorways and green shuttered windows frame the historic square, which is paved with small tiles. it was a perfect place to stroll and enjoy the egg tart i’d purchased for 9 dollars from koi kei bakery. the egg tart is one of macau’s signature delicacies, a local interpretation of the portuguese pastel de nata — perfectly creamy custard with a pleasantly caramelized top, encased within a delicate, flaky pastry cup. another distinctive item is the pork chop bun. i stopped into the celebrated tai lei loi kei, a nearly macanese chain, and paid 48 dollars for a small, pork chop that had been slapped somewhat unceremoniously onto a buttered white roll. fortunately the meat was simply seasoned and well cooked (just be careful not to break a tooth). in addition to its cuisine, macau has memorable architecture. catholic influence is still very much present, at least aesthetically. st. dominic’s church, a beautifully restored, structure, is free to enter, as is a art museum housed in the church’s bell tower. i looked over the icons and relics of the church on display, including beautiful old wooden carvings. other worthy architectural attractions include the ruins of st. paul, a grand stone facade that is one of the few remaining pieces of a complex. while there, i made the steep hike up to the adjacent fortaleza do monte, which provided an excellent view of the city. i could walk to the ruins and st. dominic’s from my hotel, but despite macau’s compact size, not everything is walkable. i would not recommend driving in macau, nor riding one of the city’s ubiquitous scooters. i found a bike rental shop called si toi in taipa that charged 20 dollars per hour (only $2. 50, remember) but i ultimately decided on the bus: i found it cheap and fairly reliable. unless you have something called a macaupass (which i did not, and purchase locations are annoyingly scarce) you will need coins. lots of coins. and they don’t make change on the buses, so get used to walking around with a pocketful of patacas. (local businesses and banks can help you make change if you’re hard up.) i hopped the 26a bus to coloane, eager to see the rustic, more peaceful side of macau. (a quick note on signage: every official sign in macau will be in both portuguese and chinese. i found this somewhat curious, as i didn’t hear a word of portuguese my entire stay. i asked neal, a server at the cute cafe cheri, if he spoke portuguese or knew anyone who did. “well,” he hesitated, “no, not really. ” did anyone in macau speak portuguese? “yes, i think in some restaurants. ”) coloane village was quiet, almost sleepy, when i hopped off the bus by the roundabout near eanes park. it was, in other words, exactly what i was seeking. i began walking north up the coast, stopping for another excellent egg tart at lord stow’s bakery. colorfully painted houses stood on stilts in the bay, china a mere 1, 000 feet to the west. fishermen hung their catch outside their homes, and every now and then there was the distinctive clack of tiles. i wound my way down avenida de cinco de outubro, in the shade of ficus rumphii trees with aerial roots, like banyan trees. i eventually found myself in a beautiful cobblestone plaza with a fountain on one end and the beautiful, bright yellow chapel of st. francis on the other. i dined al fresco at cafe nga tim on a dish of rice and curried prawns and watched evening set in. the casinos? didn’t need them. they do provide a useful benefit, though: when it came time to head back to the ferry terminal, i happily used the hotel’s free shuttle bus.",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.726153846153846,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0

"sprint, oneweb say 8,000 jobs announced by trump are part of softbank pledge","palm beach, fla. (reuters) - u.s. president-elect donald trump on wednesday said telecommunications group sprint corp (s.n) and a u.s. satellite company oneweb will bring 8,000 jobs to the united states, and the companies said the positions were part of a previously disclosed pledge by japan’s softbank group corp. softbank (9984.t) holds stakes in both companies and its chief, billionaire businessman masayoshi son, earlier in december said he would invest $50 billion in the united states and create 50,000 jobs. sprint in january said it had cut 2,500 jobs as part of its plan to cut $2.5 billion in costs. on wednesday it said it would create 5,000 jobs in areas including sales and customer care by the end of its fiscal year ending in march 2018. sprint spokesman dave tovar said the jobs were part of the pledge made by son but would be funded by sprint. softbank and oneweb had announced on dec. 19 that the japanese company was leading a $1.2 billion funding round. oneweb plans to use the funds to build a plant in florida to produce low-cost satellites, creating almost 3,000 jobs at the company and its suppliers. softbank described its $1 billion share of the funding as the first tranche of the $50 billion promised by son in a meeting with trump. it is not clear whether the $50 billion softbank investment would be part of a $100 billion tech investment fund that the head of softbank and saudi arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had announced earlier in the year. “i was just called by the head people at sprint and they are going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the united states, they are taking them from other countries,” trump told reporters outside his mar-a-lago estate in florida. “and also oneweb, a new company, is going to be hiring 3,000 people. so that’s very exciting,” he added. shares of sprint corp, which is 82 percent owned by softbank, were barely changed in after-hours trading.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.0953846153846136,5.2,0.0,0.0

"bank of england: eu, not uk, has most to lose from brexit","the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, has told mps that leaving the european union (eu) is not the biggest threat to financial stability in britain, and that brexit actually poses a bigger risk to the continent than it does to the uk. [he said “i am not saying there are not financial stability risks in the uk … but there are greater short term risks on the continent in the transition than there are in the uk” reports the daily telegraph. this constitutes a substantial for the goldman sachs alumnus, who argued during that referendum that voting to leave the eu could hit growth and tip the country into a technical recession. following the vote, however, the uk economy has performed strongly. growth in the construction, services, and manufacturing sectors are at and highs, respectively, according to the purchasing managers indices (pmis) for each sector. pmis are among the leading indicators for the economic health of a country. ewen stewart, a director at the global britain think tank and leading scottish economist, welcomed carney’s apparent change of heart, telling breitbart london he was “baffled” by the central bank’s gloomy forecasts. “the risks of brexit do indeed lie with the eu and not the uk … because of the inherent contradictions within the eurozone,” he confirmed. “the eu have far more to lose than the uk, especially as it becomes ever more apparent that the uk is well positioned to strike free trade deals with the us, australia, and other regions. ” andrew haldane, the bank of england’s chief economist, has described the bank’s inaccurate forecasts as a “michael fish” moment, recalling the bbc weatherman’s infamous dismissal of a hurricane prediction hours before the great storm of 1987 struck britain. richard tice, of the leave means leave campaign, told breitbart london that carney was simply “catching up with what we brexiteers knew all along”. “the uk will thrive, we have the upper hand and nothing to fear. he should offer to resign given his woeful forecasting track record. ”",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.823333333333334,4.800000000000001,0.08333333333333333,0.0
justice department antitrust nominee makan delrahim's hearing delayed,"washington (reuters) - the confirmation testimony expected on wednesday for makan delrahim, who was nominated to head u.s. justice department’s antitrust division, has been delayed by missing paperwork, senator charles grassley said in a hearing. delrahim is a member of president donald trump’s transition team. “i’m disappointed we couldn’t go forward with mr. delrahim’s hearing this morning. we are still waiting on one piece of paperwork, which we understood we’d have by now. and i imagine that will be transmitted to us within another day or two, and we look forward to including him on our next hearing,” grassley told the senate judiciary committee. grassley, an iowa republican who chairs the committee, did not say which paperwork was missing. senator amy klobuchar, a democrat from minnesota, called the missing document a “snag.” delrahim was expected to move to the justice department after finishing up in the white house counsel’s office, where he worked to steer supreme court justice neil gorsuch through the senate confirmation process. the senate must vote to confirm delrahim. as the proposed chief of the antitrust division, delrahim would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making. former president barack obama’s administration faced a large number of megadeals in what one enforcer called a “merger tsunami” and blocked many of them. before going to work at the white house after trump’s inauguration in january, delrahim was a lobbyist with the law firm brownstein hyatt farber schreck, llp. one client in 2016 was health insurer anthem inc, which this year lost a court fight with the justice department over whether it would be allowed to merge with cigna. anthem has appealed the loss.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.080000000000002,18.2,0.0,0.0
ukraine wants un to label russia as a sponsor of terrorism,"ukraine wants the united nations to brand russia a terrorism sponsor amid bloody clashes between pro-russian separatists and ukrainian government troops. the ukrainian ambassador to the un told fox news he plans to submit a draft resolution asking the un general assembly to formally label “russia as a sponsor of terrorism."" ambassador yuriy sergeyev gave no timetable for when he would present the resolution to the un. he said government officials in kiev are working on the text. sergeyev told fox news the resolution will mirror the ukrainian parliament’s declaration this week, designating the moscow-backed separatists in east ukraine as a terrorist group. kiev believes that by defining the separatists as terrorists it eliminates any notion that it would engage in peace talks with them. sergeyev warned of a “huge war” if the separatists take more territory or build a corridor to southern ukraine’s crimean peninsula, which russia annexed almost a year ago. ukraine and the west accuse russia of backing the rebels with troops and weapons, which russia denies. meanwhile, artillery fire killed at least 12 civilians in the main rebel stronghold of donetsk on friday amid fierce fighting between pro-russia separatists and government troops as hopes for a break in hostilities were dashed when an attempt to call a new round of peace talks failed. five people were killed as they were waiting for humanitarian aid outside a community center and two people were killed in the same neighborhood when a mortar shell landed near a bus stop. by the time an associated press journalist arrived at the community center, the bodies were taken away. nearby trees were cut down by what could have been a projectile. five other people died friday in sporadic artillery fire in the west of donetsk. full-blown fighting between the russian-backed separatists and government forces erupted anew earlier this month following a period of relative tranquility. fox news' jonathan wachtel and the associated press contributed to this report",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0
iraq builds up forces south of kurdish oil export pipeline: security sources,"baghdad (reuters) - iraqi forces are deploying tanks and artillery south of a kurdish-held area of northern iraq where a section of a kurdish oil export pipeline is located, security sources said on monday. the buildup is taking place northwest of mosul, an official from the kurdistan regional government s (krg) security council said by phone from the kurdish capital, erbil. an iraqi government security advisor said the fish-khabur area, northwest of mosul, is the location of crossings into turkey and syria that baghdad wants to bring under its control. but he declined to say if a military move was being prepared. a pipeline carrying crude across iraqi kurdistan connects to a metering station in fish-khabur before feeding another pipeline that takes the crude to the turkish mediterranean coast for exports. the military buildup is taking place around rabi a, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the fish-khabur, the kurdish security official said. turkey and iran both support measures taken by the iraqi government to isolate the krg after it held a referendum on kurdish independence on sept. 25 and to bring the kurdistan region s oil exports and land crossings under baghdad s authority. iraq has shown zero signs of de-escalating, said a statement by the krg security council about the deployment, adding that units being brought to the region include iranian-backed popular mobilisation paramilitaries. the fish-khabur crossing has been under kurdish control since 1991, when the united states and western powers imposed a no-fly zone over northern iraq to protect the kurds from saddam hussein s army. the syrian side of the border in the region is now under the control of u.s.-backed syrian kurdish forces.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.740000000000002,8.133333333333335,0.0,0.0
rubio says he regrets getting personal with donald trump,"washington (reuters) - republican presidential candidate marco rubio voiced regret on wednesday about making personal attacks against front-runner donald trump, a strategy that has failed to slow the new york billionaire’s momentum.rubio, trump, ohio governor john kasich and u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, the four remaining republican presidential candidates, participated in a round of fox news-sponsored town hall events a day before they meet for another debate on thursday in miami. rubio, whose campaign is fighting for survival after a series of disappointing performances in nominating contests for the nov. 8 election, has drawn fire for a line of attack in recent weeks in which he got personal with trump. he called him a con artist and said among other things that he had small hands, a charge that trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood. until rubio got personal, the u.s. senator from florida had largely stayed above the fray and had focused his assault on trump from a policy standpoint. he told fox news’ “the kelly file” that if he had to do it over again, he would handle the issue differently. “my kids were embarrassed by it. my wife didn’t like it. i don’t think it reflects good. that’s not who i am. that’s not what my campaign is going to be about or will ever be about again,” rubio said. “i’d do it differently – on the personal stuff. i’m not telling you he didn’t deserve it, but that’s not who i am and that’s not what i want to be,” he added. rubio, 44, fared poorly when michigan, mississippi, idaho and hawaii voted on tuesday. he needs to win his home state of florida next tuesday or face calls for him to exit the race. he said opinion polls showing him lagging far behind trump in florida were not accurate. “the fact of the matter is the only poll that counts is the one they’ll take on tuesday when they count the votes that these people are going to cast and we’re going to win in florida,” he said. cruz, 45, looking to emerge as the main trump alternative should rubio and kasich falter, said he would keep the focus of the campaign on substantive issues. “i don’t have any views on donald trump’s anatomy,” cruz said at his fox news town hall. kasich, at his fox news town hall, said he believed he had a path forward if he wins his home state of ohio on tuesday, but that it involved a convention fight when republicans gather to officially pick their nominee in cleveland in july. a contested convention would result if trump, 69, does not win the required 1,237 delegates, forcing delegates to decide whether to back him at the convention or find a consensus candidate such as kasich, 63. president gerald ford and challenger ronald reagan staged a spirited nomination fight at the 1976 republican national convention, but no republican convention has gone beyond a single ballot since thomas dewey’s third-ballot win in 1948. trump, who has come under withering attack by mainstream republicans for his statements on muslims, illegal immigrants and trade policy, said at his fox news town hall he had attracted many new voters to the republican party with his crossover appeal. he said establishment republicans would be risking the energy he had brought to the race by trying to prevent him from winning. “they would be so foolish to throw it away,” he told host sean hannity.

peru's kuczynski acknowledges having advised odebrecht project,"lima (reuters) - peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski acknowledged that he worked as a financial adviser for an irrigation project owned by the brazilian builder odebrecht [odbes.ul] on saturday, contradicting his previous denials of having any links to the company. odebrecht is at the center of latin america s biggest graft scandal and has admitted to paying about $30 million in bribes to secure contracts in peru over a decade. kuczynski worked in the cabinet of former president alejandro toledo, who prosecutors say took a $20 million bribe from odebrecht during his 2001-2006 term. however, kuczynski has not been named as a suspect in the far-reaching graft probe by the attorney general s office. in a televised interview with local broadcaster rpp, kuczynski denied being a partner in an investment fund that allegedly had links to odebrecht. however, he said he had worked as a financial adviser for several companies that needed to raise funds for big projects, including an odebrecht firm. they use bankers, said kuczynski, a 79-year-old former wall street banker elected president in 2016. i ve been a banker, in new york, for a very prestigious bank. i ve been one of the founders of what s called project financing. so sometimes, i was hired. for h2olmos, an irrigation project. odebrecht owns h2olmos sa, which was formed in 2009 to build and operate one of its landmark projects in peru - carving a 20-kilometer (12-mile) tunnel through the andes to transport water to irrigate agricultural fields in the desert. kuczynski s comments could provide more ammunition for the opposition-controlled congress as it targets him in its probe into odebrecht s links to politicians. kuczynski had previously denied reports in local media that odebrecht hired him as an adviser a decade ago to mend ties with him after he opposed highway contracts awarded to the company in toledo s government. kuczynski did not provide additional details about his work for h2olmos, and his office did not respond to requests for comment. however, he stressed in the interview that the advising work was done when he was a private citizen and denied favoring any company while in public office. odebrecht reached a deal to sell h2olmos to brookfield infrastructure partners lp and suez sa a year ago. however, the sale has not closed. while the attorney general s office reopened a preliminary probe related to odebrecht and kuczynski a year ago, it has not accused kuczynski of wrongdoing.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,15.797142857142859,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0
lebanon's president rejects terrorism suggestion,"beirut (reuters) - the lebanese president appeared to defend hezbollah as necessary to resist israel on monday, after an arab league statement accused the group of terrorism and noted it is part of lebanon s coalition government. israeli targeting still continues and it is the right of the lebanese to resist it and foil its plans by all available means, president michel aoun s office quoted him as saying in a tweet. the heavily armed shi ite muslim hezbollah, formed by iran s revolutionary guards, fought israel s occupation of lebanon in the early 1980s and says its weapons are still needed against israel. saudi arabia, a regional rival of iran, opposes hezbollah s role as a military force in syria and has accused it of helping the houthi group in yemen and militants in bahrain. the arab league met on sunday to discuss what it called iranian interference in arab countries, and accused tehran s ally hezbollah of terrorism. aoun said that lebanon could not accept suggestions that its government was a partner in acts of terrorism, another tweet quoted him as saying after meeting arab league secretary general ahmed aboul gheit in beirut. aboul gheit said in beirut that nobody was accusing lebanon s government of terrorism or wanted to harm lebanon. one of the ruling partners is accused of this...it is an indirect means of asking the lebanese state to talk to this partner and convince them to restrain their acts on arab land, he said. everyone acknowledges the particularity of the lebanese situation. lebanon faces a political crisis after its prime minister saad al-hariri suddenly resigned on nov. 4 in a statement broadcast from saudi arabia. his resignation statement accused iran and hezbollah of sowing strife in arab countries.",0,5,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,21.76000000000001,34.0,0.0,0.0
u.n. secretary general complains that the ‘masses have rejected globalism’ in favor of nationalism,"u.n. secretary general complains that the ‘masses have rejected globalism’ in favor of nationalism antonio guterres, elected in october to take over as u.n. secretary general next year, told a conference in his native lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in europe this year. he said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas. 22, 2016 the incoming head of the united nations warned on tuesday that ‘losers of globalization’ in rich countries have felt ignored by establishment politicians, prompting them to turn to nationalist agendas, as in the u.s. election and brexit referendum. “therefore wait ye upon me, saith the lord, until the day that i rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that i may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” zephaniah 3:8 (kjv) editor’s note: the bible clearly says that god’s desire is to “gather all the nations of the world together”, in order to “pour his fury” upon them. the united nations, something unique in world history, has been created by the will of god, and things are going to end exactly how the bible says they will end. all muslims will be driven out of israel as prophesied in zechariah 14:21 (kjv), israel will expand its borders to cover the size of the original land grant to abraham , and jesus will rule the world from jerusalem . and that will be the “new” world order. antonio guterres, elected in october to take over as u.n. secretary general next year , told a conference in his native lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in europe this year. he said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas. antonio guterres formally elected as un chief: europe has struggled to handle a huge influx of refugees, many of whom displaced by the war in syria. the united states has accepted only a very small number of refugees and may take in even fewer next year. “in 2016, we have witnessed a dramatic deterioration of that international protection regime (for refugees),” guterres said. “this example started in the developed world, it started essentially in europe, it is spreading now like a virus into other parts of the world.” guterres, who was u.n. high commissioner for refugees until last year, linked the growing resistance to accepting refugees to wider concerns about globalism. “i don’t think we can look strictly at the refugee issue, i think the problem is a broader problem,” he told the conference on europe’s refugee crisis. there was a consensus in the mid-1990s that globalization would benefit all, he said. “but a lot of people were left behind … in the developed world, (there are) those who have been losers in globalization,” he said. “the recent analysis of the rust belt in the united states, i think, is a clear demonstration of that, when we speak about the elections.” donald trump won this month’s election in the united states in part thanks to support from voters who have seen their jobs lost to countries with cheaper labor. “so globalization has not been as successful as we had hoped and lots of people became not only angry with it, but feeling that political establishments and international organizations are not paying attention, were not taking care (of them),” he said. this led to what he called “a kind of evolution” in which anti-establishment parties now tended to win elections and referendums tended to attract majorities against whatever was put to a vote. source share this article",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,15.15571428571429,17.02857142857143,0.0,0.0
sound in atlantic not from missing argentine submarine: navy spokesman,"mar del plata, argentina/buenos aires (reuters) - a sound detected on monday in the south atlantic, near where an argentine navy submarine with 44 crew went missing five days ago, is not believed to have come from the ill-fated vessel, a navy spokesman said. the sound detected by probes initially raised hopes that crew members aboard the ara san juan submarine, which disappeared after reporting an electrical malfunction, may have been intentionally making noise to attract rescuers. but an analysis by argentine authorities, on the fourth day of a search-and-rescue mission, showed that it was highly unlikely it had come from the german-built submarine, navy spokesman enrique balbi told reporters in buenos aires. it does not correspond to a pattern that would be consistent with bangs against the walls in morse code, balbi said. he described whatever had been detected as a continuous, constant sound. the disappointment followed another letdown earlier in the day, when the navy said satellite calls detected over the weekend did not in fact come from the vessel. (tmsnrt.rs/2zq8hgz) the vessel reported an electrical problem and was headed back to its base in the port of mar del plata when it disappeared on wednesday, the navy said. storms have complicated search efforts as relatives wait anxiously. more than a dozen boats and aircraft from argentina, the united states, britain, chile and brazil have joined the search effort. authorities have mainly been scanning the sea from the sky, as storms have made it difficult for boats. the navy said on monday night that two boats belonging to french oil company total sa, which has offshore operations in argentina, arrived at the patagonian port of comodoro rivadavia to transport rescue equipment the u.s. navy brought to the country, including a remote-operated vehicle, a mini-submarine, and a submarine rescue chamber. gabriel galeazzi, a naval commander, told reporters that the submarine had come up from the depths and reported the unspecified electrical malfunction before it disappeared nearly 300 miles off the coast. the submarine surfaced and reported a malfunction, which is why its ground command ordered it to return to its naval base at mar del plata, he said. the malfunction did not necessarily cause an emergency, galeazzi added. the craft was navigating normally, underwater, at a speed of five knots toward mar del plata when it was last heard from, he said. a warship has a lot of backup systems, to allow it to move from one to another when there is a breakdown, galeazzi said. one of the crew is argentina s first female submarine officer, eliana maria krawczyk, 35, who joined the navy in 2004 and rose to become the master-at-arms aboard the ara san juan. the families of crew members have gathered at the mar del plata naval base awaiting news. they were joined on monday by president mauricio macri. we continue to deploy all available national and international resources, to find the submarine, macri said on twitter. intermittent satellite communications were detected on saturday and the government had said they were likely to have come from the submarine. but the ara san juan sent its last signal on wednesday, according to balbi. the calls that were detected did not correspond to the satellite phone of the submarine san juan, he said on monday, adding that the craft had oxygen for seven days. after that, he said, it would have to surface or get near the surface to replenish air supply. the ara san juan was inaugurated in 1983, making it the newest of the three submarines in the navy s fleet. built in germany, it underwent maintenance in 2008 in argentina. that maintenance included the replacement of its four diesel engines and its electric propeller engines, according to specialist publication jane s sentinel.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.73,16.0,0.0,0.0
reset: vladimir putin says that russia is ready to do it’s part to rebuild ties with america under trump,"reset: vladimir putin says that russia is ready to do it’s part to rebuild ties with america under trump vladimir putin earlier became one of the first world leaders to congratulate trump via a telegram for his surprise triumph over hillary clinton. russian president vladimir putin on wednesday said moscow is ready to contribute to rebuilding relations with the united states with donald trump as president. editor’s note: since hillary clinton’s and barack obama’s failed “russian reset” back in 2009, international relations between russia and the united states have been a chilly 5 or 6 degrees above freezing. for the past year and a half, russia and america have not talked at all, with russia assuming power in the middle east in syria. just hours after donald trump’s historic electoral college landslide, vladimir putin has extended the olive branch of friendship and it could not have come at a better time. “we have heard the pre-election statements by then-candidate trump, which were directed at rebuilding relations between russia and the us,” putin said during a speech before several ambassadors in the kremlin. “we understand that this will not be an easy path considering the unfortunate degradation of relations,” he said. “but russia is ready and wants to restore full-fledged relations with the us.”“we are ready to do our part and do everything to return (us-russian) relations to the trajectory of development,” he said. “this would be in the interest of russian and american people and would positively affect the general climate in international relations, considering the special responsibility of russia and the us for ensuring global stability and security.” remember this unqualified disaster? secretary of state hillary clinton spearheaded the disastrous “russian reset” back in march of 2009 which only served to further damage relations with russia. they couldn’t even spell the words on the thing properly. with reporters looking on, clinton met lavrov and handed him a gift – a green box tied in green ribbon. he unwrapped it to reveal a “ reset button ” a lighthearted reminder of vice president joe biden’s recent remark that the administration of us president barack obama is hitting the reset button with russia after years of friction during the bush administration. the trouble was , the russian-language label the americans put on top of the button had the wrong word. before she realised the mistake, clinton assured lavrov her staff had “worked hard” to get it right. was it right? she inquired with a smile. “you got it wrong,” lavrov responded, also smiling. he said the word the americans chose –“peregruzka”– meant “overloaded” or “overcharged” rather than “reset”. clinton quickly retorted with: “well, we won’t let you do that to us, i promise”. it was an embarrassment for the united states, to say the very least. russian foreign minister sergey lavrov wants people to stop asking him about the failed “reset” with russia because he says “it was the invention of hillary clinton and obama administration.” putin earlier became one of the first world leaders to congratulate trump via a telegram for his surprise triumph over hillary clinton. putin has tacitly supported trump during the campaign, while trump repeatedly flattered and praised the russian leader and said he was willing to work with him. russia’s parliament on wednesday broke into applause upon learning of trump’s win, and russian markets climbed up, against the global slump on the news. source share this article",1,19,0.0,0,0,0,0.047619047619047616,10.451578947368422,9.705263157894738,0.0,0.0

russia has been reading the art of war - blake franko,"the national interest last week, the new york times ran a news story on inflatable jets and missile launchers being added to the kremlin’s arsenal. using balloons as weapons of war may sound strange and lead one to think moscow has concocted a novel method of war. upon deeper analysis, what the russians are doing is nothing particularly new. the british and american military famously employed inflatable tanks in world war ii in order to deceive the germans. the serbs more recently used decoys during the intervention in the balkans to trick nato bomber pilots. the method to this inflatable madness is based on well-established military thinking, going all the way back to ancient china. to get a better sense of what the russians are doing and how they understand warfare, one only needs to pick up a copy of sun tzu’s art of war . “warfare is the way (tao) of deception. thus although [you are] capable, display incapability to them. when committing to employ your forces, feign inactivity. when [your objective] is nearby, make it appear to be distant; when far away, create the illusion of being nearby.” this line from sun tzu is especially important in russian military thinking of recent years. the kremlin’s use of misinformation in the media is a particularly obvious example of deception, but the actual movement of men and material is just as important—especially to nations sharing a border with russia. moscow is intent on ensuring the west that russian troops can mass at a moments notice and be rapidly deployed to far-flung corners of the country. russia could inject itself into numerous theaters on its periphery and beyond, including the baltic states with the threat of little green men, to continued military drills with china in the south china sea to the risk of rekindling war in nagorno-karabakh . all of these scenarios prove irksome for policy makers in washington. dealing with rapidly deployable troops, that have the ability to stoke conflicts thousands of miles apart, makes deciphering the kremlin’s actions a frustrating ordeal. “probe them to know where they have excess, where an insufficiency.” nato pilots have been working overtime to deal with frequent russian incursions into allied airspace. the most recent incident occurred only two weeks ago, in which norway, the united kingdom, france and spain scrambled aircraft to confront russian tu-160 bombers flying near their territory. russia’s high-profile encounters, including a very close flyby of a u.s. navy ship and barrel rolling over an american reconnaissance aircraft, clearly demonstrates that it is trying to determine how and in which ways nato will respond. these actions aim to keep allied forces on their toes, judging reaction times and what assets are used to counter their forces. “thus one who excels at moving the enemy deploys in a configuration (hsing) to which the enemy must respond. he offers something that the enemy must seize. with profit he moves them, with the foundation he awaits them.” the russians are very fond of this method, which is usually characterized by instigating incidents in order to execute their so-called reflexive control . this concept focuses on creating international incidents and forcing others to react them, in which the only plausible outcome is usually in favor of the kremlin. the most notable case of this logic was applied in russia’s entry into the syrian civil war. although moscow’s intervention has had its pitfalls, largely driven by having to work with troublesome allies in tehran and damascus, it has made itself the primary external actor in the country. the slow american response to the syrian war allowed moscow to enter the fray and change the reality on the ground. in doing so, the momentum of the conflict swung in favor of the russian-led coalition with president assad’s grip on power secured. whether the west likes it or not, the russians will now be part of the peace process. calls by france and the united states to investigate russia’s bombing campaign as a war crime will not change this reality. the end result is that the russian-led coalition is setting the pace in the conflict, with washington and the west struggling to keep up. these selected passages from the art of war help shed light on the kremlin’s calculus. a strong case can be made that the russian are employing these means in order to maximize the effectiveness of their armed forces in the face materially stronger opponents like the nato alliance. although these deceit-based tactics are signs of weakness, it does not make their use any less dangerous. if one is to believe moscow is undermining the american-led world order, forcing nato to continually be on alert is certainly resource draining and creates domestic pressure through the questioning of the alliance’s worth and purpose. while putin may not be a grand strategist—given the hardships russia faces through its own actions—he has been doing his homework on war. in order to avoid direct conflict with moscow and better understand its methods, policy makers would be wise to read up on its approach to war and tactics they are likely to employ. blake franko is an assistant editor at the national interest.",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.650000000000002,4.0,0.0,0.0

peru's kuczynski dares congress to dismiss entire cabinet,"lima (reuters) - the government of peru s president pedro pablo kuczynski told opposition lawmakers on wednesday that they would have to dismiss the entire cabinet - and move closer to facing removal themselves - if they try to oust a second education minister. kuczynski accused the opposition-ruled congress of trying to sabotage his education reforms as the right-wing popular force party prepared a motion to censure education minister marilu martens over her handling of a teachers strike that dragged on for two months. the president said ousting martens would be completely unfair. it would be the second education minister censured and purely over political preferences, kuczynski said. by turning the censure vote on martens into a vote of confidence on his whole cabinet, kuczynski hopes to check popular force s ability to threaten his ministers. the president can dissolve congress if it dismisses the cabinet twice. congress has already forced kuczynski s former education and finance ministers to resign, while his ex-transportation minister quit to avoid a censure vote. popular force lawmakers said they would study the request for a vote of confidence on the cabinet and noted they had not yet formally presented the censure motion for martens - a sign they might back off. they re putting the governability of the country at risk over one minister? said luz salgado, an influential lawmaker with popular force, which controls congress. it s completely irresponsible. the gamble could force kuczynski, a former wall street banker, to appoint 19 new ministers as he tries to revive the economy and his slipping popularity in opinion polls. however, it might also give him a freer hand to govern during the remaining four years of his term. a prime minister has not challenged congress to renew its confidence in a cabinet in decades, said political analyst fernando tuesta, underscoring how rapidly relations between the executive branch and congress have deteriorated in kuczynski s year-old government. kuczynski took office last year after narrowly beating long-time favorite keiko fujimori, the eldest daughter of jailed former leader alberto fujimori. kuczynski s party won less than 15 percent of congressional seats while fujimori s party, popular force, won an absolute majority.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.605000000000004,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
ted cruz victory shows gop's impossible conundrum (+video),"the wisconsin gop primary suggests that, no matter what the republicans do from here on out, they will anger some major faction of a fractured party. ted cruz accomplished what he set out to do in the wisconsin republican primary: beat front-runner donald trump soundly, winning most of the state’s delegates and raising the probability of a contested gop convention in july. but senator cruz’s big victory – he beat mr. trump by 13 points, 48 percent to 35 percent – doesn’t prove that he is “uniting the republican party,” as he claimed in his victory speech tuesday night. it merely demonstrates that the texas senator is consolidating his role as the “anti-trump” in a presidential nomination race that has plunged the gop into crisis. the wisconsin exit polls tell the story. “more than half of cruz’s supporters, and two-thirds of [ohio gov.] john kasich’s, said they were ‘scared’ of what trump would do in the white house – a remarkable rejection of the leading candidate in the race,” write analysts for abc news. “notably, among cruz’s own voters, only a quarter were excited about what he’d do as president – further suggesting that he garnered substantial anti-trump, not necessarily, pro-cruz, support.” governor kasich underperformed in wisconsin with only 14 percent of the vote, but he remains adamant about taking his campaign to the convention as the only “mainstream” republican still in the race. the effect, though, has been to split the anti-trump vote. perhaps more troubling for the gop were responses to how wisconsin republicans would vote in the general election. if trump is the party’s nominee against democrat hillary clinton, only 61 percent of gop primary voters said they would vote for him; 19 percent said they would vote for a third-party candidate, 10 percent said they would vote for mrs. clinton, and 8 percent said “no one.” if it’s cruz vs. clinton in november, only 66 percent of wisconsin republicans said they’d back cruz; 18 percent said they’d vote third party, 6 percent said clinton, and 6 percent said “no one.” these numbers are similar to national polling that shows a deep divide within the gop between trump supporters and republican voters who oppose him. it’s also true that, inevitably, as election day nears, many unhappy voters will surely end up holding their nose and voting for their party’s nominee anyway. clinton, in particular, inspires revulsion among many republicans. but trump is no mere republican candidate. the brash billionaire inspires rock-solid loyalty among a third of the gop electorate, including the first-time voters he has lured into the process with his populist, nativist message. if trump is not the nominee, many of his supporters say, they will abandon the party altogether – especially if they believe trump is treated unfairly at the convention. on the issue of “fairness,” one exit poll question was particularly devastating to the republican establishment: if no one wins a majority of the delegates before the convention, whom should the party nominate? voters were asked. a majority, 55 percent, said “the candidate with the most votes in the primaries.” only 43 percent said “the candidate who the delegates think would be the best nominee.” “in all likelihood, donald trump will go to the convention with the most delegates. wisconsin doesn’t really change that,” says matthew kerbel, chairman of the political science department at villanova university in philadelphia. if trump arrives at the convention without a majority of the delegates, then it becomes easier to deny him the nomination. “but the cost of denying him is to split the party,” says professor kerbel. “and the cost of not denying him is it becomes his party, and donald trump becomes the face of the party.” that could have a profound impact on other republicans on the ballot. among general election voters, trump has sky-high negatives. cruz and clinton also have high negatives – but not close to trump’s. kasich argues he’s the most electable, and general election matchups bear that out, but his path to the nomination through a contested convention is impossibly narrow. he’ll need to convince a deadlocked convention that a candidate who finished at the back of the pack deserves to jump the line. his argument is “electability” – polls do show him performing better than trump or cruz against clinton. but tuesday’s exit polls showed electability held little sway with voters. the next test comes in two weeks with the new york primary – home turf for both trump and clinton, who, like trump, needs to overcome an embarrassing defeat in wisconsin. clinton’s 13-point loss to bernie sanders – 56 to 43 percent – was nevertheless expected. wisconsin’s electorate is largely white, and very liberal, both playing to the vermont senator’s strengths. trump also wasn’t a good fit for wisconsin, both demographically and culturally. before wisconsin, new york polls showed both trump and clinton well ahead of their top competitors. if either underperforms, it will be clear that wisconsin was a turning point. both will be damaged, but still on track to head to their respective conventions with the most delegates. the math, at this stage in the race, is almost impossible to overcome.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.605000000000004,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0

a martian looks at election day,"by lambert strether by lambert strether of corrente . tomorrow, election day will be only one week away. in this post i want to talk about two distinct subjects. first, i want to talk about the sort of calculation that a martian might make when confronted by the choice we will face in the voting booth. then, i’d like to paint a brief picture of what election day would look like, in a world where i didn’t want to claw out my eyeballs. a martian looks at election outcomes in 2016 i say “martian,” because a martian is so detached that the 30,000-foot view looks like a close-up, and i think in this election detachment is a virtue (see above at “claw out my eyeballs”). so a martian would feel that despite the all the sound and fury, the numbers have not been that crazy (assuming one trusts them). among registered voters: emphasizing how remarkably stable the &#39;16 race has been — going back to sept. 2015 https://t.co/odfykkim8m pic.twitter.com/2ckus9qi9g &mdash; mark murray (@mmurraypolitics) october 31, 2016 realclearpolitics has a similar chart averaging all the polls with a vertical scale that makes the swings a lot bigger. to me, the pattern of the race is that clinton starts out with, and retains, a natural institutional advantage of around four points. again from the head-to-head rcp chart, trump has closed and then pulled even six times: september 2015, december 2015, february 2016, may 2016, july 2016, and september 2016. and each time either clinton’s institutional advantages have re-asserted themselves, or trump has shot himself in the foot (take your pick). trump is closing now. can he pull ahead and close the deal? unknown. based on past performance, no. then again, as i remarked before the latest email eruption, “a week is a long time in politics,” wikileaks has yet to drop its final shoe, and each campaign probably has a garbage truck full of oppo fired up and ready to go. paradoxically, martians are not warlike, since the thin air, small population, and harsh conditions on mars make war a species-threatening event. for the same reason, martians prize the deep memories of elders while treating every child as precious. and martians resist “marsization,” because the one time there actually was a single, mars-wide, cosmopolitan class of elite overlords they tried to invade the earth, and who knows where that would have led! so if you were a martian, and you believed that clinton’s election would lead to a new war , and you believe that endorsing bowles-simpson and “hemispheric trade” in a speech at goldman sachs mean a grand bargain and tpp passage respectively, then you might look askance at a likely clinton victory. what do do? if you had a martian friend who followed american elections obsessively — this is similar to southeast asian countries where people obsessively follow english premier league football — this is what your friend might tell you: the last thing you want is for clinton to be able to enact her (real, private) agenda. sure, she might make some small good changes, but if you throw war, a grand bargain, and the surrender of national sovereignty with another so-called trade deal on one side of the scale, it’s hard to see what outweighs them on the other, at least in terms of concrete material benefits.[1] so, working on the assumption that clinton will win, what you need is: a republican house . here, the checks and balances built into the american system favor gridlock, and gridlock is your friend, since little legislation will get passed. whether the house republicans impeach clinton if the senate is in democrat hands is an open question, but with clinton having privatized the email server for her public office and the shenanigans at the clinton foundation , the clinton administration will provide a target-rich environment. i woudn’t put it past them to try to take clinton’s security clearance away! a democrat senate . the emergence of left(ish) party barons with independent power bases is the untold story of election 2016. warren is at least sound on banksters and financial power, and sanders, while not a bolshevik, is well to the left of the democrat mainstream. that’s a good thing. both are prolific fundraisers who don’t need the dnc. if the republicans hold the senate, the tendency will be for democrats to stick together. if the democrats do, then baron warren and baron sanders (and allies like sherrod brown ) will feel more free to drag the party left. a close race . if clinton wins, she’ll claim a mandate if the margin is a tenth of a percent. but in the same way that anybody can print money, but the trick is getting other people to accept it, others will be less likely to accept her claim the closer the result is. (i think the result would have to be better than the four points obama beat romney by — 51.1% to 47.2% — and as of today, clinton’s margin is 2.8% in rcp’s four-way average .) of course, bush claimed a mandate in 2004, too — true story: i managed to google-bomb “bush mandate” to mandate magazine, back in the day when google-bombing wasn’t hard — and proceeded to try to gut social security, whereupon the democrats promptly gutted him and went on to win the 2006 mid-terms. but why make it easy? so, that’s the martian perspective on the race. surprisingly or not, the personal characteristics of puny earthling candidates are not a factor! nor are cultural or class markers! elections on mars here is how election day works on mars. again because of planetary and cultural characteristics, martians reserve tricky and complex electronic devices for important things, like distributed martian parallel chess, or space operas. they are also convivial, and they hate to be manipulated by large and opaque forces (that time the jovians invaded). obviously, i can’t provide links for most of this — the uniform resource locator is a global standard, not an interplanetary one — but in short form: 1. on mars, election day is a national holiday. that’s because martians, unlike american earthlings, think that everybody should have an equal opportunity to vote. voting is equally easy for almost every martian, whether they work or not. 2. the martians use hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public. this is remarkably similar to international standards on earth (which the united states does not use): last march, the country’s highest court found that secret, computerized vote counting was unconstitutional. unfortunately, the country was germany, and the constitution violated by e-voting systems was the one that the u.s. wrote and insisted germans ratify as part of their terms of surrender following wwii. paul lehto, a u.s. election attorney and constitutional rights expert, summarized the german court’s unambiguous, landmark finding : “no ‘specialized technical knowledge’ can be required of citizens to vote or to monitor vote counts.” there is a “constitutional requirement of a publicly observed count.” “[t]he government substitution of its own check or what we’d probably call an ‘audit’ is no substitute at all for public observation.” “a paper trail simply does not suffice to meet the above standards. “as a result of these principles,…’all independent observers’ conclude that ‘electronic voting machines are totally banned in germany’ because no conceivable computerized voting system can cast and count votes that meet the twin requirements of…being both ‘observable’ and also not requiring specialized technical knowledge. hand-counting paper ballots is no good at all, argue critics, unless you really want to know who the actual winner of the election was… after the verdict in the case — filed by a computer expert and his political scientist son — lehto wondered how it could be that open, observable democracy is seemingly an inviolable right for “conquered nazis,” but not, apparently, for citizens of the united states… 3. the martians throw a big party at the precinct after the paper ballots have all been hand-counted. that’s partly because martians are convivial, but also because the martians think that democracy is important and ought to be celebrated. (again, because the martian population is small, they wish to begin the conciliation process between winner and loser immediately, lest fratricidal violence result, and there’s no better way to do that than over food.) 4. the martians regulate all forms of political advertising for size (small) and frequency (not often), whether for candidates or policies. that’s because the martians wish to minimize manipulatio by encouraging face-to-face forms of persuasion and deliberation in public venues wherever possible. 5. the martians ban published polling data thirty days before the election. that’s because martians believe that they each should vote for their own reasons, and that elections (unlike markets) are not (manipulative) beauty contests. conclusions crazy martians! what are they thinking? notes [1] sadly, the time for an all-out assault on republican “obstructionism” was 2009, when all the stars had aligned: the republicans had no credibility, and the democrats had the house, the senate, the most powerful orator of our time (so it was said), in the white house, and a mandate for “hope and change.” of course, obama (assuming good faith) squandered this opportunity, starting with his inaugural speech, if not before. appendix and then there’s evan mcmullin, doing well in utah . i haven’t seen any actual evidence that he’s mitt romney’s straw in case of some kinda electoral college debacle…. 0 0 0 0 0 0",1,6,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.450000000000003,9.066666666666668,0.0,0.0

checks for free: a mexican plan to combat poverty,"mexico city (reuters) - an opposition alliance in mexico wants to launch a universal basic wage to combat the poverty that blights the lives of almost half the population, touting an experimental reform discussed globally as a solution to job losses from automation. the center-right national action party and center-left party of the democratic revolution are running on a joint ticket with the leftist citizens movement (mc) for next july s presidential election, and the income plan is a key part of their manifesto. officials inside the alliance say details of the plan are still being worked out, though its contours are emerging. a basic income of 10,000 pesos ($537) per year for everyone, including children, could be provided by consolidating funds from federal, state and municipal welfare programs, jorge alvarez, an mc congressman working on the plan told reuters in a recent interview. if you multiply that by four or five, which is the typical size of a mexican family, you get an annual income of 40,000 to 50,000 pesos per family, alvarez said, adding that providing the income to children could be conditional on school enrollment. home to the richest man in latin america, carlos slim, mexico is laden with oil and minerals, boasts a large manufacturing base and has the world s 15th biggest economy. but poverty has remained stubbornly stuck above 40 percent of the population for decades. government social development agency coneval defines poverty as a person living on no more than 2,925 pesos a month in cities and 1,892 pesos in rural areas. the agency also takes into account other factors like healthcare and education. getting to 40,000 or 50,000 pesos per family could be achieved without increasing taxes, alvarez said. still, the organization for economic cooperation and development argues that providing an unconditional basic income to everyone of working age would do little to combat poverty if not funded by extra taxes. the idea of universal basic income has gained currency due to the increasing robotization of the workforce. finland is running a pilot project to test whether unconditional payments could serve as a plausible alternative welfare model. mexico has seen job growth in recent years thanks to a manufacturing boom, and could face a smaller workforce as robots take over more tasks. swiss voters rejected a basic income plan in a referendum last year, while the defeated socialist candidate in france s presidential election this year, benoit hamon, championed it, saying it would be funded by a tax on robots that replace human labor. mexican gross domestic product was worth $1.046 trillion in 2016, according to the world bank, but some 53.4 million mexicans, or 43.6 percent of the population, live below the poverty line, according to coneval.

qatar says no sign arab states willing to negotiate over boycott,"doha (reuters) - qatar s foreign minister said on wednesday that his country was willing to negotiate an end to a gulf diplomatic rift but had seen no sign that saudi arabia and other countries imposing sanctions on doha were open to mediation. kuwait and the united states are trying to heal a bitter dispute between qatar and four arab countries that has damaged business ties and disrupted travel for thousands of citizens in the six-nation gulf cooperation council. egypt, saudi arabia, bahrain and the united emirates severed political and trade ties with the small gas-rich country on june 4, accusing it of supporting terrorism. doha denies the charges. a visit this week to the uae and qatar by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov showed no signs of having eased tensions among the gulf arab powers. qatar maintains its position that this crisis can only be achieved through a constructive dialogue ... but the blockading counties are not responding to any efforts being conducted by kuwait or other friendly countries, qatari foreign minister sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al-thani told reporters in doha on wednesday at a news conference with his russian counterpart. the uae s ambassador to the united states, yousef al-otaiba, in an interview with u.s.-based magazine the atlantic on monday, said his country would negotiate with qatar so long as doha did not set any preconditions for talks. sheikh mohammed said on wednesday qatar planned to bolster trade with russia, one of the world s biggest gas exporters, and that qatar could no longer rely on neighboring states to support its economy or guarantee food security. lavrov said if face-to-face negotiations started, russia would be ready to contribute to the mediation and that it was in russia s interest for the gcc to be united and strong .",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.081818181818182,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0

kerry encouraged by colombia peace talks after havana meeting,"havana (reuters) - u.s. secretary of state john kerry was encouraged by progress in the colombian peace process after meeting on monday in havana with representatives of colombia’s marxist farc guerrilla group and the bogota government, a state department spokesman said. kerry, in cuba as part of u.s. president barack obama’s historic visit to the communist-run island, met the two sides separately and called for them to redouble their efforts to resolve the remaining issues in the talks, spokesman mark toner said in a statement. kerry told both sides he was “encouraged that the ‘end of conflict’ issues are now front and center in the negotiations, including a formal bilateral ceasefire monitored by the u.n. security council, a timetable for disarmament, and security guarantees post-conflict for all lawful political actors,” according to the statement. his involvement at the request of colombian president juan manuel santos marked the first time a u.s. secretary of state had met with negotiators from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia since peace talks started in havana more than three years ago. the meeting between the colombian government delegation and kerry was “very productive,” lead government negotiator humberto de la calle told journalists. “there were extraordinarily concrete elements,” de la calle said. “for example, the announcement of help from the united states relating to the security of people who lay down arms, which is a critical subject at the talks.” the farc thanked the u.s. for its support of the peace talks and said they hope to reach a final peace agreement in the coming months. “on a not-distant date we will give good news to the country and the world - that colombia has reached peace,” the rebel group said in a statement on its website. last year, the two sides agreed a march 23 deadline for a final accord, but negotiators have said a deal by that date now looks unlikely. washington designated the farc a foreign terrorist organization in 1997, and many of its leaders have been indicted in the united states on charges of cocaine trafficking. the united states sees the colombian peace talks hosted by cuba as an example of how restoring normal relations with havana can help it achieve its wider goals in latin america. the colombian war is the region’s longest-running conflict, with some 220,000 people killed and millions of others displaced since 1964.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.831111111111113,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0
what does trump’s executive order against obamacare actually do? - the new york times,"donald j. trump ran on a campaign promise to dismantle the affordable care act. so it should not come as a surprise that he has signed an executive order urging his administration to fight it as much as possible. but that order, alone, won’t allow president trump to unwind the sprawling health law known as obamacare. mr. trump and republican leaders in congress are engaged in negotiations about legislation that might substantially undo or replace the health law. even before the inauguration, congress took a first step toward gutting major provisions. but as that process underscores, major changes to health policy will require new legislation. the trump executive order should be seen more as a mission statement, and less as a monarchical edict that can instantly change the law. mr. trump has sent a strong signal that he intends to fight the health law, but he sent signals that were strong on the campaign trail, too, just in less legalistic language. and the order, crucially, notes that agencies can act only “to the maximum extent permitted by law. ” (how the trump administration interprets those permissions, of course, is yet untested.) the order spells out the various ways that a trump administration might fight the parts of the health law until new legislation comes: by writing new regulations and exercising discretion where allowed. regulations can be changed, but, as the order notes, only through a legal process of “notice and comment” that can take months or years. on matters of discretion, the administration can move faster, but there are limited places where current law gives the administration much power to quickly change course. how much of the order is bluster and how much it signals a set of significant policy changes in the pipeline is unclear. the order was not specific and did not direct any particular actions. “right off the bat, what do they do — something incredibly cryptic that nobody understands,” said rodney whitlock, a vice president of m. l. strategies, a washington consulting firm. mr. whitlock was a longtime health policy aide to senator chuck grassley, a republican from iowa. the easiest way for the trump administration to undermine the health law would be to stop defending a lawsuit brought by the house of representatives. that suit said that the obama administration lacked the authority to pay certain obamacare subsidies. a lower court ruled for the house, meaning that by simply withdrawing from the appeal, the trump administration could start a process to eliminate those subsidies and cause a collapse of the insurance market. mr. trump’s order said nothing about that policy choice. another important area of discretion has to do with exemptions to the law’s unpopular individual mandate to obtain insurance. under the law, all americans who can afford it are expected to obtain health insurance, unless they have experienced some hardship that would make it impossible. people who feel there has been such a hardship can apply for an exemption, and employees in the department of health and human services and the internal revenue service can decide on their case. under a trump administration, it might become easier to claim hardship and get out of the requirement to buy insurance. but people seeking those exemptions will still have to apply for them, in writing, and can do so only at particular times of the year. current law requires them to provide documentation supporting their claim that they have recently filed for bankruptcy, for example, or been evicted, and they must legally attest to their honesty. the trump administration could create new categories of hardship, but that would take time. and rules that effectively eliminate the requirement would almost certainly result in litigation. “it’s not a hardship to have to comply with the law, almost by definition,” said timothy jost, a professor of law at washington and lee university. mr. jost, who supports the health law, has examined the underlying regulations in detail. defanging the individual mandate could have significant consequences for the individual insurance markets. if fewer healthy people buy insurance, the costs of insuring everyone else will rise, leading insurance companies to raise prices or flee the market. last week, the congressional budget office published its estimate of what would happen under a law that eliminated the mandate and some other provisions: 18 million people would lose their insurance next year alone. it’s possible that insurers will look at the language of the order and get skittish, setting off a market collapse next year. but the order itself doesn’t yet change any rules. the health and human services department and the i. r. s. will have to take further action. “is this mostly a symbolic gesture or a signal that they intend to take apart the law piece by piece to the extent they can?” said larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation, a health research group. “at a minimum, this creates a lot of uncertainty for insurers at a pretty critical time. ” the order directs the administration to give states more autonomy in directing health policy. and there’s a clear mechanism for that: medicaid law provides a process in which states can waive many of the program’s usual rules to attempt “demonstration projects. ” administrations have latitude under the law to decide what sort of new programs qualify. mr. trump’s selection for the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, seema verma, has been an innovator in pushing this process in more conservative directions. her selection, even more than the order, was a sign that the trump administration would become more open to new medicaid rules, including possible work requirements to obtain coverage, or premiums even for very poor americans. but, as with the exemptions, there is still a process for such policy changes. states must submit detailed applications for waivers for the rules, and there is a legal review process that typically takes months. mr. trump recently promised that his team was developing a health care plan far better than the affordable care act, that would insure more people and lower their costs. for people who heard that and thought mr. trump had gone soft on obamacare, his executive order may come as a shock. but nothing in the order changes the law on its own. whether mr. trump’s intention is a

u.s. top court denies bid to block mercury air pollution rule,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. supreme court sided with the obama administration on thursday in rebuffing a bid by 20 states to halt an environmental protection agency rule to curb emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from power plants. the action came about a month after the high court put on hold federal regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, the centerpiece of president barack obama’s strategy to combat climate change. chief justice john roberts denied a petition made last week by the states, led by michigan, to put the rule on hold after a federal appeals court decided in december to leave it intact while the epa reassessed costs of implementing the regulation. the states had argued that a stay was necessary because the supreme court had “already held that the finding on which the rule rests is unlawful and beyond the epa’s statutory authority.” the supreme court ruled last june that the epa should have considered compliance costs when it decided to limit emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants mainly from coal-fired power plants, and returned the case to the appeals court. the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit subsequently said the regulations could remain in place while the government responds to the high court’s june ruling. the appeals court gave the epa until april 15 to come up with compliance costs. the epa rule, which went into effect last april, applies to about 1,400 electricity-generating units at 600 power plants. many are already in compliance. epa spokeswoman melissa harrison said the agency was “very pleased” with roberts’ action, noting that power plants are the largest source of mercury pollution in the united states. “these practical and achievable standards cut harmful pollution from power plants, saving thousands of lives each year and preventing heart and asthma attacks,” harrison said. environmental groups and 15 other states that had asked the court to reject the stay request applauded roberts’ action and called on the attorneys general in the group of states led by michigan to end their legal challenge to the rule. the rule is “safeguarding millions of american children from poisons such as mercury, arsenic and acid gases,” said vickie patton, general counsel for the environmental defense fund anti-pollution advocacy group, a party to the case.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.863636363636363,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
"bangladesh wants 'safe zones' to ease rohingya crisis, but seen unlikely","dhaka (reuters) - bangladesh has proposed creating safe zones run by aid groups for rohingya muslims in myanmar s rakhine state to stop hundreds of thousands of refugees crossing into its territory following a military crackdown. the plan, the latest in a string of ideas floated by dhaka, is unlikely to get much traction in myanmar, where many consider the rohingya community of 1.1 million as illegal immigrants from bangladesh. that will leave bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in the world, with little choice but to open new camps for refugees. dhaka sent the proposal to the myanmar government through the international committee of the red cross to secure three areas in rakhine, home to the rohingya community, suggesting that people displaced by the violence be relocated there under the supervision of an international organization, such as the united nations. the logic of the creation of such zones is that no rohingya can come inside bangladesh, said shahidul haque, bangladesh s foreign secretary, the top civil servant in the foreign ministry. the red cross confirmed that it had passed on the request to myanmar but said that it was a political decision for the two countries to make. a myanmar government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. hundreds of thousands of rohingya have fled to bangladesh, a mostly muslim nation of 160 million, from buddhist-majority myanmar in recent years. the decades-old conflict in rakhine flared most recently on aug. 25, when rohingya insurgents attacked several police posts and an army base. since then, an estimated 270,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh, according to the u.n. high commissioner for refugees, joining more than 400,000 others already living there in cramped makeshift camps since the early 1990s. there are widespread fears that tens of thousands more could try to cross if the violence doesn t abate. recent pictures from the border between the two countries show hundreds of rohingya men, women and children trying to cross over into bangladesh on foot and by boat. the humanitarian crisis next door has left bangladesh scrambling to deal with people that it does not welcome either. in recent days, bangladesh officials have said they plan to go ahead with a controversial plan to develop an isolated, flood-prone island in the bay of bengal to temporarily house tens of thousands of refugees, drawing fresh criticism from the international community. it bowed to pressure on thursday, with government officials saying that dhaka would now make another 1,500 acres (607 hectares) of land available for camps to house refugees near cox s bazar, where many refugees already live as it is near the border with myanmar. they will be given temporary shelter, said kazi abdur rahman, additional deputy commissioner of cox s bazar. but rahman added that the refugees would be fingerprinted and confined to the camp so that they did not mix with the local community. these measures, however, do not offer a long-term solution to the crisis, and dhaka says it is getting little support from its neighbor, which has been accused of trying to engineer ethnic cleansing within its borders. bangladesh officials said they had proposed joint patrolling along the border but did not receive a response from myanmar. earlier this week, bangladesh lodged a protest after it said myanmar had laid landmines near the border between the two countries. myanmar leader aung san suu kyi, a nobel laureate, has come under pressure to halt violence against rohingya. she has said that her government was doing its best to protect everyone in rakhine but did not refer specifically to the rohingya exodus. the solution lies in myanmar. the un hopes that myanmar can address the root causes of the problem, said shinji kubo, head of the united nations high commissioner for refugees in bangladesh. kubo said the bangladesh government was doing its best by accepting the refugees instead of sending them back. bangladesh officials are turning to the international community for help, claiming support from countries such as turkey, which has promised aid. on friday, a malaysian coast guard official said the country will not turn away rohingya muslims and is willing to provide them temporary shelter. but any such voyage would be hazardous for the next few months, because of the annual monsoon. the world community must come forward to help them, not by putting pressure on bangladesh but by putting pressure on myanmar not to resort to these atrocities and violence, said h.t. imam, a senior aide to bangladesh prime minister sheikh hasina. the only solution is to force myanmar to take back their citizens through international pressure. and we are working with our partners on that, imam said. besides the creation of internationally-controlled safe zones in rakhine state, bangladesh has also mooted creating a buffer zone along the border, where the international community could set up camps and provide for the refugees, the officials said. further details of the plan could not be learned. we will give aid agencies access. but we are not interested to give them shelter here. we are already overburdened, said mostafa kamal uddin, bangladesh s home

trump’s approval rating makes shocking change with his own supporters (image),"donald trump likes to whine about any poll that doesn t show him in a favorable light, calling the data biased or dishonest but here s one poll that he cannot ignore.a new politico/morning consult poll covering numbers as recent as march 24-25 shows that trump s approval ratings are plummeting even among his own supporters. trump has been shown to be failing in more balance polls, which is no surprise but to see his support dwindling so quickly among republicans is quite shocking. according to the data, trump s ratings are now as follows: overall, 38 percent of voters strongly disapprove of trump, compared to only 23 percent who strongly approve. to make matters even worse for trump, this national tracking poll had a tendency to lean pro-trump, which made the findings far higher than a more balanced poll like gallup s most recent data, which shows trump s approval rating at a pathetic 38%.it appears as though trump s disastrous failure with the american health care act (trumpcare) had an extremely negative impact on his approval rating, which fell 6% points among his own supporters. the politico/morning consult poll reported: the decline in trump s approval rating was sharper among republicans and independents than among democrats. in the latest survey, 81 percent of republicans and 39 percent of independents approve of the job trump is doing. a week prior, 85 percent of gop voters and 44 percent approved. and among those who self-identified as trump voters last year, the president s approval rating shrunk from 90 percent last week to 84 percent this week. however, it s not just trump s health care debacle that is impacting his numbers so much his russia scandal is also working against him: twenty-nine percent of voters call russia an enemy of the u.s., and 30 percent say it is an unfriendly nation. only 7 percent call russia an ally, and another 22 percent say it s friendly but not an ally. five weeks ago, voters were divided evenly on whether russia was friendly toward the united states. trump was an extremely unpopular president to begin with, and he has failed to redeem or prove himself to the american people. in fact, he hasn t even tried and his supporters are catching on. they ve practically disappeared and seem ashamed to defend him after his corruption, humiliating behavior, and broken campaign promises have come to light. with numbers this pathetic, trump and his policies don t stand a chance.featured image via gage skidmore / flickr",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.07142857142857142,8.009090909090911,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
request to halt construction of dapl declined,"21st century wire says a request by native american tribes seeking to halt the construction of the final link in the highly politicized and controversial dakota access pipeline has been declined by a federal judge in washington dc.the tribes at standing rock and cheyenne river sioux were not successful in claiming that the project will prevent them from conducting religious ceremonies at oahe lake but district court judge james boasberg declined their request citing no imminent harm to the tribes practices could be shown.as noted by rt and ap below, the project is headed up by energy transfer partners, who s representatives argued that this halt in construction request over the issue of preventing tribes religious ceremonies was exceedingly tardy and not construction related. the denial of this request is not coming as a surprise to many who are well aware that the dapl project was more than 90% complete back when obama signed a temporary hold on the project, which could have been largely a political move, leaving this issue for the trump administration to handle. rta federal judge in washington, dc has dismissed a request by a group of native american tribes seeking to stop construction of the final link of the controversial dakota access pipeline.standing rock sioux and cheyenne river sioux tribes claimed the project will prevent them from practicing religious ceremonies at oahe lake which they say is surrounded by sacred ground. district court judge james boasberg stated there was no imminent harm to the tribes religious practices as oil is not flowing through the pipeline yet.the ruling will allow energy transfer partners, the company building the $3.8 billion, 1,170 mile pipeline, to finish the final 1,100ft (335m) connection under lake oahe in north dakota, completing the project.the company s stock rose 0.3 percent after the announcement, according to seeking alpha.boasberg will more thoroughly consider the request at a february 27 hearing, ap reported.the us army corp of engineers filed documents favoring energy transfer partners, having granted the final easement for dapl last tuesday. the corps said that the tribes will have plenty of time to argue their case before the pipeline begins working, thus a work stoppage wasn t warranted.energy transfer partners had argued that the tribes argument that the work threatened their religion was exceedingly tardy and not construction-related, ap reported.the decision allows construction on dapl to continue while the lawsuits against the project to proceed.boasberg previously rejected a request by tribes to block the project in september. however, that ruling was superseded by the obama administration s decision in december to delay construction, pending an environmental review.however, one of president donald trump s first acts in office was to sign a presidential memoranda ordering the removal of obstacles to the construction of both the dakota access pipeline and the keystone xl continue this report at rtread more dapl news at: 21st century wire dapl filessupport our work by subscribing & becoming a member @21wire.tv",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.682857142857145,8.514285714285714,0.0,0.0

breaking udate: iran confirms $1.7 billion was ransom payment for prisoners and not part of “nuclear deal” original story: obama and kerry agree to give iran $1.7 billion u.s. taxpayer dollars as “settlement”,"whiskey tango foxtrot!the united states sent iran $400 million in debt plus $1.3 billion in interest, and the money was disbursed as a ransom payment for four american hostages of the islamic regime, a top iranian commander said wednesday afternoon. therefore, the u.s. paid the iranian regime $425 million dollars per american hostage, according to the commander. the annulment of sanctions against iran s bank sepah and reclaiming of $1.7mln of iran s frozen assets after 36 years showed that the us doesn t understand anything but the language of force, said iranian basij commander brig gen mohammed reza naqdi, addressing his forces in tehran. this money was returned for the freedom of the us spy and it was not related to the (nuclear) negotiations, he claimed, according to state-controlled fars news agency.four americans who were held hostage by the islamic republic washington post reporter jason rezaian, u.s. marine amir hekmati, pastor saeed abedini, and nosratollah khosrawi roudsari (who decided to stay in iran) were part of the deal that included the ransom payment, along with the release of seven iranians who were sitting in american jails on charges of thwarting international sanctions, and the delisting of 14 iranian nationals from interpol s red list, which seeks international criminals for extradition.a fifth american, matthew trevithick, who was imprisoned by tehran, was also released, but under the terms of a separate deal, according to reports.the u.s. state department tells breitbart news that the payment to iran was separate but simultaneous, and not a ransom. we did not pay ransom to secure the return of these americans. the funds that were transferred to iran were part of a separate but simultaneous arrangement we agreed to with iran related to the u.s.-iran claims tribunal at the hague, a state department spokesperson told breitbart news late wednesday.state department spokesman mark toner told reporters earlier on wednesday in washington that no ransom was paid, rejecting the remarks of the iranian commander. there was no bribe, there was no ransom, there was nothing paid to secure the return of these americans who were, by the way, not spies. we ve spoken to this in the days after their release on sunday morning in great detail about how this process worked. there was this consular channel that was opened up to secure their release, toner said. via: breitbart newshere is the question we posed after discovering the interesting timing of this $1.7 billion payment to iran while 4 american prisoners were being simultaneously released:was this transfer of funds to a terrorist state (via the american taxpayer), the real reason the prisoners (hostages) iran was holding were suddenly released? did the incompetent obama-kerry duo use this settlement as a bargaining chip to make it appear as though freeing these hostages was part of the iran nuclear deal all along? this is absolutely sickening the united states and iran on sunday settled a longstanding claim at the hague, releasing to tehran $400 million in funds frozen since 1981 plus $1.3 billion in interest, the state department said.the funds were part of a trust fund once used by iran to purchase military equipment from the united states but which was tied up for decades in litigation at the iran-us claims tribunal.the settlement announcement was made after tehran released five american detainees in a prisoner swap as a nuclear deal was implemented. via: business insider",1,33,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.366893939393943,9.360606060606061,0.0,0.0

"ugly, bloody scenes in san jose as protesters attack trump supporters outside rally","san jose, calif. —protests outside a donald trump rally in downtown san jose spun out of control thursday night when some demonstrators attacked the candidate’s supporters. protesters jumped on cars, pelted trump supporters with eggs and water balloons, snatched signs and stole “make america great” hats off supporters’ heads before burning the hats and snapping selfies with the charred remains. several people were caught on camera punching trump supporters. at least one attacker was arrested, according to cnn, although police did not release much information. “the san jose police department made a few arrests tonight after the donald trump rally,” police said in a statement. “as of this time, we do not have specific information on the arrests made. there has been no significant property damage reported. one officer was assaulted.” in one video circulating widely on social media, two protesters tried to protect a trump supporter as other protesters attacked him and called him names. another video captured a female trump supporter taunting protesters before being surrounded and struck in the face with an egg and water balloons. police eventually cleared the protest, which they called an “unlawful assembly.” the incidents were the latest in a series of increasingly violent altercations between protesters, trump supporters and police at the presumptive republican nominee’s campaign events. a week ago, it was albuquerque descending into chaos as the city was shaken by raucous riots and arrests outside a trump rally. a month earlier it was costa mesa, calif. thursday was san jose’s turn to take center stage in what is quickly becoming a traveling fiasco. before the event, the san jose police department issued a press release saying it “recognizes and respects everyone’s right to express their first amendment [rights], and we will do everything possible to ensure the event is safe for all attendees and surrounding neighborhoods.” as the night unfolded, however, it became clear that the chaos seen at trump campaign stops across the country had found its way to san jose. trump supporters were surrounded and, in several cases, attacked as they left the rally. in one incident captured on camera, a trump supporter was struck hard over the side of the head as he was walking away from a group of protesters. the attack left him with blood streaming down his head and onto his shirt. “i was walking out with a trump sign and he grabbed my trump sign, saying i was like a racist and stuff,” the man told bystanders and local media. “then he followed me, like, spit on me.” the trump supporter said all he had done was chant the candidate’s name before trying to walk away. another trump supporter was also bloodied after being attacked, his shirt torn almost completely off his body. videos circulating on social media showed swirling, furious fights spilling from street corner to street corner, often with no police in sight. marcus dipaola, a freelance photographer following the trump campaign, posted video of someone getting punched violently in the face. reached by phone thursday night, dipaola said the sucker punch happened at 8:08 p.m. just outside the convention center where the trump rally was held. “it wasn’t completely unprovoked,” he said. “the guy with the flag was waving it in front of the victim’s face. the victim kind of pushed the flag out of the way and then walked quickly away. you saw what happened next.” dipaola said he called 911 but was put on hold and so hung up. he said he told one police officer about the beating but was told sjpd “didn’t have the manpower” to intervene. “morons,” he said. “how do you not staff 911 for an event of this size?” dipaola wasn’t the only journalist to condemn the cops’ handling of the protest. many of the protesters were peaceful. some waved mexican flags in an apparent response to trump calling mexican immigrants “rapists.” according to the san jose mercury news, many of the protesters were latinos from east san jose opposed to what they saw as racism from the gop candidate. “we’re here to support latinos, black people; we’re not rapists,” cindy zurita, a 23-year-old student, told the mercury news as she held a sign reading: “mr hate leave my state.” abc reporter tom llamas, however, said that some of the protesters were “throwing up gang signs.” “there were [people] who came to demonstrate & some who just wanted to brawl,” he tweeted, calling it “the most violent demonstrations we’ve seen.” at times, protesters began to fight among themselves. in one instance, two female protesters pleaded for nonviolence while trying to protect a trump supporter from an angry crowd. despite their efforts, someone snatched the trump supporter’s hat. a handful of the bright red “make america great again” hats were set on fire by protesters, who then snapped photos of the scene or hung the charred hats from street signs. some protesters said they were disappointed to see violence undermine their message. “it’s sad to see san jose representing like this,” student martha garcia told the guardian. “trump is the one igniting the hate. you can’t fight fire with fire.” perhaps the most jarring scene was that of a young female trump supporter being attacked by a crowd of protesters. in multiple videos of the incident, the woman initially appeared to be happily posing in her trump football jersey in front of the mostly male protesters, some of whom can be heard whistling and shouting at her. then an anonymous arm rises over the crowd and tosses an egg at the woman, striking her in the head and eliciting howls and laughter from the crowd. a second later, a red water balloon bursts against the woman’s arm. at first, the woman tries to shrug off the attacks, smiling while appearing to reach out toward the mexican flags that some protesters are waving. objects keep crashing into the convention center windows behind her, however, and protesters can be heard screaming expletives at her. suddenly, another projectile strikes her hard in the face. eventually, someone comes to help her and, after she indicates that she is having trouble seeing, she is ushered back inside the convention center. the ugly scenes of violence toward trump supporters thursday appeared to be the inverse of similar incidents earlier in the campaign in which trump protesters, not supporters, were targeted. the sucker punch captured by dipaola, for instance, echoed an incident in march when a 78-year-old trump supporter sucker-punched a protester at a rally in fayetteville, n.c. [trump protester sucker-punched by supporter in brutal video of tucson rally] hillary clinton and bernie sanders’s campaigns both condemned the violence in san jose. john podesta, chairman of hillary clinton for america, tweeted that “violence against supporters of any candidate has no place in this election.” mike casca, sanders’s rapid response director, tweeted that “we cannot stop trump’s violent rhetoric with violence — only peaceful protest in a voting booth can do that.” blame for the attacks circulated almost as rapidly as images of the violence, with trump supporters accusing democrats and members of the media of having a double standard. many liberals, meanwhile, including the democratic mayor of san jose, suggested that trump’s angry and divisive rhetoric made him at least partly responsible for the violence at his events. “at some point donald trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign,” mayor sam liccardo told the associated press, praising the city’s police while adding that “we’re all still holding our breath to see the outcome of this dangerous and explosive situation.” things inside the rally were more subdued — if only slightly. politico reported that one of its journalists was removed from the rally for reporting at the event without the campaign’s permission. trump, meanwhile, was interrupted a handful of times by protesters. responding to clinton’s blistering attack on him earlier in the day, trump attacked her over her email controversy, going so far as to say “hillary clinton has to go to jail.” “she does not look presidential — that i can tell you,” he said, according to bloomberg. “this is not a president. four more years of this stuff and we’re not going to have a country left.”",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.356923076923078,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0
government santa candidate gets another huge endorsement… just in time for christmas,"the usps is drowning in debt, has lost every one of its life-lines and has mismanaged its funds for decades. no worries though, the us postal union is quite certain socialist santa claus will fix everything presidential hopeful sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) won the endorsement of the american postal workers union on thursday, giving the self-described democratic socialist a boost as he seeks more support from organized labor in the democratic primary.apwu represents 200,000 u.s. postal service employees and retirees. it s the second major national union and member of the afl-cio labor federation to endorse sanders over rival and democratic front-runner hillary clinton.sanders stands above all others as a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country, said mark dimondstein, the union s president, in a statement. the endorsement came from the union s 13-member executive board.the united states postal service (usps) lost $5.5 billion last year. that is the eighth annual loss in a row and the third-highest ever. the only silver lining is that the loss was below the red-ink tsunami of $15.9 billion in 2012.why does the federal government deliver the mail? why does it have a monopoly over delivering the mail?admittedly, the postal service is one of the few government programs with actual constitutional warrant. the constitution authorizes congress to establish post offices. and early american politicians rushed to take advantage of their opportunity, creating the post office department in 1792.with politics rather than service as the post office s priority, congress took the next step and approved the private express statutes, which prevented anyone from competing with the government in delivering first-class mail. and uncle sam enforced his monopoly, fining would-be competitors, including celebrated libertarian author lysander spooner.the feds continue to prosecute anyone with the temerity to compete with the usps, even threatening the cub scouts for once offering to deliver christmas cards.believing that americans existed to serve the usps left the system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. in 1971, congress turned the post office department into the semi-independent usps. that removed its direct role in politics, but the usps still is exempt from taxes and regulations, including local parking restrictions. congress retained its control over postal policies and, of course, preserved the system s delivery monopoly.but banning competition could not preserve the postal market. the number of pieces of mail peaked in 2001 and continues to fall despite a rising population. mail pieces dropped from 213 billion in 2006 to 155 billion last year, and the number is expected to decline to 130 billion by 2020. the usps s last profitable year was 2006. since then, losses have run between $2.8 billion and $15.9 billion. the postal service has maxed out its borrowing from uncle sam and missed four retiree program payments. with characteristic understatement, the government accountability office observed, given its financial problems and outlook, usps cannot support its current level of service and operations. the postal unions insist that nothing is wrong at least, nothing that a federal bailout wouldn t solve. they reserve particular ire for the requirement that the usps prefund workers retirement. had this rule not been in place, noted former postmaster general patrick donahoe, the postal service would have earned money last year.but prefunding protects taxpayers. washington s unfunded (government) retirement liability is about $800 billion and growing every year. that no other agency is required to prefund is unfair to taxpayers, not the postal service, since every agency should have to set aside sufficient money to fulfill its financial promises. with the postal service earning too little to pay and with nothing left of its federal credit line, the usps has defaulted four times over the last three years on its mandated contributions.sanders has long been a vocal backer of a robust postal service, particularly during the postal reform debate of recent years. apwu views itself as fighting a battle against postal service privatization, and it counts the vermont senator as perhaps its leading defender.as the postal service bleeds millions in losses mostly due to unique funding mandates placed upon it by congress sanders has staunchly opposed the closure of postal facilities and cuts in postal service, such as saturday delivery. he is also a leading proponent of the concept of postal banking, which would allow post offices to provide small loans and compete with payday lenders. postal banking is a top issue for apwu, and sanders has sought to make it a campaign issue.in his statement, dimondstein noted sanders long history of standing with workers on picket lines, as well as his support for a national $15 per hour minimum wage. sanders spoke at a protest against verizon last month that was held by the communications workers of america union, and he joined a fight for $15 rally outside the u.s. capitol building earlier this week.via: huffington post",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.723333333333333,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0

trump tries to soothe polish-americans' concerns about his nato stance,"chicago (reuters) - republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday sought to allay the concerns of polish-americans who questioned him about his commitment to poland given his tough stance on nato and talk of working with russian president vladimir putin. trump, at a small roundtable meeting with polish-american leaders, heard their concerns about his demand that nato nations bear more of the financial burden of their defense and his words of praise for putin. “as president i will honor poland’s sacrifices for freedom. we’re committed to a strong poland, very committed, totally committed, and a strong eastern europe as a bulwark for freedom and security,” trump said. trump has rattled nato allies and many u.s. national security experts by saying that if elected on nov. 8, he would demand that nato members pay up their defense contributions of 2 percent of gdp or else have to pay for their own security. many nations in the north atlantic treaty organization have lagged in their defense spending, to the frustration of u.s. leaders, but there has never been a move to cut them out of the u.s. security umbrella because of this. in chicago, trump hailed poland as being up to date with its defense contributions. “we want nato to be strong which means we want more nations to follow the example of poland,” trump said. “if all made the same contributions as poland, all our allies would be more secure.” there are an estimated 9.5 million americans of polish descent in the united states, many of them clustered in midwestern states that may play an important role in deciding who wins the election. tim kuzma, president of a group called the polish falcons of america, told reuters that during the small roundtable event trump was asked about whether he would be a strong friend to poland. the message to trump was “would a trump administration support poland?” kuzma said. “would a trump administration honor the commitments to nato? and he was very affirmative that he would and that he believes in a strong nato.”",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.07692307692307693,7.190000000000001,8.0,0.0,0.0

remember this when you talk about standing rock,"donate remember this when you talk about standing rock dan nanamkin during the treaty camp’s confrontation with militarized police force on thursday afternoon. photo by adam alexander johansson. by kelly hayes / yesmagazine.org this piece is very personal because, as an indigenous woman, my analysis is very personal, as is the analysis that my friends on the frontlines have shared with me. we obviously can’t speak for everyone involved, as native beliefs and perspectives are as diverse as the convictions of any people. but as my friends hold strong on the frontlines of standing rock, and i watch transfixed with both pride and worry, we feel the need to say a few things. i’ve been in and out of communication with my friends at standing rock all day. as you might imagine, as much as they don’t want me to worry, it’s pretty hard for them to stay in touch. i asked if there was anything they wanted me to convey on social media, as most of them are maintaining a very limited presence on such platforms. the following is my best effort to summarize what they had to say, and to chime in with a few corresponding thoughts of my own. it is crucial that people recognize that standing rock is part of an ongoing struggle against colonial violence. #nodapl is a front of struggle in a long-erased war against native peoples — a war that has been active since first contact, and waged without interruption. our efforts to survive the conditions of this anti-native society have gone largely unnoticed because white supremacy is the law of the land, and because we, as native people, have been pushed beyond the limits of public consciousness. the fact that we are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than any other group speaks to the fact that native erasure is ubiquitous, both culturally and literally, but pushed from public view. our struggles intersect with numerous others, but are perpetrated with different motives and intentions. anti-blackness, for example, is a performative enforcement of structural power, whereas the violence against us is a matter of pragmatism. the struggle at standing rock is an effort to prevent the construction of a deadly, destructive mechanism, created by greed-driven people with no regard for our lives. it has always been this way. we die, and have died, for the sake of expansion and white wealth, and for the maintenance of both. the harms committed against us have long been relegated to the history books. this erasure has occurred for the sake of both white supremacy and us mythology, such as american exceptionalism. it has also been perpetuated to sustain the comfort of those who benefit from harms committed against us. our struggles have been kept both out of sight and out of mind — easily forgotten by those who aren’t directly impacted. it should be clear to everyone that we are not simply here in those rare moments when others bear witness. to reiterate (what should be obvious): we are not simply here when you see us. we have always been here, fighting for our lives, surviving colonization, and that reality is rarely acknowledged. even people who believe in freedom frequently overlook our issues, as well as the intersections of their issues with our own. it matters that more of the world is bearing witness in this historic moment, but we feel the need to point out that the dialogue around #nodapl has become extremely climate oriented. yes, there is an undeniable connectivity between this front of struggle and the larger fight to combat climate change. we fully recognize that all of humanity is at risk of extinction, whether they realize it or not. but intersectionality does not mean focusing exclusively on the intersections of our respective work. it sometimes means taking a journey well outside the bounds of those intersections. in discussing #nodapl, too few people have started from a place of naming that we have a right to defend our water and our lives, simply because we have a natural right to defend ourselves and our communities. when “climate justice”, in a very broad sense, becomes the center of conversation, our fronts of struggle are often reduced to a staging ground for the messaging of ngos. this is happening far too frequently in public discussion of #nodapl. yes, everyone should be talking about climate change, but you should also be talking about the fact that native communities deserve to survive, because our lives are worth defending in their own right — not simply because “this affects us all.” so when you talk about standing rock, please begin by acknowledging that this pipeline was redirected from an area where it was most likely to impact white people. and please remind people that our people are struggling to survive the violence of colonization on many fronts, and that people shouldn’t simply engage with or retweet such stories when they see a concrete connection to their own issues — or a jumping off point to discuss their own issues. our friends, allies and accomplices should be fighting alongside us because they value our humanity and right to live, in addition to whatever else they believe in. every native at standing rock — every native on this continent — has survived the genocide of a hundred million of our people. that means that every indigenous child born is a victory against colonialism, but we are all born into a fight for our very existence. we need that to be named and centered, which is a courtesy we are rarely afforded. this message is not a condemnation. it’s an ask. we are asking that you help ensure that dialogue around this issue begins with and centers a discussion of anti-native violence and policies, no matter what other connections you might ultimately make, because those discussions simply don’t happen in this country. there obviously aren’t enough people talking about climate change, but there are even fewer people — and let’s be real, far fewer people — discussing the various forms of violence we are up against, and acting in solidarity with us. and while such discussions have always been deserved, we are living in a moment when native water protectors and water warriors have more than earned both acknowledgement and solidarity. so if you have been with us in this fight, we appreciate you. but we are reaching out, right now, in these brave days for our people, and asking that you keep the aforementioned truths front and center as you discuss this effort. this moment is, first and foremost, about native liberation, self determination and native survival. that needs to be centered and celebrated. thanks, k and friends kelly hayes is a direct action trainer and a co-founder of the chicago

tale of two cities: kurdish vote lays bare political divisions,"sulaimaniya, iraq (reuters) - some kurdish leaders describe monday s referendum on independence as a historic chance for the ethnic group to shape its own destiny after decades of oppression. yet there was little enthusiasm for voting in the city of sulaimaniya. no long queues snaked around buildings in early voting as one might expect of a people who have dreamed of their own nation all their lives. only about 30 people were casting their ballots nearly two hours after polling stations opened, and much of sulaimaniya was subdued. the sharp contrast with celebrations in the other major kurdish city of erbil highlighted divisions between the main political parties, suggesting problems ahead for the administration of any future state. some officials in the patriotic union of kurdistan (puk), based in sulaimaniya, have cautioned that the vote could invite trouble from turkey and iran and a referendum should be held at a more appropriate time. those neighboring countries fear independence will encourage their own restive kurdish populations to press for change. the baghdad government says the vote is unconstitutional. iran banned flights to and from kurdistan on sunday, while baghdad asked foreign companies to stop oil trading with kurdistan and demanded that the krg hand over control of its international airports and border posts with iran, turkey and syria. tensions are high between kurdish fighters and iranian-backed shi ite militias. the kurdistan democratic party (kdp) in erbil argues that it is time for the kurds to run their own affairs after many years of persecution at the hands of saddam hussein and others. polling stations opened at 8:00 a.m. (0500 gmt) and should close at 6:00 p.m. final results are expected within 72 hours. the vote, expected to deliver a comfortable yes for independence, is not binding and is meant to give masoud barzani s kdp a mandate to negotiate secession of the oil producing region with baghdad and neighboring states. there were few referendum banners in sulaimaniya urging people to vote. those who did turn out said they would back an independence from iraq. i say yes, yes, yes to a kurdish state. i am from now on the son of a kurdish state, said dirshad ahmed, a writer. like others who voted, he preferred to enjoy the moment instead of asking tough questions about internal kurdish divisions and hostility to the vote from regional powers and the baghdad government. kurdistan has long been plagued by political disunity between barzani s kdp and decades-old rival patriotic union of kurdistan (puk), headed by jalal talabani. it was most recently exacerbated by the extension of barzani s term. the two sides fought a civil war during the 1990s. some sulaimaniya residents kept their distance from the referendum, preferring caution. i will not vote. the referendum is not good. it could be dangerous because of the threat from turkey and iran, said shop owner ali ahmed. the kurds began moving toward semi-autonomy after a u.s.-led invasion toppled saddam hussein, ending what some called genocide against the ethnic group. but friction with baghdad over oil and other issues led the kurds to press harder for independence in a region that has been relatively stable compared to other parts of the country where sectarian blood spilled between sunnis and shi ites. iraq has been struggling to come up with a formula for stability since the fall of saddam. some iraqis have suggested the country should be split into kurdish, sunni and shi ite regions as a way of managing sectarian and ethnic tensions. kamran ahmed, a university economics professor, said at a polling station: we will never again surrender to any arab leader in iraq. he had high hopes for a kurdish state and said iraq could be broken up, the kind of talk that infuriates regional powers and baghdad. if there is a sunni region then that s fine and the same goes for shi ites. if our experiment is successful it could benefit the sunnis and shi ites, he said. at another polling station, kurdish security guard sarbast saeed urged the shi ite-led baghdad government to rein in militias instead of complaining about a kurdish state. they have no right to attack us when they let the militias attack sunnis. give the sunnis their own state, he said. it s that kind of bitterness that all sides will face as the kurds work toward a viable state.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,12.0,0.0,0.0
senate joins house to pass sweeping new health bill,"(reuters) - the u.s. senate voted overwhelmingly on wednesday to support sweeping legislation that will reshape the way the food and drug administration approves new medicines. it will also provide funding for cancer and alzheimer’s research, help fight the opioid epidemic, expand access to mental health treatment and advance research into precision medicine. two years in the making, the 21st century cures act was passed last week by the house of representatives and will now go to president barack obama to sign into law. supporters say it will speed access to new drugs and devices, in part by allowing clinical trials to be designed with fewer patients and cheaper, easier-to-achieve goals. “for the second consecutive year, the senate is sending the president another christmas miracle for his signature,” senator lamar alexander, a republican from tennessee said in a statement. “last year, it was the every student succeeds act, and this time, it’s the 21st century cures act — a bill that will help virtually every american family.” critics of the legislation say it gives massive handouts to the pharmaceutical industry and will lower standards for drug and medical device approvals. “this gift – which 1,300 lobbyists, mostly from pharmaceutical companies, helped sell – comes at the expense of patient safety by undermining requirements for ensuring safe and effective medications and medical devices,” consumer watchdog public citizen said in a statement. democratic senator elizabeth warren was among the handful of senators who voted against the bill, as was independent senator and former democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders. each decried what they described as big handouts to the pharma industry. even so the bill passed 94-5. the house passed it by a vote of 392-26. the $6.3 billion act, sponsored by republican representative fred upton, authorizes $4.8 billion for the national institutes of health and $500 million to the food and drug administration. it also calls for $1 billion over two years to battle the opioid epidemic. on tuesday the drug enforcement administration issued a report showing that in 2014 about 129 people died every day as a result of drug poisoning. of those, 61 percent are opioid or heroin related. “opioids such as heroin and fentanyl - and diverted prescription pain pills - are killing people in this country at a horrifying rate,” acting administrator chuck rosenberg said. “we face a public health crisis of historic proportions.” the bill also calls for $1.8 billion in funding for vice president joseph biden’s cancer moonshot initiative designed to bolster cancer research by reducing bureaucracy and promoting research collaboration. critics note that the money described in the bill must be appropriated by separate funding bills and that the money may ultimately never materialize. yet the changes to the clinical trial process, something long sought by the drug industry, will be set in stone regardless of whether money for the research projects is forthcoming. among those changes: greater prominence will be given to “real world” evidence gathered outside the framework of a randomized, controlled clinical trial, the gold standard for determining whether a drug is safe and effective. such evidence could be much easier for drug companies to collect. “the passing of 21st century cures act is a show of extraordinary bipartisan unity after a divisive election that should be celebrated,” said ellen sigal, chair of the patient advocacy group friends of cancer research. under the act patient input will be formally incorporated into the fda’s drug review process. funding for the act will be offset by reductions in some medicaid payments and through the sale of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve. the white house supports the bill but said earlier it was concerned that draining the petroleum reserve “continues a bad precedent of selling off longer term energy security assets to satisfy near term budget scoring needs.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,2.342222222222226,3.6,0.0,0.0
ammon bundy’s bodyguard sentenced in oregon standoff case,"portland, ore., oct. 26 (upi) — brian cavalier, the personal bodyguard of ammon bundy, on tuesday was sentenced to time served in custody, exactly 9 months, for his role in the 41-day oregon wildlife refuge standoff earlier this year. u.s. district judge anna j. brown delivered the sentence in a downtown portland federal courthouse. “you’ve fulfilled the custody provision of the sentence,” brown told cavalier, who remains under u.s. marshals service custody while awaiting transfer to nevada where he faces federal charges from a 2014 armed standoff. cavalier pleaded guilty on june 29 to one charge of conspiring to prevent federal workers from the bureau of land management and the fish and wildlife service from carrying out official work through intimidation, threat or force, and one charge of possession of a firearm in a federal facility. cavalier will also face three years of post-prison supervision that would begin after or occur concurrently with any supervision ordered by nevada should cavalier be sentenced in that case, the oregonian reports. bundy, his brother ryan bundy, and five others — including cavalier — were charged with conspiracy, while other defendants have been charged with theft of government property and carrying a firearm in a federal facility, oregon public broadcasting reports. the oregon incident began in early january in the town of burns, where protesters were voicing support for ranchers dwight hammond, 73, and his son steven, 46, who were convicted of arson in 2012 and served time in prison but whose sentences a court later ruled were too short. the protesters, led by bundy, would later occupy oregon’s malheur national wildlife refuge in a tense 41-day standoff with federal authorities. bundy is the son of cliven bundy, a nevada rancher who gained international attention in 2014 after staging an armed standoff with federal authorities over a grazing dispute with the bureau of land management. cavalier will stand trial for the 2014 nevada standoff in february. he is the first of the 26 defendants indicted in the oregon conspiracy case.",1,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.130000000000003,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
megyn kelly torches mike huckabee for defending trump’s kkk support (video),"megyn kelly became the only fox news host to take donald trump s endorsement by the kkk seriously when she cornered mike huckabee on monday night.after mitt romney told kelly during an earlier interview that trump is coddling the kkk and their former leader david duke, mike huckabee feigned surprise that the former republican presidential nominee would say such a thing. trump has repeatedly disavowed david duke, disavowed the klan, huckabee claimed.almost immediately, kelly put pressure on huckabee. when did he repeatedly disavow the klan, she demanded to know.huckabee insisted that trump disavowed duke and the kkk on twitter, and further insisted that nobody he knows has ever called trump a racist.but huckabee should probably read trump s twitter feed again because the republican front-runner only weakly disavowed duke and said nothing about disavowing the endorsement of the kkk.as i stated at the press conference on friday regarding david duke- i disavow. pic.twitter.com/oixfkpulz2 donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) february 28, 2016kelly mentioned that it was weird how trump disavowed duke on friday but acted like he had never heard of him during the interview with jake tapper on cnn on sunday, and huckabee could only admit that he couldn t explain it.huckabee then tried to excuse trump s terrible interview by claiming that his earpiece wasn t working, something kelly called him out on swiftly. but trump heard david duke in that ear piece, you know that, because he repeated back, david duke, to jake tapper, she brutally reminded the former arkansas governor.huckabee responded by repeating his assertion that he doesn t believe trump is a racist and went on to trash the kkk as an abominable organization that he can t believe still exists.kelly said that it s hard to believe that trump could fumble on something that is such a no-brainer. political candidates just do not accept endorsements from hate groups like the kkk. such an endorsement is damaging and is usually quickly denounced to protect the image and reputation of the person running for public office.but trump took a long time to finally disavow duke, and it appears he only did so reluctantly.kelly even reminded huckabee of other racist incidents involving trump, the most recent of which occurred when he decrided a judge for being hispanic as the reason why a court ruled against him in a fraud case against trump university. huckabee responded by calling this election silly. here s the video via youtube.kudos to megyn kelly for not joining her fox colleagues in defense of a racist. featured image via video screenshot",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.372727272727271,18.94545454545455,0.0,0.0

u.s. elections may already be in serious jeopardy : acorn gives oh man cigarettes and cash to register to vote 72 times…several more horror stories,"if you haven t already signed up to help protect the sanctity of our vote in some way do it today! leisa and i have worked in polling places where crime rate is high and most poll workers are afraid to work. in the city of detroit, we were surprised to find some very well run polling places. in pontiac, mi, we experienced something quite different. we saw people using pill bottles as a form of identification. we were physically and verbally threatened by the poll supervisors and watched workers call in reinforcements to stand within our field of vision in an attempt to intimidate us. we are in a war with the left who has no issue with bending or breaking the rules to win. we re not advocating that anyone put themselves in harms way. we are only suggesting you get involved in some way to protect the sancticy of the vote. contacting the non-partisan voter integrity organization true the vote is the best first step. election integrity and voters rights organization true the vote announced that it successfully worked with officials in ohio to remove duplicate voter registrations prior to the ohio primary. these registrations were originally submitted by left-leaning and democrat organizations, including acorn.approximately 30 percent of voters registered twice in the cleveland area and they did so with falsified birth dates, social security numbers, and other identification. these were submitted not only by acorn, but by field works, the strategy network, organizing for america, and other left-of-center organizations, says true the vote (ttv) in a statement obtained by breitbart texas.upon receipt of true the vote s research, 711 duplicate voter registrations were removed in cuyahoga county and 465 sets were processed in franklin county. ttv says it has been notified that thousands of duplicate voter registrations have also been removed in north carolina. because of ohio s consistent role as a decisive swing state in america s elections, it has a duty to ensure that its voter records are in the best shape possible, true the vote founder catherine engelbrecht said. having duplicate voters in ohio s poll books not only creates confusion at the polling place, but raises the possibility of fraudulent double voting. the buckeye state has recently seen first-hand just how far some are willing to go to see their candidate or cause win. ttv notes that the association of community organizations for reform now (acorn) had a well-established track record of giving local election officials questionable voter registration forms for years, especially in midwestern and other political battleground states.acorn bragged about submitting more than 1.3 million voter registrations in 2008 alone. after the organization was formally shutdown, 18 employees were convicted or admitted guilt to committing election crimes.a large percentage of the work that acorn engaged in has been officially questioned.a cleveland man said he was given cash and cigarettes by acorn in exchange for registering 72 times. the complaints started an investigation into the organization and witnesses were subpoenaed to testify against the organization.the new york post reported in 2009 that eleven acorn workers in florida were arrested after submitting approximately 1,400 applications of which about 900 were falsified.more than 2,000 applications were falsified in indiana and submitted just hours before the registration deadline.as it relates to the 30 percent of cleveland voters that registered twice, ttv founder engelbrecht said, while many voter records may become duplicated due to data management breakdowns, you have a different issue entirely when nearly a third of the irregularities show a pattern of intentional forgery. engelbrecht warned, americans working in the polls and casting ballots must be extra vigilant this year to help spot irregularities that can throw an entire election into question. via: breitbart news",1,25,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.420000000000002,19.6,0.0,0.0
george w. bush to make first appearance for brother jeb,"washington (reuters) - republican george w. bush on monday will seek to generate a fresh burst of enthusiasm for his brother jeb bush’s white house bid in south carolina, marking the former president’s first appearance on the campaign trail this year. george w. bush will appear with his younger brother at a rally in north charleston, s.c., the jeb bush campaign said on thursday. the 6 p.m. est event will be held at the north charleston coliseum and convention center. the 69-year-old former president is highly popular in the republican party, particularly among south carolina republicans, who supported his 2000 and 2004 races for president. george w. bush’s decision to go to war in iraq in 2003 remains a topic of debate in the race to find a successor to president barack obama, with republican front-runner donald trump noting that he had opposed the war. bush’s image has improved among americans in the years since he left office in 2009. a cnn/orc poll last june found that 52 percent of adults had a favorable impression of him, compared with about a third of americans when he left office. the bush campaign believes the ex-president can have a positive impact in south carolina, which has a sizable number of u.s. military facilities and military veterans who have supported the former commander-in-chief. it will be the most public role george w. bush has taken to date in his brother’s campaign. jeb bush, whose father was also president, played down his famous family roots for most of last year in his pursuit of the 2016 republican presidential nomination, but in need of a boost, he has been relying more heavily on his family ties. his 90-year-old mother, barbara bush, campaigned with him last week in new hampshire. george w. bush has headlined several private fundraisers for him and reporters were allowed in at one of them, in houston last october. on wednesday his voice was heard on a radio ad in south carolina. “we need a strong leader with experience, ideas and resolve. there’s no doubt in my mind that jeb bush will be a great commander-in-chief for our military,” the former president says in the ad. jeb bush has drawn large crowds during his appearances in south carolina on wednesday and thursday after experiencing something of a comeback with a fourth place finish in new hampshire. he has some ground to make up in south carolina, however, with trump enjoying a big lead there ahead of the feb. 20 primary vote. “president bush has been incredibly supportive of his brother’s campaign and governor bush is excited to have him out on the trail,” said bush spokeswoman kristy campbell.

"smaller eu states need stronger voice, not brussels, says czech election favorite","varnsdorf, czech republic (reuters) - the czech republic and smaller states like it should have a stronger voice in the european union, not brussels officials, the billionaire frontrunner in next month s parliamentary election said. andrej babis, head of the poll-leading ano party, has been a critic of the eu s migration policy and says prague should not adopt the common currency until the euro zone sorts itself out. neighboring hungary and slovakia strongly oppose eu plans for migrant resettlement quotas for each member state, calling instead for stronger border controls. babis has taken a similar tough line on the issue heading into the oct. 20-21 election. in a campaign trail interview, babis said member states needed more powers at the expense of the bloc s executive, led by european commission president jean-claude juncker. and he took shots at french president emmanuel macron, who has accused eastern member states of treating the eu like a supermarket . the heads of government and presidents must have stronger power and not mr juncker, babis told reuters on thursday in varnsdorf, a town on the german border. mr juncker s ideas are off the mark and that is also why the eu is viewed badly. (the eu) is a great project, we certainly need to stay in europe, but we have to play a more active role. the real solution to the migrant influx was to solve the conflicts driving people to flee their countries. we will not solve the migration problem without solving problems in libya or syria, he said. he said brussels could not force member states to accept its policies. i do not think there is a core europe and that we are on the sidelines, he said. we need to fight for our czech national interests. babis s ano party, in a social democrat-led government since 2014, has a double-digit poll lead, putting him on course to be the next prime minister. but he is facing possible police charges that he abused eu subsidies almost a decade ago while heading his food, chemicals and media company agrofert. other parties say babis should not be in the next government if charged. babis told reuters the investigation was a political ploy, saying there was no reason he should not be in the next government. the czech republic has enjoyed solid growth in recent years and has the lowest unemployment in the eu. wages are rising fast and the state posted its first budget surplus for 21 years in 2016. babis was finance minister from 2014 until this may. the businessman, who has placed his assets in a trust fund to meet conflict-of-interest legislation, said the state could be run more efficiently and could help the economy fulfil its potential. he said it was a paradox that eu states which failed to meet the bloc s rules limiting budget deficits, like france, were not punished. macron irked eastern states in june by saying countries could not pick and choose which eu rules they followed, referring to clashes including over the policy on migrants. he is commenting on eastern europe (but) should concentrate on france, babis said. the czech republic pledged when it joined the eu in 2004 to eventually adopt the euro. babis asked why czechs should be on the hook for greece s debts. in this moment it is not beneficial. i certainly don t want the euro, he said.

"by seizing the definition of ‘populism,’ reuters warns us of chaos to come","by seizing the definition of ‘populism,’ reuters warns us of chaos to come by daily bell staff - november 10, 2016 after trump & brexit, populist tsunami threatens european mainstream … back in may, when donald’s trump’s victory in the u.s. presidential election seemed the remotest of possibilities, a senior european official took to twitter before a g7 summit in tokyo to warn of a “horror scenario”. imagine, mused the official, if instead of barack obama, francois hollande, david cameron and matteo renzi, next year’s meeting of the club of rich nations included trump, marine le pen, boris johnson and beppe grillo. -reuters back in june, we identified what has become an overarching elite meme: “populism versus globalism.” we’ve never fully defined populism, and this reuters article gives us an opportunity to examine the word and the context in which it is being used. with trump’s triumph over his democratic rival hillary clinton, the populist tsunami that seemed outlandish a few months ago is becoming reality, and the consequences for europe’s own political landscape are potentially huge. in 2017, voters in the netherlands, france and germany – and possibly in italy and britain too – will vote in elections that could be colored by the triumphs of trump and brexit, and the toxic politics that drove those campaigns. the lessons will not be lost on continental europe’s populist parties, who hailed trump’s victory on wednesday as a body blow for the political mainstream. “politics will never be the same,” said geert wilders of the far-right dutch freedom party. “what happened in america can happen in europe and the netherlands as well.” we can see from these excerpts that “populism” is not seen by reuters as positive description. in fact, the synonym in the above excerpt is “toxic.” “populism” is contrasted to the “political mainstream” as well. this informs us that populism is irregular, even aberrant. we are living through unusual times and populism is the result. watching the “populism versus globalism” meme advance is fascinating because it is such a significant positioning of propaganda. we can see clearly that in many ways mainstream media around the world is not at all hesitant to reveal the basic organizational structure behind it. there is no way that populism – and, contrastingly, globalism – would appear ubiquitously in so many arenas without considerable unity among supposedly disparate media. in other words, the organization behind this is formidable. it’s not just this one example either that provokes our observations. the powers-that-be were not shy about illustrating the essential linkages between publications during trump’s election. the mainstream sounded as one when it came to trump. and top-down control was obviously evident, and commented on as well. the emergence of “populism versus globalism” doesn’t just provide us with evidence of editorial control. even more importantly it shows us how those who secretly run our societies find this sort of meme-making to be a priority because it anticipates trends and reinterprets them. by beginning to disseminate the meme in the summer, elite media shapers were able to position fall’s narrative – trump’s win in particular – within the larger context they’d already defined. we would suggest that the wave of “populism” sweeping over the us and europe is at heart a resurgence of a yearning for freedom that is obviously slipping away – not that there was much of it to begin with. but the internet has raised people’s consciousness about what they are losing, and why. as a result, more than ever, people are coming to understand the globalist narrative and are registering their disgust. but this is not going to be how the mainstream media interprets what is going on. we can already see that people’s determination to shake off political, monetary and military control is going to be interpreted as essentially greedy and selfish. we could see this interpretation emerge within the context of trump’s increasing appeal. over and over we were told that his support was “rural” and “white” – and that these individuals were flocking to trump because they were feeling “left out” of the current prosperity and thus resentful. of course, one can interpret this trend much differently. our perspective is that globalism is at fault here. initiated and expanded by a tiny group of banking interests, globalism seeks to consolidate worldwide power with a tiny group of massive corporations, governments and technocratic leaders. no wonder why so many people in the west feel left out. this vision provides them no room to grow or prosper. in fact they are not – but their emotion at what’s occurring is perfectly reasonable and logical. we wouldn’t characterize it as resentment so much as rightful anger and frustration. but reuters and the other mainstream media have gotten here first and are busily redefining what’s taking place. we’ve pointed out that the mainstream may be actively enhancing the meme now that they have gotten control of it. the idea is to marry this emergent propaganda with “directed history” and create a series of economic and political disasters that can be directly (if illegitimately) linked to “populism.” as populism is denigrated, globalism, in our view, will be uplifted. we’ll be subject to considerable contrasts between “toxic” populism and erudite – “mainstream” – globalism. we’ve already indicated that we believe this meme is a cultivated one. we don’t believe that the sudden emergence of populism throughout the west is simply coincidental or even evolutionary. we think this meme is being deliberately cultivated and that it is part of a larger hegelian dialectic that is intended to reinforce globalism in the long-term. you can see some additional speculation here. here at db we analyze elite memes, their significance and impact. it’s clear to us that the mainstream media is “out front” when it comes to defining “populism” and that there are forces urging it on. the conclusion of the meme will probably involve a series of catastrophes that will further cultivate and expand globalism. it’s happened before, especially after the 20 th century’s world wars. there is no real reason to think the playbook has been significantly adjusted. conclusion: this meme is not only of the utmost importance, it is clearly warning us of considerable distress to

oops! media lied…transgender surgery for military members cost taxpayers a lot more than #fakenews is telling americans,"liz harrington, a writer for the washington free beacon appeared on the tucker carlson show to discuss the real cost of sex reassignment surgery for transgenders in the military. harrington debunked the fake numbers the media s been peddling to the american public about the cost of the sex assignment surgeries, in an effort to discredit president trump s decision to ban transgenders serving in the military. it turns out the media hasn t been exactly honest about actual cost of allowing transgenders to serve in our military. the media s been saying the costs are only a few million per year, but according to harrington, the actual estimated cost is more like $1.3 billion to taxpayers over a 10 year period. additionally, the military members who have these surgeries take an estimated 238 days off to recover.as a side note, the $1.3 billion cost to taxpayers doesn t even include the very costly hormone treatments that transgenders in the military will need following the costly surgeries.the washington post has done their part to mislead the american public about the cost of transgenders serving in our military. they re not interested in taking an honest look at the costs to the american taxpayer. for the media, this issue has nothing to do with the cost to american taxpayers or with our national security. it s simple a matter of political correctness. and for the washington post, who americans used to rely on for actual news, political correctness trumps truth every time.the washington post published an article on july 26th titled that supposedly addressed the cost of transgenders in the military. instead, the article was written and titled to reinforce a false narrative that our president is a homophobe , a racist and a misogynist .trump s argument against transgender soldiers echoes one used against gays, women and blackshere is a portion of their article:seemingly out of the blue on wednesday morning, president trump took to twitter to announce that he would not allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the u.s. military. the rationale? the military cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. the question of costs presumably referring to procedures like gender reassignment surgery was addressed in a rand report that estimated a 0.04- to 0.13-percent increase in military health-care expenditures should transgender people be allowed to serve. trump has proposed a 10 percent bump in overall military spending, which could certainly absorb that increase.can anyone explain why members of congress would vote to increase spending on our military that would then be used for sex reassignment surgery for transgenders serving in our military? what in the world does sex reassignment have to do with defending our nation?",1,17,0.0,1,0,0,0.0,16.028235294117646,23.27058823529412,0.0,0.0

remember that time hypocrite trump tweeted obama should comply with record releases,"with donald trump handing out nicknames left and right, one nickname that has come to mind for him would be hypocrite trump. first of all, he doesn t apparently realize that the internet can document the things you say for years after you say them. secondly, he also doesn t seem to realize that those things that he said can and will come back to haunt him.for instance, back in 2012, trump, on top of previously requesting president obama s birth certificate, also demanded that he release his college transcripts.trump tweeted out on october 30, 2012, only days before the 2012 presidential election: why does obama believe he shouldn t comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? hiding something? why does obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? hiding something? donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) october 30, 2012and of course president obama wasn t hiding anything, and trump was just trying to stir up trouble to make people believe the president was up to no good.now, flash forward to today and trump refuses to release his tax returns. documents that every presidential candidate releases to show the nation financial transparency. of course, trump has lame excuse after lame excuse as to why he can t release them. all of which have been debunked.so, please, by all means, let s remind trump of his blaring hypocrisy. clearly, according to himself, he s hiding something.featured photo by scott olson/getty images twitter",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.706666666666667,14.8,0.0,0.0
кто любит стивена сигала?,"политика помните первые видеосалоны 1990-х, с их атмосферой полузапретного плода и незабываемым насморочным голосом переводчика? именно благодаря видеосалонам жители бывшего ссср впервые познакомились с творчеством стивена сигала. пусть он немного уступал по популярности шварценеггеру и ван дамму, но зато как дрались на экране его герои – мастер айкидо, отважный детектив, лихой корабельный кок и прочие супермены! как восхищённо бились сердца мальчишек, мысленно ставивших себя на место актёра! даже то, что в фильме “мерцающий” главный герой, среди прочего, боролся с вездесущей русской мафией, не охлаждало воображения юных фанатов. а потом девяностые закончились, и с ними закончился и сигал. то есть он и дальше снимал фильмы, и сам снимался, но кассовые сборы с каждым новым фильмом всё падали и падали. а расходы на них всё росли и росли: не успел актёр стать в первый раз дедом, как родился седьмой, последний его ребёнок. пока последний. в такой ситуации – когда популярность ушла, а семья и расходы на неё велики – российские угасшие звезды начинают пресловутый “чёс по провинции”, не брезгуя ни домом культуры железнодорожников, ни детским санаторием “солнышко”. что же до звёзд зарубежных, то они начинают усиленно окучивать постсоветское пространство. сигал, до того, как уже говорилось ранее, героически боровшийся с русской мафией на тогда ещё весьма широком экране, вдруг вспомнил о своих русских корнях. воспоминание пришлось очень кстати: в россии сигала приняли настолько тепло, что его вояжи в страну быстро стали регулярными. знакомства с известными политиками, вплоть до президента, толпы поклонников, внимание журналистов из серьёзных изданий – на западе о таком сигал и мечтать не мог, даже в лучшие годы. быстро войдя в образ почётного гостя, сигал попробовал себя и в роли политической фигуры, дав ценный совет президенту сша — дружить с россией. на днях заслуги сигала в области единоборств, кино и политики были вознаграждены: указом президента он принят в гражданство рф. формальными основаниями, которые озвучил пресс-секретарь президента д. песков, стали не только “тёплые чувства” в адрес россии, но и тот факт, что сигал является достаточно известным актёром и напрасно скептики кривят губы: и то, и другое – правда. вне сомнения, сигалу искренне симпатична российская публика (а равно и сербская, и белорусская): ведь больше он никому уже не интересен. а что до известности, так ведь и элита, и значительная часть общества — родом из 90-х, а воспоминания детства и ранней юности – это свято и навсегда. так что с нетерпением ждём присвоения российского гражданства сталлоне, ван дамму, дитеру болену, си си кетч и полному актёрскому составу сериала “просто мария”. с депардье-то получилось!",1,4,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,-2.2299999999999986,1.6,0.0,0.0

"with algeria's future uncertain, macron unlikely to dwell on past during visit","paris/algiers (reuters) - french president emmanuel macron is likely to use a visit to algeria on wednesday to look to the future and turn the page on the colonial past, but stop short of apologizing for his country s actions as some demand. the trauma of the 1954-1962 independence war, in which hundreds of thousands of algerians were killed and tortured was used on both sides, has left deep scars. former french leader francois hollande sought a more conciliatory tone describing his country s colonization of algeria as brutal and unfair and macron is unlikely to go further. with president abdelaziz bouteflika rarely seen in public since a 2013 stroke, macron will focus on the generational shift and importance of enhanced economic and security within that context. on a visit to algeria in february as a candidate, macron, 39, already shocked many at home when he said france s 132-year colonial rule was a crime against humanity. the president had strong words. it was appreciated by algerians, but today the idea is to turn the page and build a new relationship with algeria, a french presidential source said, adding that youth was his key message. during a three-day tour in africa last week macron again addressed the colonial past. while recognizing the crimes of the european colonizers, he also pointed to the positives of the era and made clear that his generation should not be blamed. facing high unemployment, low oil prices, austerity and political uncertainty, algeria s youth is likely to warm to macron s call to look to the future more than the war veterans. it s very difficult to have a relationship between one partner (macron) that is young, vibrant and wants renewal and the other partner (bouteflika) who represents such a severe contrast, said pierre vermeren, a north africa specialist at the paris sorbonne university. economic ties between the two countries have marginally progressed since 2012 and france is now behind china as the main partner. annual trade stands at about 8 billion euros compared with 6.36 billion five years ago. more than 400,000 algerians are given visas for france annually, almost twice as many as in 2012. if macron makes it easier to get a visa, that will be great for me. as for the history stuff i really don t care, said slimane khalifa, 25 who is an engineer at a state firm. post-bouteflika test political jostling around bouteflika has intensified as his health has waned, fuelling questions about the transition if he steps down before his term ends in 2019. with more than 4 million people of algerian origin in france, all with ties to the north african state, any upheaval across the mediterranean would have a serious impact on paris. macron s biggest foreign policy test could be algeria because the state of bouteflika s health is a worry and potentially what happens after could have huge ramifications on us, said a french diplomat. macron s friendship visit, downgraded from an official visit, is also an opportunity to appease some anger in algiers after he traveled first to arch-rival morocco earlier this year, a taboo for previous french leaders. many hope macron will go one step further when it comes to the past. france should not only apologize, but also pay for its crimes during occupation, lakhdar brahimi, retired diplomat and close friend of the 80-year-old bouteflika said last week. brahimi, like bouteflika, belongs to the war veterans who fought against french occupation and among that generation macron is seen as his last chance for history to remember bouteflika as the man who obtained an official apology. however, it remains a sensitive issue across france and macron s comments in february led to a drop in poll ratings and uproar across various strands of society forcing him to clarify his stance. with the generational change yet to take place, macron for now needs algeria to help resolve the crisis in neighboring libya and to prevent islamist militants from stoking problems in the sahel region, where some 4,000 french troops, roam close to the algerian border. all the algerians want is for france and the barkhane force to get out of mali and away from its border, said a senior french diplomat.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.723333333333333,14.8,0.0,0.0
israel: ancient papyrus proves jerusalem belongs to israel,"videos israel: ancient papyrus proves jerusalem belongs to israel israel is using a fragment of an old tax bill is meant to undercut muslims', and unesco claims to the important site. | october 27, 2016 be sociable, share! a view of the dome of the rock mosque in the al aqsa mosque compound in jerusalem’s old city, monday, may 2, 2016. while the unesco resolution which recognized the al-aqsa mosque in jerusalem as a “muslim holy site of worship” was barely reported around the world, and considered fairly non-controversial, israeli officials have been expressing fury over the matter for two solid weeks. and the muslims may have a huge, ancient mosque that has been a key part of islam for 1,300 years, but israel has a small strip of papyrus they found in a cave, which they’re pretty sure is a far more conclusive document, since it mentioned the word jerusalem and was written in hebrew. israeli officials have claimed that the unesco resolution, in recognizing the mosque as important to islam, was tantamount to denying israel’s absolute and eternal control over the entire city of jerusalem. israeli culture minister miri regev said the papyrus strip proved jerusalem “was and will remain the eternal capital of the jewish people.” the al-aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important jewish temple, and some israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory. this entry was posted in daily digest , foreign affairs and tagged al aqsa mosque , israel , jerusalem , muslim holy site , palestine , unesco . bookmark the permalink . tapatio contrary to the propaganda of the judeo-fascists, the palestinians did have a state – called canaan, that lasted for over 2000 years and built the city of jerusalem – until they were destroyed by ethnic cleansing and genocide by the j6ws for the purpose of stealing the land now called palestine. the survivors of that genocide are in palestine and scattered throughout the region. when the jews were finally driven out of palestine, for treachery and terrorism, the great majority of them went north into eastern europe. some scattered into other regions of the middle east and north africa, where they integrated and lived among the other tribes before and after the transition to islam. the j6ws that went into europe, over the centuries, were driven from state to state because of their conspiracies, treachery, arrogance, usury and all of the other characteristics they exhibit today in palestine and on wall and fleet streets. after the jewish “kingdom” in canaan was defeated, by the assyrians in 351 bce, the jews never were allowed to rise to power again. their >600 year reign in canaan was marked by oppression of non-jews, marauding and attacks on the most heavily traveled trade route in the world. after 66 bce, for a time, rome made the error of trying to allow the jews limited self-rule, which ended in rioting, conspiracy and terrorist attacks by the j6ws on both romans and the other tribes of palestine. from the time of the final defeat of the last jewish terrorists in 135 ce, until the early 20th century, palestine was one of the most peaceful regions of the world. it benefited from a lack of obvious oil resources – avoiding attention from western greed. the only upsets during that almost 2000 years were the defeat of the byzantines (the remnants of the roman empire), the european “crusades”, a couple of asian incursions and a few tribal squabbles. by 1900, palestine was one of the most productive agricultural regions of the middle east and a major exporter of citrus and olives. its “jaffa brand” oranges were famous throughout the world (i’ve never eaten one. but, i have a crate with most of the paper label in my office). the jew claim that all of the land they obtained in palestine was purchased is ludicrous. they went to some former land owners of the defunct ottoman empire and paid them something to sign bills of sale to land they didn’t own and had probably never seen. i read one report by a british officer in the palestine mandate. his unit was sent to investigate an attack on a small palestinian town. they found the entire population of the town slaughtered, many of the bodies mutilated and most of the women and girls raped, with some tortured. the animals, including house pets, had all been killed and many mutilated. after further investigation, the british army concluded that the massacre had been carried out by irgun terrorists and that menachem begin almost certainly led the slaughter. this is the sort of sub-human that jews “elect” as their prime minister. the zionists have the delusion that they can re-write history to suit their cult. they are sadly mistaken. lonny not contrary to you being a racist @$$hoie, you spend every day of your life whining about jews for several hours a day. tapatio no, jew-boy, i spend part of most days helping to bring about the day when the disease, of which you are part, is eradicated and humans can have peace and decency. lonny you spend part of your days hating jews and the other part blowing jihadis, tapadildo. hating jews doesn’t make you decent. it makes you a racist lowlife. kagey1 mint press, you disingenuously fail to state the true objection of israel to the unesco vote. that it fails to also include the jewish origins of the site. in fact, the resolution appears to state that jerusalem is only holy to muslims. it negates the prior jewish and christian connections. that is the objection, not the inclusion of the later muslim connection. tapatio lonny tapadildo still trying to get negative attention from jews. little crybaby never got enough attention from mommy. tapatio since the jews invaded and committed genocide in canaan/palestine about 3000 years ago – yup, they were there before muslims or christians. the christians appeared 2000 years ago and the muslims came 1400 years ago. but, since the jews’“claim” to palestine is based on their genocide of the canaanite kingdom after the jews were driven from egypt, that claim would seem to be shaky at best. and, ancient judaism became functionally extinct at tel megiddo in 135 ce – 1881 years ago. the “jews” that we see today are the descendants of eastern european barbarians who were converted to judaism by the few survivors of their terrorist war against rome. today’s jews and their ancestors never saw palestine until rothschild’s zionist disease. the few (about 17,000) jews that lived in palestine before zionism were all europeans, living on european charity – mostly in jerusalem. they were ultra-orthodox whose entire function was to “study” the torah and pornographic talmud – the never worked. humanity really needs to comprehend fully that this cult, that has been driven from more than 100 countries in the last 2000 years is not “persecuted”. judaism is a toxic cult-ure that lives on the blood of others – vampires, as they have been called by benjamin franklin, voltaire and others. great jewish leaders there goes tapadildo inventing a fake history again, as always. jews didn’t invade. jews lawfully immigrated under the ottomans and so did the arabs. jews committed no genocide there. the arab population grows at one of the fastest rates on the planet. there hasn’t been a canaan for 3500 years… but you’re whining about it as though it was last week. no mention of all the genocides against non-muslims over the last 1400 years? how about the ones this year? hating jews has turned you into a frothing lunatic, obviously. dumbtwat. ivanacardinale you are great!!! with this, you just shut up loony tunes!!! tapatio thanks, but don’t count on that shutting up lonny. they are assigned to sites and he probably won’t quit unless he quits/is fired from his job. lonny why don’t you lead by example and show everyone how to shut-up, tapadildo. nah, you thrive on several hours’ worth of negative attention from jews every day. ivanacardinale he might be one of those mossad trollies, being paid to do the job, the social media counterattack lonny you might be one of those racistcunts… wait, “might?”… sorry. are. ivanacardinale the war on unesco: al-aqsa mosque is palestinian and east jerusalem is illegally occupied http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/27/the-war-on-unesco-al-aqsa-mosque-is-palestinian-and-east-jerusalem-is-illegally-occupied/ lonny sorry, racistcunt… there is no law which says jerusalem is illegally occupied. who do you claim it belongs to, racistcunt? jews were also “palestinians” and were “palestinians” longer than any arabs were, racistcunt. ivanacardinale so, you are palestinian then!!! is in your dna!! lonny jews are the actual palestinians, racistcunt. it’s in your dna to be a racistcunt. tapatio no jew has more than a trace of semitic dna. that was almost eradicated at tel megiddo in 135 ce. the traces that exist in some jews are from the terrorists that managed to escape from megiddo (all men) and breed with the barbarians of southeastern europe. the iranian and other native middle eastern jews are not semitic, but persian, ethiopian, etc., so far as i know and i taught anthropology for 35 years. lonny tapadildo and his 1.5 terabytes of insane jew-hate. too funny. moosehorn so the sorry sad son of wxxre that you are admits that palestinians exist? lonny sorry, stupid… did you think you wanted to engage in a conversation about what constitutes a “palestinian”? moosehorn lol, you are a sorry stupid piece of crap. lonny says the phuqqstain who couldn’t engage in a topic if his worthless life depended upon it. moosehorn ivana was right by referring to you as loony toones. lonny i’m right by referring to you as a dumbschitt. tapatio you already showed us what you had for lunch today, tapadildo. moosehorn you keep proving that you are a mentally challenged axxhole. lonny the day you offer a mental challenge to anyone is the day you stop being a phuqqstain and graduate into average idiocy. moosehorn bravo, couldn’t come up with a better description. lonny of what pours into your jew-hating mouths. tapatio https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/77ca2bb6a1767c6776e94afaf505f28bad3b6bb346e4d3d500d1dd0f010ddc9a.jpg moosehorn i bet your parents are siblings, such stupidity and ignorance is but the result someone conceived by incest. lonny i bet that’s a jihadiqoqque banging against your tonsils. such blowing skills are the result of someone who’s practiced a lot. tapatio no “might” about it. he/she/it is a hasbara troll, either working out of palestine (and paid with money stolen from the american taxpayer) or is some jewish escuincle working out of his mama’s brooklyn apartment. lonny there ‘s a definite about this: you are one dumb jew-obsessed, racist @$$hoie. tapatio it’s obvious. so is the lunacy and stupidity behind this obsession. tapatio btw, discussions in other venues stay on those venues. ivanacardinale well, then america belongs to the native, original peoples, so, the rest of us should start packing their bags and go back to where we come from. same thing with europe. it was a roman empire, so, europe belongs to the italians then. can the “israelis” stop the crap of ancient documents? in which world they think they are living? during thousands of years everybody invaded, killed and squattered each other. so, if we go for history, nothing belongs to nobdy!! michael hess the supreme irony is that islamophobes are always going on about how backwards muslims are wanting to protect their culture going back to ancient times, yet hasbarians do the same thing. meanwhile, as the article states, there is simply nothing at all that is controversial in this resolution, the scandal is as made up as benghazi and ambassador stevens and hillary. the fact is, there was no state of israel prior to may 14th, 1948. so these people need to get it out of their heads because you cannot claim sovereignty to a single dunam of land before that. of course, as more people learn that palestine was an officially and legally created country twenty-four years before israel, things are getting far more interesting. worse yet still for israel, the rogue state has no legal hold over jerusalem at all in the real world not rules by little fragments of papyrus and religious imagery back when people did not bathe and thought that the stars were oil lamps that someone lit up each night. un security council resolution 476 and about eighteen others prove that israel holds no legal sovereignty in jerusalem whatsoever, this is precisely why the us embassy act of 1995 is waived every six months because by moving the embassy, that would put the us in violation of more than several security council resolutions. lonny sorry, moron. you are always lying about jews. who’s criticizing arabs for protecting their culture? you mean, when there are those among them who attack other cultures that you think is an attack on islamic culture? you think it’s a preservation of islamic culture when isis began perpetrating a genocide on the yzidis? there is something controversial, numbnutted goatface… they refuse to use the jewish terms for the places, even though those are the terms which have been the prolific ones for thousands of years. the fact is, goatfaced jew-hater… israel was around 2000 years ago, so there was a state of israel before may 14, 1948, and jews have been praying at the western wall for millennia. and they certainly had sovereign land there historically. you really are one heck of a jew-hating loser, goatface! israel has plenty of legal hold over jerusalem in the real world, goatface. see how it exercises its legal hold? who are you claiming it belongs to? you know who really never had sovereignty over a single dunum of the land over there? palestinian arabs. your misapplication of what you think are laws are not credible. and misusing the 4th geneva convention is what is not valid. ivanacardinale you puke violence through your words, and also ignorance. violence is the weapon of the people that has no reason. we know very well the history of that land. and you seem to invent it. and i laugh when i read every year about “israel independence”. from whom got the independence? from which empire? the palestinian? the roman? the ottomans? or from the un? most countries has battle for years for independence against an empire. israelis got it through what? as far as we know, you are being called the haggana? lonny actually, the only reason people puke around you is they see your face. violence is what you use to defend yourself, stupid. you come on here and attack me… i never attacked you… and then you want to pretend you’re innocent on top of it! what a dumb hypocrite! you clearly don’t know the history if you think there wasn’t a jewish kingdom there before. israel got independence from a region which hadn’t been sovereign in 2000 years. the last people who ruled it were the ottomans, and very temporarily the british. there were no nation-states in that region at the time. suddenly, there were, because that’s how the allies set it up after beating germany and the ottomans. didn’t know that, did you? before there was even a hagganah, the jews were struggling for independence there, and even when it was under ottoman rule they asked for independence. you don’t know much of anything. now, prattle back at me and pretend that i’m violent, when you’re the ignorant one who opened up their mouth at me first. tapatio easy-bake monkey, stfu. this is judaism in palestine . a cult capable of committing, supporting and defending the crimes below is a disease and should be eradicated from this earth . jews blow up and kill palestinian boy by force-feeding him gasoline lonny jew-hate is a form of psychosis. see your stupid little list, jew-hate weenie? if i posted all the arab terrorist acts, the ratio would be over 1000 to 1. tapatio you might note that truth is not “hate” jew-boy, 99% of the “arab” terrorists are from this source – jew owned . as subordinates of the rothschild-bilderberg empire, washington, israel and saudi arabia built and operate al qaeda, isis and the other terrorist groups operating in syria (and elsewhere) to destabilize countries and establish a “caliphate” that would “cooperate” with the empire. like the terrorist groups themselves, that caliphate would be just as oppressive and vicious as its parent (established by jewish/british bankers, 100 years ago) – saudi arabia. saudi arabia and the terror groups spawned they are the gutter scrapings of islam – equal in all respects to the zionist disease. global warfare: “we’re going to take out 7 countries in 5 years: iraq, syria, lebanon, libya, somalia, sudan & iran http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article1438.htm “israel can shape its strategic environment, in cooperation with turkey and jordan, by weakening, containing, and even rolling back syria. this effort can focus on removing saddam hussein from power in iraq — an important israeli strategic objective in its own right” and http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/rebuildingamericasdefenses.pdf “further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new pearl harbor (9/11 – perfection). domestic politics and industrial policy will shape the pace and content of transformation as much as the requirements of current missions.” (p 63) america’s “rasputins” responsible for planning the last 15 years of death – jewish zionists all clean break dov zakheim lonny tapadildo and his usual psychotic copy/pastes needs a lot of negative attention from jews. has for years. tapatio anyone who tells the truth about judaism is going to get a lot of negative attention from that disease. moiche feiglin is deputy speaker of the israeli kneset. below is the hebrew text from feiglin’s facebook page. this creature is typical of the jewish animals that have invaded palestine. translation of feiglin’s facebook post………….. with god’s help prime minister benjamin netanyahu mr. prime minister, we have just heard that hamas has used the ceasefire to abduct an officer. it turns out that this operation is not about to be over any too soon. the failures of this operation were inherent to it from the outset, because: a) it has no proper and clear goal; b) there is no appropriate moral framework to support our soldiers. what is required now is that we internalize the fact that oslo is finished, that this is our country – our country exclusively, including gaza. there are no two states, and there are no two peoples. there is only one state for one people. having internalized this, what is needed is a deep and thorough strategic review, in terms of the definition of the enemy, of the operational tasks, of the strategic goals, and of course, of appropriate necessary war ethics. (1) defining the enemy: the strategic enemy is extremist arab islam in all its varieties, from iran to gaza, which seeks to annihilate israel in its entirety. the immediate enemy is hamas. (not the tunnels, not the rockets, but hamas.) (2) defining the tasks conquest of the entire gaza strip, and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters. (3) defining the strategic goal: to turn gaza into jaffa, a flourishing israeli city with a minimum number of hostile civilians. (4) defining war ethics: “woe to the evildoer, and woe to his neighbor” in light of these four points, israel must do the following: a) the idf [israeli army] shall designate certain open areas on the sinai border, adjacent to the sea, in which the civilian population will be concentrated, far from the built-up areas that are used for launches and tunneling. in these areas, tent encampments will be established, until relevant emigration destinations are determined. the supply of electricity and water to the formerly populated areas will be disconnected. b) the formerly populated areas will be shelled with maximum fire power. the entire civilian and military infrastructure of hamas, its means of communication and of logistics, will be destroyed entirely, down to their foundations. c) the idf will divide the gaza strip laterally and crosswise, significantly expand the corridors, occupy commanding positions, and exterminate nests of resistance, in the event that any should remain. d) israel will start searching for emigration destinations and quotas for the refugees from gaza. those who wish to emigrate will be given a generous economic support package, and will arrive at the receiving countries with considerable economic capabilities. e) those who insist on staying, if they can be proven to have no affiliation with hamas, will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to israel, and receive a blue id card similar to that of the arabs of east jerusalem. f) when the fighting will end, israeli law will be extended to cover the entire gaza strip, the people evicted from the gush katif will be invited to return to their settlements, and the city of gaza and its suburbs will be rebuilt as true israeli touristic and commercial cities. mr. prime minister, this is the a fateful hour of decision in the history of the state of israel. all metastases of our enemy, from iran and hizballah through isis and the muslim brotherhood, are rubbing their hands gleefully and preparing themselves for the next round. i am warning that any outcome that is less than what i defined here means encouraging the continued offensive against israel. only when hizballah will understand how we have dealt with hamas in the south, it will refrain from launching its 100,000 missiles from the north. i call on you to adopt the strategy proposed here. i have no doubt that the entire israeli people will stand to your right with its overwhelming majority, like myself – if only you will adopt it. with high regards, respectfully, original hebrew text from feiglin’s facebook (just in case he removes the comment, as they frequently do) ב”ה ראש הממשלה בנימין נתניהו אדוני ראש הממשלה זה עתה נודע כי החמאס ניצל את הפסקת האש בכדי לחטוף קצין. מסתבר שהמבצע הזה לא עומד להיגמר כל כך מהר. הכשלים במבצע היו טמונים בו מתחילתו כי: א – אין לו מטרה נכונה וברורה. ב – אין מעטפת מוסרית ראויה התומכת בחיילינו. מה שנדרש כעת הוא להפנים שאוסלו נגמר, שזו ארצנו – רק ארצנו, כולל עזה! אין שתי מדינות ואין שני עמים – יש רק מדינה אחת לעם אחד. בעקבות ההפנמה הזו נדרש שינוי אסטרטגי עמוק ויסודי – הן בהגדרת האויב, הן בהגדרת המשימה, הן בהגדרת היעד האסטרטגי וכמובן – בהגדרת מוסר הלחימה הנכון והנדרש. 1 – הגדרת האוייב האויב האסטרטגי הוא האסלאם הערבי הקיצוני על כל גרורותיו מאיראן ועד עזה המבקש לחסל את ישראל כולה. האויב בעין הוא החמאס.

"trump holds ‘pittsburgh, not paris’ rally in d.c. after being told pittsburgh voted hillary (video)","it s like something out of a dystopian novel: having just abandoned america s leadership position in fighting climate change and realizing the move was deeply unpopular, trump ordered a day of celebration for himself. the event was titled pittsburgh, not paris, a reference to a line he used to justify pulling out of the paris climate deal.president donald trump s campaign announced a pittsburgh, not paris rally across from the white house on saturday to celebrate the united states withdrawal from a global climate agreement.here s the twist: trump is holding it in washington d.c. not pittsburgh. why? because he s too scared to actually go to pittsburgh and face the wrath of the people he just screwed over.hours after invoking the pittsburgh, not paris line, the mayor of pittsburgh made it abundantly clear that the city hates trump and found it disgraceful that they used their city s name as a pretext to destroy the planet.the president may carry around a little map of the election results, but he clearly doesn t look at it very closely. pittsburgh residents almost all voted against him. the industrial city is a steadfast democratic stronghold. and in fact, one of the reasons it remains so democratic is that it knows full well what happens when republicans don t hold factories and companies to environmental standards.as mayor bill peduto explained: pittsburgh is the example. we were that city that china is like today where the smoke was so, filled the air so much, that the streetlights would stay on 24 hours. that legacy, and the willingness not to return to it, has led pittsburgh and many other cities to announce that they will adhere to the environmental standards laid out by the paris agreement even if the president is too dim-witted to do so for the country-at-large. mayor peduto made his contempt for trump s actions abundantly clear on cnn:trump: i was elected to represent pittsburgh, not parispittsburgh mayor: we voted for hillary clinton with nearly 80% of the vote pic.twitter.com/x6trcebnj6 the situation room (@cnnsitroom) june 1, 2017mayor peduto s comments and the knowledge that pittsburgh hates trump may have led him to schedule his pittsburgh rally in a park next to the white house. there he can prevent people who disagree with him from coming and booing. like everything trump does, it was about image. people booing would have been a much more accurate depiction of where the country stands on trump s decision everyone from policy experts to scientists to politicians to average americans found trump s bankrupting of america s role in fighting climate change to be disgusting and dangerous. instead, like so many of these campaign-style rallies trump holds, the thing will be one long exercise in vanity for the man who once claimed to be working for the people. the symbolism of holding his anti-climate rally in the swamp of washington d.c. is a bit on the nose.featured image via alex wong/getty images",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.575000000000003,8.333333333333334,0.0,0.0
top democrat says trump firing of mueller could provoke 'constitutional crisis',"washington (reuters) - the top democrat on the u.s. senate intelligence committee, responding to escalating republican attacks on special counsel robert mueller, said on wednesday that if president donald trump fires mueller, it “has the potential to provoke a constitutional crisis.” speaking on the senate floor, senator mark warner denounced attacks on mueller’s impartiality and said the special counsel’s investigation of ties between trump’s presidential campaign and russia must be “able to go on unimpeded.” russia denies meddling in the 2016 u.s. election and trump has denied any collusion. while trump’s political allies have increased their criticism of mueller, the president said on sunday he was not considering firing him. republican lawmakers have seized on anti-trump texts by a federal bureau of investigation agent who was involved in the russia investigation as evidence of bias in mueller’s team. mueller removed the agent from his team after the texts came to light. republicans on several house of representatives committees have also announced their own probes into long-standing political grievances, including the fbi’s handling of hillary clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. clinton, a democrat, was trump’s opponent in last year’s election. “over the last several weeks, a growing chorus of irresponsible voices have called for president trump to shut down special counsel mueller’s investigation,” said warner, adding that the attacks were “seemingly coordinated.” “firing mr. mueller or any other of the top brass involved in this investigation would not only call into question this administration’s commitment to the truth, but also to our most basic concept of rule of law,” warner said. “it also has the potential to provoke a constitutional crisis.” warner called for congress to make clear to the president that firing mueller would have “immediate and significant consequences.” house democrats had circulated rumors last week that trump would fire mueller this friday, just before the christmas holiday. trump’s white house lawyer, ty cobb, said in a statement on wednesday that the administration “willingly affirms yet again, as it has every day this week, there is no consideration being given to the termination of the special counsel.” “if the media is going to continue to ask for responses to every absurd and baseless rumor, attention-seeking partisans will continue to spread them,” cobb added.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.22727272727273,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
"brits fined and prosecuted for weeds, weeping, and whippoorwills","email petty tyranny is alive and well in the home of the magna carta, thanks to a sweeping 2014 crime act. according to a new report from the manifesto club, a british civil-liberties organization, u.k. residents are being cited and fined — under the threat of criminal prosecution for failure to comply — for such offenses as not weeding their gardens, crying too loudly in their own homes, posting signs critical of local government policies, or even feeding wild birds. the anti-social behavior, crime and policing act — passed at the urging of theresa may, then home secretary and now prime minister — gave local officials the authority to issue community protection notices (cpns) to individuals 16 or older whenever officials believe that “the conduct of the individual … is having a detrimental effect, of a persistent and continuing nature, on the quality of life of those in the locality.” an official may issue a cpn on the spot, with only minimal warning to the individual being cited, for any offense he deems worthy, including things occurring within someone’s home. the cpn may demand that the cited individual either refrain from a particular activity or take specific actions, or both; and it may impose a fine of up to $124. in addition, if an individual refuses to comply with a cpn, he may be subjected to criminal prosecution and, if convicted, fined as much as $3,100. cpns, noted the manifesto club, do “not have to go through a magistrates’ court, and the standard of proof is significantly lower” than that for civil injunctions. “cpns therefore give council officials unprecedented powers to direct the behavior of particular individuals, backed up by the force of the criminal law.” the group found that between october 2014 and october 2015, councils issued 3,943 cpns and 9,546 cpn warnings. between april 1, 2015, and december 31, 2015, there were 254 prosecutions for failure to comply with a cpn; 200 of those were successful. a number of cpns concerned activities taking place inside the home. most were related to noises that could be heard in adjoining properties, including apartments. shouting, swearing, and even crying that could be overheard were forbidden, as was “noise from televisions, sound equipment (stereo systems), radios, musical instruments, domestic appliances and power tools.” four councils issued cpns prohibiting people from feeding birds in their gardens — this despite the fact that the royal society for the protection of birds actually encourages people to do just that. “such orders,” wrote the manifesto club, “undermine the privacy and sanctity of the home. if you cannot cry within your own house, or feed the birds in your garden, then the home has no significant meaning as a private space which is protected from the demands of the outer world.” moreover, “the noise restrictions specified in these orders are unrealistically low: it is rare that tvs or music cannot be overheard to some extent in adjoining properties, and a certain background noise is part and parcel of living in a flat or terraced house. it may be that some of these individuals’ behavior would qualify as a statutory nuisance, but the issued cpns set the conditions so low as to criminalize very ordinary behavior.” many, if not most, of the cpns concerned the conditions of people’s yards, or “gardens” in british parlance. while some requested the removal of waste such as sofas, others were merely for gardens that were not kept up to the standards of the official issuing the cpn. several councils issued cpns to individuals unfortunate enough to have japanese knotweed, an invasive plant species, pop up in their gardens. should those individuals fail to eradicate the weed — a lengthy and difficult process requiring deep excavation — they could end up with criminal records. “councils can also use the measures to stifle criticism of council policy,” the manifesto club found. a man in east lancashire was threatened with a cpn ordering him to take down “inflammatory” signs that criticized a new housing development sanctioned by the council. the signs were on his back gate and on a tree on the edge of his property. the council’s community protection coordinator said: “this notice would ultimately give the council the ability to enter the land and remove the signs.” cpns have been used to force people to maintain their houses in keeping with others’ tastes. one homeowner was threatened with prosecution if he did not clean his windows both inside and out. another was cited for keeping a bicycle collection on his property. furthermore, cpns can require people to take expensive remedial actions. if an individual refuses to comply, the council can have the work performed and then bill the homeowner for it. sources of overheard noise can be seized and destroyed. “there appears to be little respect for the rights of home ownership or the notion that your house or garden are [sic] places that you can manage as you see fit,” observed the manifesto club. “now it is the complainant outsider, and not the home owner or occupier, who appears to have the weight of authority and the balance of the law on their side.” councils have also used cpns to target particular individuals’ public behavior rather than going through the messy and public process of enacting general restrictions or obtaining civil injunctions. at least two councils have no laws against begging or public sleeping — one, in fact, was forced to withdraw a previous order prohibiting them because of public protest — but have used cpns to enforce de facto bans on these activities. some cpns were issued to people who clearly needed help rather than prosecution, such as a homeless, mentally ill man who insisted on sleeping in the woods on hospital grounds but was harming no one. it’s not hard to figure out why local officials love cpns: they can make up “laws” on the spot — some councils’ cpn forms don’t specify particular offenses but allow officers to write in whatever they please — and enforce them (and collect fines) without the bother of proving their case in court. “it is a principle of law that more specific powers should be preferred to more general ones,” argued the manifesto club. “in fact, we are seeing the opposite: the more general cpn power is being preferred to more specific powers. a quick-fix, all-purpose measure is being used in areas where other powers could be used, which means that the punishment of offences such as neighbor nuisance is occurring beyond the purview of formal law and procedure.” the manifesto club, along with other civil-liberties organizations, is calling on the government to greatly curtail the use of cpns. they also note that individuals can appeal cpns in court and encourage more to do so. the good news, the group’s josie appleton told cnsnews.com , is that the cpn statute hasn’t become entrenched law yet.

u.s. lawmakers ask wells about taking back bonuses linked to scam case,"washington (reuters) - five democratic u.s. senators have asked wells fargo if it plans to take back bonuses and other compensation to executives linked to the 2 million phony bank accounts that employees created to meet sales quotas. the consumer financial protection bureau and other regulators announced last week that they had reached a $185 million settlement with the bank over the scam. “...we write to ask whether the board of directors will invoke wells fargo’s clawback authority to recover any of the compensation the company has provided to its senior executives, including carrie tolstedt, the former senior executive vice president of community banking,” they wrote in a letter dated thursday and released on friday. the five - massachusetts’ elizabeth warren, ohio’s sherrod brown, rhode island’s jack reed, new jersey’s robert menendez, and oregon’s jeff merkley - said wells fargo has cause to claw back money under a policy it instituted after the 2007-09 financial crisis. “these clawback provisions are designed to prevent exactly what happened with ms. toldstedt: shareholders and consumers bearing the burden of bank misconduct while senior executives walk away with multimillion-dollar awards based on what the company later finds out are fraudulent practices,” they wrote. toldstedt led the bank division running the incentive program that pushed the employees to create fake accounts under real customers’ names, often hurting those customers’ credit scores, and received more than $20 million in annual bonuses between 2010 and 2015, they wrote. wells ceo john stumpf will testify on tuesday before the banking committee, where brown is the most senior democrat.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.790000000000003,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0

5 unanswered questions about abc’s cancellation of ’last man standing’,"abc’s decision to cancel its popular comedy series last man standing shocked fans, as it was one of the network’s comedy series in its most recent sixth season. [the series stars (or starred) tim allen as mike baxter, the marketing director for sporting goods store outdoor man and a family man who splits time between work and managing his household, which includes his wife vanessa (nancy travis) and daughters mandy (molly ephraim) eve (kaitlyn dever) and kristin (amanda fuller). the series was unique in that it was one of the few (if not the only) broadcast network shows to explore the life of a politically conservative working man and his experience coming to terms with today’s culture. so when abc canceled the show last week, fans were quick to accuse the network of making the decision for political reasons. the show is (though reportedly written by liberal writers) and star allen is himself politically conservative and a supporter of president donald trump. abc entertainment president channing dungey held a press call tuesday morning to discuss the network’s fall lineup, which, for the first time in six years, does not include its rated comedy. while some reporters asked about last man‘s cancellation, the press call raised more questioned than it answered. here are five questions that remain about the network’s decision to cancel the show. 1. was the cancellation of the show motivated by politics in any way, either by the series’ own worldview or by star tim allen’s own politics? despite getting this exact question on the conference call, dungey avoided answering it directly. “i cancelled last man standing for the same business and scheduling reasons i cancelled the real o’neals, dr. ken, the catch, american crime,” dungey said. “it was challenging because it was a steady performer but when we made the decision not to continue with comedies on friday, that’s where it landed. ” the real o’neals, dr. ken and american crime were ratings disasters (and none of them moved the cultural conversation much, with the exception of o’neals, which appeared to exist solely to piss off christians) so there’s no surprise in those cancellations. but last man standing was a ratings highlight in its sixth season, which brings up the next puzzling question … 2. if comedy “remains a priority” for the network, as it said on tuesday’s call, why would it cancel its comedy series? last man standing was abc’s comedy only behind the critically adored (and decidedly progressive) modern family. the sixth season finale of lms drew 6. 06 million viewers and a respectable 1. 1 rating in its march 31 broadcast, good enough to make it the primetime program that night in a tie with cbs’ blue bloods. in fact, the entire sixth season averaged 6. 41 million viewers, down just five percent from its previous season, a rare feat for a show at this point in its run. when considering last man‘s friday night time slot, that’s a downright miracle, considering friday night is where broadcast network shows typically go to die a more prolonged death. for comparison, in its second season, dr. ken drew an average 4. 41 million viewers, down a steep 16. 3 percent from its first season. the real o’neals fared even worse in its sophomore season, drawing an average of 3. 07 million viewers, a drop of 22 percent. those cancellations were obviously . which then begs the question … . 3. why did abc bring back the perpetually quantico when it draws of last man standing‘s viewership? if you haven’t seen the network’s government spy thriller quantico, you’re hardly alone. the show’s second season averaged just 2. 8 million viewers per episode, down a whopping 35. 7 percent in viewership from its first season and an absolutely astonishing 45 percent in the key demo. so what to do when faced with these embarrassingly awful figures? dungey confirmed tuesday that abc was bringing back quantico for a third season, albeit with a smaller initial order of episodes. we’re “optimistic and excited about it,” dungey said. she said the smaller episode order would allow the network to “see how it performs for us. ” of course, there’s no way the renewal has anything to do with the show’s open hostility toward president donald trump and his supporters, right? right? 4. why would abc move one of its flagship series, marvel’s inhumans, to friday night, traditionally a wasteland for unwanted shows? dungey said on the call that the network wants to make friday night a “destination” for and fantasy fans. to achieve that, abc set its series once upon a time at 8 p. m. friday, followed by marvel’s inhumans, a superhero and then once inhumans finishes its run, the network will run agents of s. h. i. e. l. d. in its place. here’s the question: inhumans is set to air its first two episodes in imax theaters for two weeks ahead of the show’s launch on tv. it’s ostensibly a show for the network, and undoubtedly costs a ton of money to produce. why would the network move this show to the 9 p. m. hour on friday when it is traditionally the time on television? and it isn’t just me who has asked this question: “did abc already doom marvel’s inhumans with its timeslot?” wondered cinemablend’s mick joest on tuesday. maybe the network just doesn’t believe it’s going to be very good. the move to friday does make at least a little bit of sense for once upon a time after a stellar first four seasons and a modest drop in season 5 (and after the departure of most of its core cast members) the sixth season of the fantasy drama averaged just 3. 2 million viewers and a 0. 94 in the key demo, down 28. 3 percent and 31. 6 percent, respectively. then again, the network just renewed once for a total reboot in its seventh season. why would abc move its premiere family show from its comfortable sunday night family slot to be a for inhumans? instead, sunday nights will begin with america’s funniest home videos, then move to to tell the truth, then reality show shark tank, and then new kyra sedgwick drama ten days in the valley. which seems an odd sort of lineup for a traditional family tv night. 5. is there any other show in history that has not only retained its audience but has beaten most other comedies of its type that has been cancelled as abruptly? ever? tim allen broke his silence tuesday to say he was “stunned and blindsided” by abc’s decision. he likely joins many of the fans of his show (at least 138, 000) who now feel as if the only family entertainment they could enjoy has been taken off the air, for reasons that can’t possibly boil down to ratings and scheduling. a representative for abc did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the article will be updated if we hear from them. follow daniel nussbaum on twitter: @dznussbaum",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.91,16.0,0.0,0.0
commissioner starts to press cleveland indians about logo - the new york times,"cleveland — the cleveland indians returned home to progressive field on tuesday for the first time since an agonizing game 7 defeat to the chicago cubs in the world series. they raised the 2016 american league pennant and handed out rings before the focus turned back to the current season. it is a season in which the indians may again be one of the top teams in baseball, but it is also one in which they may have to wrestle increasingly with the issue of chief wahoo, the smiling caricature that has long been an indians logo but has come to be seen as offensive and wildly outdated. among those who think it is time for the club to decisively move away from the logo is the major league baseball commissioner, rob manfred, who in continuing discussions with the team’s ownership is beginning to apply a little bit of pressure on the club to come up with a plan of action. in a statement to the new york times, pat courtney, a spokesman for major league baseball, said manfred, in his talks with the indians’ owners, had made clear his “desire to transition away from the chief wahoo logo. ’’ “we have specific steps in an identified process and are making progress,’’ courtney added. “we are confident that a positive resolution will be reached that will be good for the game and the club. ’’ although manfred had previously acknowledged a willingness to engage in talks with the indians about the logo, courtney’s statement appears to be the first time that manfred is identified as having staked out a clear position on the issue. it is an issue, however, that may not be that easy to resolve. although many people, including baseball fans around the country, would welcome the removal of chief wahoo, there is a significant segment of the indians’ fan base that still cherishes the logo, which has existed in various forms since 1947. “chief wahoo is the cleveland indians,” said karen hale, a local indians fan who was outside the stadium before tuesday’s game. “i think there comes a time when you have to take a stand for what you believe in. i don’t think it’s hurting anybody. ” philip yenyo, the executive director of the american indian movement of ohio, has been protesting at the indians’ opening day games for years and vehemently disagrees with hale and others with similar views. he would prefer the team eliminate the logo, and the indians name as well, but he would be happy for the club to start with the logo. during this year’s protest, yenyo engaged in a cordial conversation with a team employee. and yenyo said that over the years the indians had been very cooperative in arranging for security to protect the two dozen or so protesters who do show up outside the stadium. still, as yenyo spoke through a megaphone at tuesday’s demonstration, a man barreled through the protesters and yelled at him: “it’s a caricature. get over it. ” bob dibiasio, the indians’ senior vice president for public affairs, said during tuesday’s home opener that the club understood the passion on both sides of the issue and that in some ways the team was caught in the middle, trying to find an amicable solution. “we certainly understand the sensitivities of the logo, those who find it insensitive and also those fans who have a longstanding attachment to its place in the history of the team,” he said. dibiasio called the continuing talks productive between manfred and paul dolan, the indians’ chairman and chief executive. with their sights set on a return to the world series, the indians would prefer to address chief wahoo after the season to avoid any distractions that could alienate a large swath of fans while games are being played. “our primary focus right now is on the team,’’ he said. and it may be a really good team, especially with the addition of edwin encarnacion, the slugger who left toronto to sign a $60 million contract with the indians. the club has already sold 1. 3 million tickets for the 2017 season, dibiasio said, noting that it did not reach that mark until the end of july last year. in 2016, cleveland’s attendance was 28th out of 30 teams with 1. 59 million tickets sold, but in the wake of the indians’ 2016 postseason run, that number is now likely to soar. manager terry francona noted tuesday that his team seemed to thrive when the stadium was full, as it was tuesday, when the indians prevailed in extra innings against the chicago white sox. and sure enough, many of the fans in attendance wore the chief wahoo logo on their hats and shirts. the move to do away with the logo appeared to begin when mark shapiro, who is now running the blue jays, was the indians’ team president for baseball operations. shapiro was the driving force behind the block c logo, which has been seen on cleveland caps since 1902 and has recently become more prominent on various uniform and cap combinations the indians use, as well as around the stadium. during last year’s american league championship series between the blue jays and indians, shapiro said that he was personally troubled by the wahoo logo and suggested that its days were numbered. “i think there will be a day, whenever that is, that the people that are making decisions here decide that chief wahoo is no longer fitting,” he said then. when the jays playoff series moved to toronto last october, an indigenous canadian citizen filed for an injunction to prevent cleveland from using the wahoo logo while in canada. major league baseball joined the indians in opposing the injunction, which was not granted. but in its statement at the time baseball said it also welcomed dialogue about the logo. that dialogue began in the weeks after the world series and will most likely continue until a resolution is reached. at tuesday’s game, the chief wahoo logo could not be seen anywhere on the stadium building or on the field, but it was on the left sleeves of the blue jerseys worn by the indians players and on their caps. and it was on the white uniform shirts worn by the cleveland sports legends jim brown, austin carr and jim thome when they went to the mound to throw out the celebratory first pitches before the game. the logo could also be found on many items in the team souvenir shop, along with stickers depicting an even harsher representation of chief wahoo from an earlier period. for now, at least, the logo still survives and even thrives.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.756666666666668,11.466666666666669,0.0,0.0

poland to ban ukrainians with 'anti-polish views',"warsaw (reuters) - poland plans to bar ukrainians with anti-polish views , its foreign minister said on thursday, emphasizing the nationalist credentials of his ruling party that often talks of the historic wrongs inflicted on poles by their neighbors. witold waszczykowski said the policy was a reaction to disrespect shown at a polish cemetery in the western city of lviv, which was part of poland before world war two. the foreign ministry said lion sculptures at the cemetery s entrances that hold shields inscribed with the polish phrases always faithful and to you, poland had been covered up with boxes. waszczykowski said ukrainians who express anti-polish sentiments or make it difficult to maintain ageing polish symbols in ukraine would be refused visas. he did not say how the policy would be applied in practice. at the moment, we are launching procedures that will not allow people with extremely anti-polish views to come to poland ... those who demonstrate and use administrative instruments against poland will also bear the consequences, waszczykowski told state-run tvp1 television. poland is home to between 1.5 million and 2 million ukrainians who left their country seeking jobs after the 2014 maidan uprising and conflict with pro-russian rebels in eastern ukraine plunged their economy into recession. despite poland s support for an independent ukraine that can stand up to russia, tensions over the countries troubled shared history have risen since the law and justice (pis) party came to power in poland two years ago. poland last year passed a resolution that declared the world war two-era killing of tens of thousands of poles by units in the ukrainian insurgent army (upa) genocide . ukraine rejects that label, saying the killings were tragic and calling for reconciliation and forgiveness. waszczykowski said poland s sympathy for ukraine s struggles with russia must not push historical issues into the background. it cannot be that geopolitics, that the russian aggression will be an excuse and that for years we will not settle the issues that divide us, waszczykowski said.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.054285714285715,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0

[“the senate, under the leadership of sen. flake, took this up last week,” blackburn said. “what we are doing is recalling a privacy rule that the fcc issued right at the end of the obama administration, and the reason we are doing this is because it is additional and duplicative regulation. ” “the fcc already has the ability to oversee privacy with broadband providers,” she explained. “that is done primarily through section 222 of the communications act, and additional authority is granted through sections 201 and 202. now, what they did was to go outside of their bounds and expand that. they did a swipe at the jurisdiction of the federal trade commission, the ftc. they have traditionally been our nation’s primary privacy regulator, and they have done a very good job of it. ” “what the fcc did was clearly overreach. it gives you two sets of regulators that you’re trying to comply with, not one. so we are recalling the fcc’s rule, and that authority will go back to the ftc,” she said. blackburn said congress wants to ensure “privacy is being overseen, protected, and that when there is a necessity for enforcement, that it’s being exercised — if there is a necessity for penalties, that they are being placed. ” “in the physical space, that has rested with the ftc,” she noted. “so if someone were to abridge your online privacy and sell your information without your knowledge, without your consent, that would be something that the regulators would go after. let’s say if someone starts to wholesale sell your data, and you said, ‘do not share my data. do not share my information,’ that’s the kind of effect that it has. ” she said congress was aware of the need for more privacy and legislation, as opposed to regulations promulgated by agencies. “the other thing with the broadband providers, let’s say your isp which is holding data, and they were to scoop up that data and then begin to sell that history without your knowledge. they are prohibited from doing that, and the fcc currently has the authority to go after them. the ftc has the ability to protect consumers, and that is what they do. they are the primary regulator. but let’s say an isp begins to sell that data, then there would be complaints filed, and the fcc would go after that broadband provider under the regulations that are on the books,” blackburn said. marlow raised criticism that internet users will be exploited by aggressive advertisers if the 2016 fcc rule is recalled. “what the obama administration did — and i will say they did this against this, against the wishes of a lot of democrats — they reclassified your internet service as title ii, which is a common carrier classification. it is the rule that governs telephone usage,” blackburn responded. “those rules were put on the books in the thirties. so what the democrats did, and this was pushed by the white house in the last administration, they reclassified internet, which is an information service, as a telephone service, and then put those rules on top of your internet service. ” “they did that so they could tax it, so they could begin to regulate it. then one of the additional regulations — which is going to cost money for compliance and paperwork and additional bureaucrats — one of those regulations is privacy. but as we say, the authority that they need to oversee broadband is already articulated in section 222 of the communications act,” she said. “you don’t need another layer of regulation. it’s like flashing alerts: we don’t need net neutrality. we don’t need title ii. we don’t need additional regulations heaped on the internet under title ii. the internet is not broken. it has done just fine without the government controlling it. that’s the way it should stay,” she contended. blackburn said democrats “think government is the solution for all things. it should be either the bureaucracy or the courts that are solving the problems. ” “to them, another added layer of regulation, where you are having a federal agency require compliance of businesses, so now they’re having to file compliance papers with two regulators, not one — they don’t see a problem with that,” she charged. “what we’re saying is, it is unnecessary it’s an added cost to doing business. who pays those costs of doing business? it’s the consumer. it’s the end user. ” blackburn said ajit pai is “doing a great job as chairman of the fcc. ” “he was my pick to lead the fcc, and i’m thrilled that he is there,” she said. “he understands the utilization of the internet, all the components. he understands the backbone of the internet and what and how it works. he understands why we need to be careful with spectrum so that we increase broadband deployment and utilize that spectrum in the internet of everything. ajit knows that these components are critical for economic growth and jobs growth in this country. ” “we are very fortunate to have someone with skill set and understanding as we turn the corner and put the focus on broadband expansion in the country. i’m looking forward to working with him. i talk with him regularly,” she said. “we are going to go through reauthorization of the fcc, which has not been done since the early nineties. we are going to go through reauthorization of the npia. we’re going to put some emphasis on spectrum management and spectrum utilization from a government and also a private sector standpoint and do what we can to get broadband into these unserved areas across the country. we’re full steam ahead on that,” she promised. marlow suggested unsolicited robocalls are an annoyance the american public would like to see controlled more tightly. “that is something that’s called the tcpa. looking at how individuals interface with their customers is what we will do in that,” blackburn replied, referring to the telephone consumer protection act of 1991. “we’ll pull that up after we do reauthorizations and then do a revisit on some of the components of the tcpa. ” “people who want to work with their customers need the ability to do with them, but we also want to make certain that people are not harassed, if you will, by unwanted marketing calls,” she said. breitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. eastern. listen:",0,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,15.433333333333337,19.333333333333336,0.0,0.0
"ted cruz is forced to explain his bigotry to gay republican on national television, it didn’t go well (video)","a gay man cornered ted cruz on monday and the republican presidential candidate couldn t handle the simple question posed to him.during a forum on abc s good morning america hosted by robin roberts, an openly gay republican restaurant owner concerned about so-called religious liberty laws being passed by states like north carolina and mississippi asked cruz how he would protect lgbt people from discrimination if he were to become president. i ve noticed a lot of religious freedom laws and somewhat institutionalized discrimination laws happening around the country. what would you as president do to protect me and my husband? todd calogne directly asked.and cruz didn t waste time going into spin-mode.the texas senator claimed that the anti-lgbt laws protects everyone even though they blatantly allow business owners to discriminate against lgbt customers and employees by shielding their bigotry with the bible under the guise of religious freedom. religious liberty, it applies to jews, it applies to christians, it applies to muslims, it applies to atheists, cruz said even though he has repeatedly stated his intention to violate the religious liberty of muslims and atheists. also, being gay isn t a religion, it s a sexual orientation. and all of us, we want to live in a world where we don t have the government dictating our beliefs, dictating how we live, cruz continued. we have a right to live according to our faith, according to our conscience. and we shouldn t have a right to force others to give up their faith and give up their belief. and i think that keeping government out of the way of your lives protects the freedom of every one of us. cruz dodged calogne s question but robin roberts didn t let him get away with it. a lot of people would say, doesn t everyone have the freedom to be treated equally? she asked. don t we all have the freedom to be equal? of course we do, cruz flat-out lied to the faces of every american watching. cruz then declared that the first amendment protects everyone equally, it protects our faith before launching into how he intends to push for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, which finally gave calogne the answer he had been waiting for. under the constitution, marriage is a question for the states. and so if someone wants to change the marriage laws, i don t think it should be five unelected lawyers down in washington dictating that. if you want to change the marriage law, convince your fellow citizens to change the laws. in other words, cruz would not protect the rights of gay people as president. he would strip rights from them and treat them like second-class citizens.here s the video via abc: abc breaking news | latest news videos religious liberty laws like those in north carolina and mississippi allow anti-gay business owners to openly discriminate against gay people. it s legalized bigotry similar to the kind experienced by black people in the 1960s during segregation. and republicans are literally hiding behind religion to justify and protect their bigotry.featured image: flickr",1,19,0.0,0,0,0,0.08695652173913043,12.314736842105265,18.126315789473683,0.0,0.0
trump gets annihilated on twitter after he pretends he didn’t just trash police officers (tweets),"on monday, donald trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching ahmad khan rahami, who was responsible for the saturday bombing in new york city.twitterthis would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadn t been a contradiction of something trump had said just a few minutes before. fortunately, whenever trump flip-flops or lies, americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media and they didn t hesitate to remind trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for rahami s capture, he d dissed the nypd for allowing political correctness to interfere with catching terrorists. among the first to point this out was msnbc s christopher hayes, who tweeted: twitter hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment trump had made on fox and friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said: you know, our police are amazing, our local police. they know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they don t want to be accused of profiling, and they don t want to be accused of all sorts of things. yup trump had accused the nypd of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced:twittertwittertwittertwitterthis tweet was particularly funny, and i m sure there will be some backlash for trump to deal with:twitterthroughout his presidential campaign, trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than african american police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a law and order candidate. but thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.featured image via spencer platt / getty images",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,10.713333333333338,11.333333333333336,0.0,0.0

the world is actually becoming a more peaceful place,"the world is actually becoming a more peaceful place nov 17, 2016 0 0 is it too good to be true? is the world actually becoming more peaceful? with the advancement in technology and the rise of alternative media continuing to spread, we are now witness to many things we previously were not. with that, some might reject the statement that the world is becoming a more peaceful place, however, it is simply that we are now catching on camera and video some acts of violence that then spread on social and alternative media. we see that it is not that the world is becoming more hostile and violent, it is just that we are now catching these things on camera more than ever. as harvard psychologist steven pinker says , “the news is a systematically misleading way of viewing the world.” in fact, there is statistical and real-world evidence to support the statement that the world is becoming a more peaceful place. as we can see in the image below, the amount of deaths around the world due to war has trended downward for quite some time, outside of the small uptick in the past couple years. data comes the peace research institute of oslo. in his 2011 book, “ the better angels of our nature ,” harvard psychologist steven pinker states that the decline of violence is, “the most significant and least appreciated development in the history of our species.” he also stated that between 1945 and 1990 there were 30 wars that killed over 100,000 people each, which included wars in tibet, uganda, greece, china, mozambique, algeria and guatemala. pinker adds , “with the exception of last year’s small wars in ukraine, the zone of war has contracted to a crescent from central africa through the middle east into south asia.” the harvard psychologist also said that in his book, the better angels of our nature, he has proven statistically that other forms of violence has also declined, including murder, capital punishment, torture and domestic violence. in regards to violent war, it is happening in fewer places than what we might believe due to the media’s influence. recent examples of peace in somewhat recent years, wars in iran, peru, chad, angola, sri lanka and lebanon have ended, which is another positive and continuing trend. while it is on shaky grounds, there also still exists a ceasefire in ukraine. additionally, the afghanistan government in late september signed a peace deal with hezb-i-islami, which is the first peace deal signed by the afghanistan government since war with the taliban broke out in 2001. in october, thousands of palestinian and israeli women marched together for two weeks on a peace march which they called march of hope. the march ended in front of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s home in jerusalem, which was done in attempt to get peaceful dialogue started again between israel and palestine. just a few weeks ago a united nations resolution was passed in which 123 nations voted for (38 against) a ban on destructive nuclear weapons, which will be discussed starting in march of 2017. as kate hudson, the chairwomen for the campaign for nuclear disarmament said, “it’s very encouraging to see so many countries say loud and clear it’s time for the world to move on from nuclear weapons.” also, less than one week ago, the colombian government and the farc rebels signed a revised peace treaty, which is ending a war that has been occurring there for over the past 50 years. what we can do as dr. martin luther king jr once said, “those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war.” synchronized meditations is an easy way to effectively organize. one way to “effectively organize” is to participate in synchronized meditations, which is meditating with other people at the same time. before this is dismissed as fantasy and wishful thinking, it must be remembered that group intention and synchronized meditation has been studied over 600 times, in 33 countries and by over 250 independent research institutions. the result of synchronized meditations has been labeled the “ maharishi effect .” it’s most notable study was when 7,000 individuals meditated over a period of three weeks each morning and evening, which lowered global terrorism by 72%. while it might sound unbelievable to some, in the fields of social science, social psychology and quantum physics, it is a very serious and respected topic. while there are numerous things we can do to cultivate more peace in our lives and the world around us, such as using non-violent communication, smiling more often, gardening, connecting with ourselves in a deeper way, or being more grateful, synchronized meditations are an extremely beautiful and powerful way for people to organize and create ripples of peace in the fabric of our world. what can you do in your life right now that creates more peace within yourself and with the world around you?

saudi-led air strikes support yemen's saleh as he shifts against houthis,"aden (reuters) - a saudi-led coalition launched air strikes on yemen s capital, sanaa, local media said, lending support to former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh after he signaled he was abandoning his support of the iran-aligned houthis - a shift that could pave the way to end three years of war. in a speech on saturday, saleh appeared to indicate the end of his loyalists alliance with houthi fighters. he said he was ready to turn a new page in ties with the saudi-led coalition fighting the houthis, if it stopped attacks on yemeni citizens and lifted a siege. residents on sunday, however, said a coalition air strike overnight killed 12 yemeni civilians in one family in the northern province of saada, the home territory of the houthis. the attack could not be verified. saudi-owned al-arabiya television said on sunday coalition aircraft pounded houthi outposts in southern sanaa overnight, but gave no details on casualties. separately, the houthis, who together with saleh s loyalists, control most of northern yemen, said they had fired a cruise missile toward a nuclear power plant under construction in the united arab emirates (uae), a report quickly denied by the uae. saleh s announcement on saturday was welcomed by the saudi-led coalition, which has been backed by the united states and other western powers. the coalition, which includes the united arab emirates, is trying to help yemen s internationally recognized president abd-rabbu mansour hadi back to power, but it has struggled to advance against houthi-saleh forces. a split between saleh s armed allies and the houthis could tip the balance of power. army units loyal to saleh have been clashing with houthi fighters in the past five days, adding a new layer to an already complex situation in yemen. minister of state for foreign affairs anwar gargash appeared to back saleh s side in remarks on his official twitter page. the events in sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the arabian peninsula from iranian expansion, he said. residents in sanaa reported on sunday that the houthis appeared to be clawing back some territory lost to saleh over the previous four days, and houthi tanks were deployed amid heavy gun battles in the city s central political district. the area is a stronghold of saleh s loyalists under the command of his nephew tareq, an influential army general. the fighting has cut off the airport road, prompting the united nations to try to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from sanaa, according to u.n. and other aid officials. the u.n. was awaiting approval from the saudi-led coalition, they said. residents earlier said houthi fighters seized the television studios of yemen today, a news channel owned by saleh, after clashes that damaged the building. residents said 20 employees were trapped inside. the red cross said dozens of people have been killed in clashes over the past five days and called for civilian lives to be spared. in tehran, iranian foreign ministry spokesman bahram qassemi called for calm and restraint. all internal disputes should be resolved through dialogue to block the grounds for any abuse by the enemies of the yemeni nation, he said, according to a statement on the ministry s website. yemen is one of the poorest countries in the middle east, and the proxy war between the iran-aligned houthis and the saudi-backed hadi has created widespread hunger and disease, in one of the worst humanitarian crises of recent times. more than 10,000 people have died since 2015, more than two million have been displaced and nearly a million have been infected by a cholera outbreak. famine threatens much of the country. yemen descended into violence in late 2014 when the houthis, a group that follows the zaidi branch of shi ite islam, marched on sanaa and seized control of the government. backed by government troops loyal to saleh, the houthis fanned out across the country, forcing hadi to flee to riyadh. his ouster led the alliance headed by the saudis to join the fighting. the houthis said the missile fired on sunday was directed toward the al-barakah nuclear power plant in abu dhabi, but provided no evidence of any attack. there were no reports of any missiles reaching abu dhabi. the country s crisis management authority said the al-barakah was well protected and urged the public not to listen to rumors. the national emergency crisis and disasters management authority denies claims by the coup trumpets in yemen that they fired a missile toward the airspace of the united arab emirates, the department said in a statement carried by state news agency wam. it said the nuclear power project was fortified and sturdy against all possibilities. and enjoys all measures of nuclear safety and security that such grand projects require . the houthis had said abu dhabi, a member of the saudi-led coalition fighting against them since 2015, was a target for their missiles. the barakah project, which is being built by korea electric power corporation (kepco) (015760.ks), is expected to be completed and become operational in 2018, the uae energy minister has said. it is the second time this year the houthis have said they have fired missiles toward the uae. a few months ago, they said they had successfully test-fired a missile toward abu dhabi, but there were no reports of any rockets being intercepted by or falling in the uae.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.07142857142857142,4.790909090909089,4.4,0.0,0.0

"britain, eu clinch brexit 'breakthrough' with move to trade talks","brussels (reuters) - britain and the european union struck a divorce deal on friday that paves the way for arduous talks on future trade ties, easing immediate pressure on prime minister theresa may and boosting hopes of an orderly brexit. may rushed to brussels before dawn to seal a european commission agreement that sufficient progress had been made to begin talks about trade and a two-year brexit transition period that will start when britain leaves the eu on march 29, 2019. negotiators in london, brussels and dublin worked through the night before breaking an impasse over the status of the irish border, the last major obstacle to the opening of trade talks which eu leaders are due to bless at a summit on dec. 15. but though the irish prime minister called a british pledge to avoid a destabilising hard border for northern ireland a bullet-proof commitment, one senior eu official conceded that wording to appease may s belfast allies was a fudge which had simply put off until later the need to square the circle . while northern ireland would remain aligned with the rules of the eu s single market and customs union under which member state ireland operates, may s government is officially committed to leaving both the single market and customs union. actual negotiations on a trade pact that may take several years to agree may not start for some months. but eu officials said they should be ready to start rapid talks in january to give may the transition period she wants to reassure business that not much will change for a couple of years after brexit. speaking before sunrise at the eu executive s headquarters after a hurried flight on a royal air force plane, may said opening up trade talks would bring certainty for citizens and businesses about britain s future after quitting the eu. the most difficult challenge is still ahead, european council president donald tusk cautioned. we all know that breaking up is hard. but breaking up and building a new relationship is much harder. may, looking weary after just a couple of hours sleep, spoke after commission president jean-claude juncker announced the breakthrough, first in english and then in german and french. the move to agree trade talks 18 months after the united kingdom s shock vote to exit the eu allayed some fears of a disorderly brexit that could disrupt trade between the world s biggest trading bloc and its sixth-largest national economy. sterling was dented when last-minute objections from belfast forced may to abort a deal on monday while already in brussels, but it climbed to a six-month high against the euro eurgbp=d3 on friday. it later gave up earlier gains and turned lower on the day against the eu common currency as investors took profits after a sharp rally in recent days. facing 27 other members of the bloc, may largely conceded to the eu on the structure, timetable and substance of the negotiations. moving to talks about trade and a brexit transition was crucial for may s own future after her premiership was thrown into doubt when she lost the ruling conservative party its majority in an unwisely called snap election in june. i very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead, said may, a 61-year-old anglican vicar s daughter who herself voted to stay in the eu in the june 2016 referendum but has repeatedly insisted britain will make a success of brexit. a senior british banker said the deal signalled may would stay in power for now and that britain was heading toward a much closer post-brexit relationship with the eu than many had feared. irish prime minister leo varadkar agreed. ...what phase one was always about was narrowing the parameters, and we are now funnelling and directing things into a situation where i believe the united kingdom including northern ireland will remain in alignment with the eu on lots of regulations, he told irish national broadcaster rte on friday evening. heralding pitfalls ahead, however, scotland s leader nicola sturgeon swiftly cited the promise of free trade on the irish border as removing an argument used to dissuade scots from breaking their union with england to rejoin the european union. draft guidelines showed the transition period, which would start on march 30, 2019, could last around two years, as may has requested. during that time, britain will remain part of the eu s customs union and single market but no longer take part in eu institutions or have a vote. it will also still be subject to eu law. pro-brexit conservative lawmakers rallied around her after the deal. this looked like a signal that the party, which has been split over eu membership for generations, was not preparing to ditch her immediately despite the election fiasco in june that left her government dependent on the support of northern ireland s democratic unionist party (dup). british foreign secretary boris johnson, who spearheaded the 2016 brexit campaign, congratulated may, adding that britain would now take back control of its laws, money and borders. supporters of a radical brexit were tougher. brexit campaigner nigel farage struck a jarring note saying it was extraordinary a british premier had conceded so much in the middle of the night, agreeing to all the demands of juncker, tusk and eu negotiator michel barnier. the british prime minister has to fly through the middle of the night to go and meet three unelected people, who condescendingly say: now, jolly well done may, you ve met every single one of our demands, thank you very much, we can now move on to the next stage . asked for an example of the eu conceding something to london, which says it will pay 40-45 billion euros over many years to meet eu obligations, barnier said brussels dropped a demand that britain bear relocation costs for two eu agencies that are leaving london - costs in the hundreds of millions. juncker once put the brexit bill at some 60 billion euros ( 52.7 billion) but barnier said it was not possible to calculate a firm figure as much depended on future developments. jeremy corbyn, the socialist leader of britain s main opposition labour party, said on friday he wanted to see much more information about the divorce deal before he could judge whether it was a breakthrough. corbyn said labour had consistently called for maintaining the benefits of belonging to the eu s customs union and single market during a transitional period as britain leaves the bloc. the transitional period is unspecific and i think she needs to bring some clarity to that, he said on a visit to geneva. the eu had insisted it would only move on to trade talks if there was enough progress on three key issues: the money britain must pay to the eu; rights for eu citizens in britain and british citizens in the eu; and how to avoid a hard border with ireland. i believe we have now made the breakthrough we needed, juncker said. on citizens rights, london and brussels agreed to offer equal treatment on social security, healthcare, employment and education and that britain will enable its judges to ask the european court of justice to weigh in when necessary for eight years after brexit, aiming to create a common body of law. but the crucial breakthrough was on the future of the 310-mile (500-km) uk-eu land border on the island of ireland. the northern irish dup had vetoed a draft deal on monday. may stayed up most of the night into friday, grabbing just a couple of hours sleep, as she worked the phones from downing street to secure agreement from dublin, brussels and the dup. they agreed to avoid a hard border which might upset the peace established after decades of protestant-catholic violence, but said the details would be agreed as part of talks about the future relationship, according to a 15-page negotiators report. britain agreed that should london and brussels fail to agree a final brexit deal, the united kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and customs union that help protect north-south cooperation in ireland. in all circumstances, the united kingdom will continue to ensure the same unfettered access for northern ireland s businesses to the whole of the united kingdom internal market, it said. the dup gave only a conditional endorsement of the new terms: we cautioned the prime minister about proceeding with this agreement in its present form given the issues which still need to be resolved, its leader arlene foster said. nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and how we vote on the final deal will depend on its contents. it remains unclear how britain can fully meet all three key pledges it has made on the border: keeping northern irish rules in line with the eu, keeping northern ireland aligned with the uk mainland and allowing the uk to diverge from eu regulations. it s still a fudge, said one senior eu official. they put off squaring the circle till later. but how can they do it? for brussels and dublin, however, the key commitment was the first. the rest is theresa may s problem, the official said.

"tony fadell steps down amid tumult at nest, a google acquisition - the new york times","time to move on. that is the explanation tony fadell, a former star executive at apple known for his aggressive management style, offers for his departure from nest, a maker of digital versions of household staples like thermostats and smoke detectors that he helped found and sold to google. alphabet, google’s parent company, announced on friday that mr. fadell was leaving nest after leading it for six years, including the last two under the ownership of google, which bought it for $3. 2 billion in 2014. his departure comes after months of controversy regarding his leadership. mr. fadell, the company said, will become an adviser to alphabet and to its chief executive, larry page. in a recent interview in his palo alto office, mr. fadell, 47, talked about his career. at apple, he led the engineering team that created the ipod digital music player and worked on the first three versions of the iphone. in 2010 he founded nest with matt rogers, a young apple engineer. “i’m a guy who’s at the beginning of things,” mr. fadell said. “i don’t like to do maintenance mode. it’s not what gets me out of bed. ” but he is leaving after articles on the technology news sites the information and recode describing a harsh corporate culture at nest and abrasiveness on his part that led to resignations, stymied product development and disappointing revenue growth. the sharpest attack came from greg duffy, the founder and former chief executive of dropcam, the home video camera and service that nest acquired for $555 million in 2014, about six months after google bought nest. mr. duffy clashed with mr. fadell, remained at nest for eight months and briefly moved to another post at google before departing last september. writing on medium in late march, mr. duffy said he regretted selling dropcam to nest and noted his “extreme differences on management style with the current leadership at nest. ” in the interview, which mr. fadell agreed to on the condition that it not be published before alphabet announced he was leaving, he had answers for most of the criticisms of his tenure. he described the staff departures as a small fraction of nest employees and in line with the turnover in silicon valley, where switching jobs is common. mr. fadell said that nest had “strong ” revenue growth from the outset. in a statement on friday, mr. page, citing nest’s achievements, noted that its revenue growth was “in excess of 50 percent” a year since it began shipping products in 2011. mr. fadell characterized nest as healthy, with 1, 100 workers and strong teams in design, software and services around its three product families — its “learning” thermostat, smoke detector and video camera. yet the larger issue is not nest’s past performance but what impact mr. fadell’s departure will have on its future. nest is the linchpin of alphabet’s bet on the emerging smart home market — devices and software to automate homes for convenience, energy savings and security. mr. fadell will be succeeded by marwan fawaz, a former executive vice president of motorola mobility, the mobile phone maker google bought for $12. 5 billion in 2011. google unloaded motorola three years later to lenovo for the fire sale price of $2. 9 billion, though a sizable share of motorola’s value was its thousands of patents. in the troubled motorola acquisition, mr. fawaz led a financial bright spot, motorola home, a television box business. he pared its product line, cut costs and oversaw its sale in 2013 for $2. 35 billion to the arris group, a cable television equipment maker. in the alphabet portfolio, nest is a leading entry among the parent company’s “other bets,” its effort to build businesses beyond google’s lucrative franchise in online search and advertising. google’s record with acquired hardware businesses, notably the motorola deal, has not inspired confidence. when the nest thermostat was introduced in 2011, it was an innovative reimagining of a product category, much as the ipod was a reinvention of the mp3 music player and the iphone was a new take on the cellphone. it was a stylish piece of hardware, a circle of brushed stainless steel, reflective polymer and a color display. inside, the nest thermostat houses sensors for detecting motion in the room and clever software to learn and adjust room temperatures, according to whether people are present or not, to curb electric bills. priced at $249, the nest thermostat was far more expensive than traditional models. rivals scoffed but later offered their own models. honeywell, for example, now has a $249 model that resembles the nest oval. the pace of product introductions in the home necessarily will be more gradual, which critics often miss, mr. fadell said. a thermostat typically lasts 10 or 12 years. “some people expect us to be a gadget factory,” he said. “but you don’t want your thermostat to be like your smartphone, replacing it every two or three years. ” more is done with software, especially updates, sent over the internet and wirelessly connected to nest devices. relying on software, of course, opens the door to software bugs. in 2014, the united states consumer product safety commission ordered a recall of more than 400, 000 nest protect smoke and gas detectors because a defect could cause users to turn them off unintentionally. nest halted sales for a while and fixed the problem by updating the software. the software is what allows its devices to communicate with each other. the nest protect, for example, can detect a carbon monoxide leak and tell the nest thermostat to turn off the furnace. mr. fadell points to the 18, 000 software developers working with nest software, 12, 000 retail stores that sell nest devices and more than 100 utility companies, many of which offer consumer rebates to buy nest thermostats, for their energy saving potential. “we’re not a products company,” mr. fadell said. “we’re a products, services and software company. ” and, he added, building up those networks “takes a long time. ” it will be up to others to do that building now. yet mr. fadell expresses no regrets. selling to google, he insists, was the right choice to give nest the financial ballast it needs for the long term. when nest started, the technology giants were not in the smart home market. but now, samsung has smartthings software and devices, apple has homekit software, and amazon has the echo voice command device. nor does mr. fadell apologize for his management style. he described his strength as “holding people to a higher standard than they thought they could achieve and pushing them beyond what they thought they could achieve. ” mr. fadell said he had no immediate plans but he would spend more time looking at technology . in the last decade, he has quietly invested in and advised many fledgling companies. his current investments include impossible foods, which synthesizes beef without cattle airwave, an operating system for drones mousera, sensor technology to speed insights from preclinical drug trials on lab animals and phononic, heating and cooling. “i’m not a scientist,” mr. fadell said. “i’m looking for technology that is about to come out of the lab and has the potential to transform a business. i like to see these technologies raw.

nevada sheriffs: bloomberg-backed background checks aren’t going to happen - breitbart,"the universal background checks passed under nevada’s question 1 were scheduled to go into effect january 1, but the state’s sheriffs are making clear that it’s not going to happen. [in fact, sheriffs say the december 28 opinion handed down by nevada attorney general adam paul laxalt basically renders the checks moot by proving them unenforceable. breitbart news reported that laxalt pointed out how the language of question 1 actually ensnared those who framed it, rendering it “unenforceable” by presuming the fbi would do that which the fbi refuses to do while simultaneously failing to grant the nevada department of public safety the authority to act in the fbi’s stead — as a “point of contact” (poc) for sales in nevada. framers of question 1 wanted licensed gun dealers to serve as pocs throughout the state, but the fbi refused this plan of action in a letter dated december 14. the fbi said they were willing to let the nevada dps serve as poc on the universal checks, but that is not possible because the dps was not granted authority to do so by those who designed the nevada checks. the journal is reporting that sheriff’s across the state reacted to laxalt’s opinion by making clear that they have no plans to enforce the background checks once the january 1 effective date arrives. for example, the lyon county sheriff’s office voiced “support” for laxalt’s opinion, saying, “we will not enforce any provisions of this ballot initiative until the issues have been resolved. ” washoe county sheriff’s office spokesman bob harmon said, “based on the nevada attorney general’s opinion, the washoe county sheriff’s office cannot enforce this law at this time. ” and the douglas county sheriff’s office is advising residents of its county to “proceed with private party firearm sells and transfers as they did prior to the passing of ballot question #1. ” storey county sheriff gerald antinoro went even further, saying question 1 “is not enforceable even without the opinion. ” the bottom line — bloomberg co. appear to have acted prematurely in celebrating the passage of gun control in nevada. awr hawkins is the second amendment columnist for breitbart news and host of “bullets with awr hawkins,” a breitbart news podcast. he is also the political analyst for armed american radio. follow him on twitter: @awrhawkins. reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart. com",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.91,12.0,0.0,0.0
"amid election jitters, many big funds stay aggressive but cash tempts","boston/london (reuters) - stocks are listing, bonds are drifting and suddenly gold is back in vogue. global investors appear to be facing the prospect that next week’s u.s. presidential election may not play out as they have been expecting. until last friday, when the fbi said it had re-opened a probe of democrat hillary clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, the prevailing view among the investment set had her coasting to victory. and most investors have said in surveys they were more comfortable with that outcome than a victory by republican donald trump. now, though, several polls depict an ever-tightening race as the clock counts down to election day on tuesday, although the latest reuters/ipsos poll showed clinton still with a 6-point lead. investors generally see clinton as a known quantity who would not make major changes that would upend financial markets, while trump’s positions have been difficult to nail down. yet against the tumultuous political backdrop, some of the biggest american stock funds remain either too sanguine, too confused or too focused on extending the bull market to guard against an election day result that could shock the world like the brexit vote did in june. u.s. large-cap mutual funds, which oversee $4 trillion in assets, are heading into the showdown for the white house with only a thin layer of cash to absorb any potential shocks from the stock market. gerry sullivan, who runs usa mutuals’ $234 million barrier fund, said it would be hard to reposition his portfolio even if he knew the election results ahead of time. “there is so much confusion,” sullivan said. u.s. funds that invest in stocks with large market capitalizations are not showing any drastic moves toward precaution. overall, they have only 3.1 percent of their assets dedicated to cash, according to the latest data from morningstar inc. these same funds held more cash, about 3.4 percent, before barack obama defeated john mccain in 2008. multi-asset investors are more defensively positioned, especially those outside the united states, according to the latest reuters asset allocation poll. funds in europe held 8.1 percent of their portfolios in cash in late october, while u.k.-based funds had some 9.6 percent of their holdings parked on the sidelines. “investors are holding higher-than-normal levels of cash,” said mark haefele, global chief investment officer for ubs wealth management in london, who oversees around $2 trillion in assets. “that’s one way of hedging the uncertainty.” nonetheless, haefele said: “we’ve not seen significant de-risking around the election, but we have seen generally a consistent level of caution in the global client base.” with uncertainty about the outcome on the rise, a risk-off mood has enveloped markets around the world. the s&p 500 index has declined for eight days in a row, its longest losing streak since the market crash in october 2008, while a benchmark for global stocks, the msci all-world index, has dropped for seven of the last eight sessions. both sit near four-month lows. safe-haven bonds, recently under pressure from expectations the u.s. federal reserve is on track to raise interest rates this year, have seen only a modest boost in the meantime, but gold has surged to a one-month high near $1,300 an ounce. “the trades you’re seeing in the market at the moment will go further in the event of a trump victory,” said mike bell, global market strategist at jp morgan asset management in london. “you’d expect more downside to u.s. equities, the dollar and treasury yields.” more than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by northern trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. prices for certain s&p 500 index options expiring in the days after the election indicate a market swing of between 2 and 4 percent, in either direction, by then. still, portfolio managers sitting on a lot of cash, some with more than 20 percent of assets, say the stockpile is not a sign of worry about the outcome of the race. “it’s due to the diminished risk-reward profile of investment opportunities in a mature profit cycle,” said meggan walsh, a portfolio manager at the $18 billion invesco diversified dividend fund. “we do not feel the election is an investable event.” some value-oriented large-cap fund managers say the stock market is over-valued and they are on high alert for a market correction as the election coincides with a bull market nearing completion of its eighth year. “it can be tempting to forget that nasty downturns happen with some regularity, and there is never a bell rung to announce their arrival,” portfolio managers arik ahitov and dennis bryant recently warned investors in the $800 million fpa capital fund. after britain surprised the world with a vote to leave the european union, the s&p 500 index tumbled nearly 4 percent on june 24. it soon recovered, however, and had regained record territory by mid-august. even in britain, the referendum’s unexpected outcome has yet to show it has long-lasting effects for investors outside of the currency market, where the british pound has sunk to a three-decade low against the dollar. london’s ftse 100 index is up around 14-percent from its post-brexit trough. the fpa capital fund managers had nearly 28 percent of the fund’s $800 million in assets in cash during the third quarter. they see the stock market as too expensive and are ready for a high level of panic, if that happens, according to their october letter to investors. “an elevated level of forced selling, combined with a lack of liquidity, might result in challenges for many fully invested products such as index funds, many etfs, and funds that have no to very low levels of cash cushions,” the fpa capital fund portfolio managers said. “in a down market, cash helps mitigate losses and affords one the opportunity to buy when others are being forced to sell, generally the best time to buy.”",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
senate confirms retired generals as first two trump cabinet members,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. senate confirmed the first two members of president donald trump’s cabinet on friday, voting overwhelmingly to approve two retired four-star marine generals as his secretaries of defense and homeland security hours after trump was sworn in as commander-in-chief. the senate voted 98-1 to confirm james mattis to lead the pentagon, and 88-11 to confirm john kelly for homeland security, a sprawling department responsible for everything from domestic antiterrorism to border security and disaster prevention. the senate also voted 89-8 to clear the way for a vote on monday on another member of trump’s national security team, republican u.s. representative mike pompeo, his nominee to be director of the central intelligence agency. trump’s fellow republicans, who hold a 52-seat majority in the 100-member senate, have been sparring with democrats over confirmations of nominees for cabinet posts and other senior positions. republicans had hoped to confirm at least seven on friday, but democrats objected, complaining that republicans were trying to force votes too quickly on nominees who were too slow to provide financial and ethics information. republicans accused democrats of playing politics and risking public safety by delaying national security team nominations that they knew would eventually go through. the cia post is one of the most highly charged in washington, amid controversy surrounding russian attempts to influence the 2016 u.s. presidential election in trump’s favor. the last cia director, john brennan, who had criticized trump, resigned friday. trump belittled the agency as he questioned its conclusion that russia was involved in cyber hacking that interfered with the vote, in which trump, a new york businessman and reality television star, defeated democrat hillary clinton, a former secretary of state. “we face threats foreign and domestic. it’s critical for the president to have a full national security team today, day one,” said republican senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee. democrat kirsten gillibrand was the only senator to vote against mattis, a 66-year-old commander revered by marines. she was also the only member of the armed services committee to vote against him when the panel approved him by 26-1 earlier this week. gillibrand has said she admires mattis. but she objected to waiving a law on civilian control of the u.s. military to allow him to lead the pentagon only 3-1/2 years after retiring from the marines, instead of the seven required by the statute. the law had only been waived once before, in 1950, to allow george marshall, the post-war secretary of state, to serve as secretary of defense. congress passed mattis’ waiver last week, and trump signed it just after he was inaugurated on friday. eleven democrats voted “no” on kelly, also 66. while the 40-year military veteran is also very popular, some democrats said he had not done enough to assure them that he would oppose some of trump’s most controversial proposals. for example, they said he had not rejected rounding up and deporting thousands of people who entered the united states illegally as children, but have been productive members of society. that group, known as “dreamers,” were protected from deportation by an executive order signed by former president barack obama. trump has promised to rescind many such orders. trump said he was pleased that mattis and kelly were confirmed. “i call on members of the senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees, so that we can get to work on behalf of the american people without further delay,” he said in a statement.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.55,8.0,0.0,0.0
"iraq plans to take control of kurdistan region's border 'in coordination' with iran, turkey","erbil, iraq (reuters) - iraq plans to take control of the borders of its autonomous kurdistan region in coordination with iran and turkey, the iraqi defence ministry said on friday. the statement did not give more detail or indicate specifically whether iraqi forces were planning to move toward the external border posts controlled by the kurdistan regional government (krg) from the iranian and turkish side. the move to seize the border posts is a response to a kurdish referendum on monday that produced a vote in favor of secession from iraq. following the vote, iraq, iran and turkey demanded that the krg relinquish control over its external border crossings with turkey, iran and syria. backed by ankara and tehran, the iraqi government has demanded that the kurdish leadership cancel the result of the referendum or face the prospect of sanctions, international isolation and possibly a military intervention. earlier on friday, a ban imposed by iraq s central government on international flights to kurdistan went into effect after the krg rejected a demand to hand over control of its international airports in erbil and sulaimaniya. the krg also refused to relinquish control of its border crossings, erbil-based tv rudaw said on friday, citing a kurdish official. the iraqi defence ministry said the implementation of central government decisions to take over management of all the border posts and airports was going as planned in coordination with the relevant authorities and neighboring countries, and there is no delay in the procedures . iraqi state television said an iraqi military delegation had visited the kurdistan border from the iranian side. an iraqi force is also deployed on the turkish side of the border as part of joint drills with the turkish army.",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.784285714285716,11.314285714285715,0.0,0.0
anti-semitism growing in europe,"while i understand this sentiment is coming from a place of concern, european jews should not leave out of fear and should push their leaders to defeat anti-semitism and radical islamist terrorism. that said, none of this is surprising. after all, we've recently witnessed murderous terrorist attacks on the jewish communities of copenhagen, denmark, and paris, attacks that have shaken an already fearful community to its core. each attack adds to the feelings of insecurity among european jews and adds more levels of necessary security. as a result of the intensified wave of anti-semitism and islamist terrorism, jews in europe are eschewing jewish identifying symbols and are afraid to attend prayers and to send their children to their jewish schools. this has led to an unprecedented desire to leave their home countries and flee to greater freedom and security. but seeing schools doubling as high-security facilities sends a message to our children -- who are the next generation of european jewry -- that their lives are in constant danger. of course, it is understandable and natural that the authorities choose to take heightened security measures to prevent further loss of life. but the fight must be taken to the perpetrators rather than allowing it to infringe further upon the everyday lives of the victims. if, in the words of european leaders, they would like the jews of europe to stay and not to emigrate, then they must find a way to return a semblance of normalcy to the everyday lives of jews across the continent. to defeat this bloody and belligerent strain of terrorism and the specter of radical islamism and jew-hatred, european authorities must be more proactive in hunting down terrorists before they act and not grant them a victory by further imposing restrictions on europe's jews. the threat is not country specific, so the response must be found in europe as a union. european nations need to immediately and urgently come together to form a pan-european authority to deal with anti-semitism and this new form of homegrown radical islamist terrorism, with significant resources tasked with finding concrete practical solutions. the first step that has to be taken is to bolster and improve intelligence-gathering and sharing across europe. the current system is neither efficient nor vigilant enough. many of the perpetrators of the recent massacres of jews were well-known to the police. many crossed borders, seemingly with little trouble, before and after they committed their bloody acts. police and law enforcement also need to be strengthened. this includes actively enforcing laws against incitement and anti-semitic speech and taking a firmer approach against those who promote hate and violence. enforcement authorities must enter and act within largely muslim areas where police might ordinarily be reluctant to enter additionally, new legislation to combat radical islamist terrorism and anti-semitism must be passed. the reality is that europe is dealing with a new threat using an infrastructure that was not built to deal with homegrown terrorists who run freely in europe and kill people seemingly at will. in short, european authorities have to change the current mode of action and move from a paradigm of almost pure defense onto the attack. our continent has known in the past how to deal with threats to our way of life, and as in the past, the best chance of victory is to be found in a continentwide unity of purpose. any weakness in a european-wide response to this new threat -- not just to jews, but also to the very essence that our union was built upon, like freedom of thought and speech -- will be exploited by the terrorists and their supporters. there are probably dozens of attacks at various stages of planning taking place in towns and cities across europe. it is not enough just to increase security at any possible target, because this policy alone is not working and cannot be a long term answer. it is time europe went on the offensive.",0,4,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.57,11.600000000000001,0.0,0.0

germany's merkel working toward spring meeting with trump: sources,"berlin (reuters) - chancellor angela merkel is working to set a date this spring for a meeting with donald trump, who will be sworn in as u.s. president on friday, german government sources said on monday. merkel had offered to meet trump in the united states in her capacity as chairman of the group of 20 leading economies, the sources said. the chancellor has spoken with trump only once, shortly after his election to succeed u.s. president barack obama. in a joint interview published by the times of london and germany’s bild newspaper on monday, trump said he had always had “great respect” for merkel, but described her 2015 decision to allow in a wave of a million migrants as a “catastrophic mistake” that opened the door to terrorist attacks. merkel refused to comment on the interview during a news conference with new zealand prime minister bill english, saying she would wait until after trump’s inauguration and then planned to work with him at all levels of government.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.89777777777778,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
"putin, ahead of election, says opposition would destabilize russia","moscow (reuters) - president vladimir putin warned on thursday that some of his opponents would destabilize russia and usher in chaos if they were elected in a presidential election next year, but promised genuine political competition. putin, who is running for re-election in march, was answering a question at his annual news conference about opposition leader alexei navalny who looks unlikely to be allowed to contest the election due to what navalny says is a trumped up criminal case. the question was put to him to ksenia sobchak, a television personality who has said she plans to run against putin in the same election, which polls suggest putin will comfortably win. putin, in response, accused sobchak, who has said she wants to attract voters who are against all candidates, of not offering any positive solutions to the problems facing russia. he likened navalny to former georgian president mikheil saakashvili who came to power in his own country in 2004 after a peaceful revolution and is now heavily involved in politics in ukraine, where he is calling for the impeachment of ukrainian president petro poroshenko. do you want tens of people like saakashvili to be running around public squares? putin asked sobchak, when asked about navalny not being allowed to take part in the election. those who you ve named (navalny) are the same as saakashvili, only the russian version. and you want these saakashvilis to destabilize the situation in the country? do you want attempted coups d etat? we ve lived through all that. do you really want to go back to all that? i am sure that the overwhelming majority of russian citizens do not want this. putin said the authorities were not afraid of genuine political competition and promised such competition would exist. navalny, commenting on social media, said putin s response showed the reasons for barring him from taking part in next year s presidential election were due to a political decision. it s like he s saying we re in power and we ve decided that it (navalny running) is a bad idea, navalny said.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.142222222222227,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0
suicide hotlines get record number of calls after trump win: “phones have been ringing off the hook”,"comments (4) read by 130 people things have gotten steadily worse for democrats after donald trump’s election to the presidency of the united states. scores of celebrities are freaking out across social media, hillary supporters are holding “cry ins” to help each other cope, visits to canada’s immigration website have skyrocketed , and coping videos are starting to make the rounds online. while many shocked clinton supporters have found solidarity with thousands of others by protesting and rioting in the streets, some, like movie star robert deniro, have fallen into a depressive state . and according to the hill , those overwhelming feelings of depression have led to suicidal thoughts in many. so much so that suicide hotlines across the country are struggling to keep up: phones have been ringing off the hook at suicide hotlines since donald trump was named president-elect tuesday. according to multiple reports, many of those calling or texting into hotlines are members of the lgbtq community, minorities and victims of sexual assault who are worried about trump’s victory. the suicide prevention lifeline told “ the washington post” it is seeing calls “unmatched in the hotline’s history,” with a response unlike that in 2008 or 2012. … election stress is nothing new. psychologists have noted upticks in anxiety and stress during and following contentious election cycles. this specific election, many have observed, is no exception and is exceeding average numbers in those seeking mental care and counseling. if you are someone you know can’t handle the stress, please share this video. mac slavo views: read by 130 12th, 2016 website: www.shtfplan.com copyright shtfplan and mac slavo. this content may be freely reproduced in full or in part in digital form with full attribution to the author and a link to www.shtfplan.com. please contact us for permission to reproduce this content in other media formats.",1,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.698823529411765,9.15294117647059,0.0,0.0
fbi gave emails to wikileaks to prevent ‘clinton coup’,"posted by eddie the emails released by wikileaks were leaked by brave members of the us intelligence community in an effort to expose hillary clinton’s corruption and stop her being elected, according to state department insider steve pieczenik . the clintons have initiated a “ silent coup ” in their bid for power, pieczenik claims, explaining that the white house, judiciary, cia, fbi, loretta lynch and james comey have all been “ co-opted ” through political cronyism. but piecezenik, a state department veteran who has served in seven administrations, claims there is mutiny within the intelligence community and a “ counter-coup ” is in operation. “ in order to stop this coup we in the intelligence community have informally got together and with their permission i am starting to announce that we have initiated a counter-coup through julian assange and wikileaks. “ pieczenik was deputy assistant secretary of state under henry kissinger, cyrus vance and james baker, and served the administrations of gerald ford, jimmy carter, ronald reagan and george h.w. bush as deputy assistant secretary. he is a legitimate insider with connections in all departments and agencies. fbi mutiny his claims might explain the unprecedented and mysterious actions by the fbi on tuesday. the fbi vault silently and unexpectedly made documents relating to the investigation into hillary clinton available to the public – documents that were not due to be declassified until 2041. we can finally stop blaming russians. pieczenik states clearly that us intelligence – brave men and women in the fbi, cia and wider intelligence community – submitted the emails to julian assange and wikileaks in order to thwart “ the second american revolution .” this counter-coup is working against hillary clinton and her campaign. their goal is a peaceful transition of power away from the corrupt clintons. “ something had to be done to save the republic ,” he explains. source:",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.58666666666667,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
obama: hillary clinton pardon could heal divided nation,"note to president obama: a hillary clinton pardon could heal a divided nation. after all, if it was good enough for richard nixon, it is certainly good enough for clinton. the difference being that tricky dicky was actually guilty of the crimes insinuated against him, whereas the former secretary of state, who was thoroughly investigated and cleared of any criminal wrongdoing twice, continues to be maligned and persecuted by the right-wing establishment, as well as politicos with decades-old grudges who view the clinton witch hunt as their opportunity to exact revenge on the woman who should be america’s first female president of the united states , and proved it by carrying the nation’s popular vote if not the antiquated electoral college. as originally proposed by one-time presidential hopeful, rev. jesse jackson, the nation should call upon president barack obama to issue a blanket pardon to the twice-exonerated clinton, in order to call an end to the drawn-out attack on every aspect of the former new york senator’s character once and for all. in the 21st century, it is unthinkable to believe that u.s. citizens are so narrow-minded and circumspect that they seek to stop an empowered, idolized public servant from holding the highest office in the nation simply because she is a woman. while it is abominable and heartbreaking to lend credence to this theory, there is strong evidence to support its existence, especially when considering some examples from other nations who have female world leaders: — indian prime minister indira gandhi (1966-77; 1980 to oct. 31, 1984 (her assassination)) — british prime minister margaret thatcher (1979-90). thatcher was the longest-serving british prime minister of the 20th century and first woman to have held the office. — israeli prime minister golda meir (1969-74) — german chancellor angela merkel (2005-present) — queen elizabeth ii of united kingdom (u.k.), great britain, and northern ireland (1952-present) — south korean president park geun-hye (2013-present) — prime minister theresa may of u.k., great britain, and northern ireland (2016-present) — prime minister sheikh hasina wajed of bangladesh (1996-2001; 2009-present) from countries great and small, these women and countless others have achieved the ultimate seat of power in their respective nations. some of these countries have a long, storied legacy of woman leaders that spans decades and even generations, while others are relatively new to welcoming a female presence as their central figurehead. nonetheless, women all over the globe have been given the opportunity to lead their countries into a new era and provide their citizens with a different perspective, with the glaring exception of the united states, a nation that could benefit immensely from female influence at the helm. presidential pardons are not a foreign concept. every u.s. president has the authority to grant pardons, which is also known as clemency, to anyone of their choosing. however, unlike most executive powers, presidential pardons are unchecked by congress and cannot be blocked, overturned, or reviewed. the purpose of this power exists to help ease tensions, correct historic injustices, and heal political wounds. if any situation calls for its implementation, this scenario could not be more fitting. yet, this authority does not come without controversy. in addition to president gerald ford’s pardoning of richard nixon in 1974, other controversial acts of clemency include president bill clinton’s pardon of symbionese liberation army sympathizer and publishing heiress patty hearst in 2001, president richard nixon’s offer of clemency to teamster boss jimmy hoffa in 1971, and president jimmy carter’s commutation of watergate conspirator g. gordon liddy’s prison sentence in 1977. as evidenced by the vitriol of the 2016 campaign and subsequent general election , a hillary clinton pardon by president obama could be the only way to end the vicious cycle of recrimination and violence observed throughout the so-called democratic process , which has encountered its own foibles and criticisms. namely, the ongoing debate about the necessity of the electoral college and its all-or-nothing allotment, which many consider unjust and obsolete. instead, many believe the winner of the popular vote should be elected as u.s. commander in chief, which would have resulted in president-elect clinton occupying the oval office. in the aftermath of the controversial election results, a blanket pardon for the veteran politician could be the first step in healing a divided nation, which has truly demonstrated its fractured populace via the chaotic antics and disdainful actions observed throughout the extended 2016 campaign cycle, as well as in the aftermath of its divisive conclusion. opinion written and edited by leigh haugh sources: personal opinions and observations of the author detroit free press –obama should pardon hillary clinton, jesse jackson says new york times –hillary clinton, in emotional speech, implores supporters to keep believing in america mtv –we need female politicians now more than ever washington post –here are the dozens of democracies that have elected a female leader all article images courtesy of wikimedia commons – creative commons license clinton , donald trump , hillary clinton , jesse jackson , president barack obama , presidential pardons",1,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.605000000000004,18.2,0.0,0.0
"megyn kelly’s jump to nbc from fox news will test her, and the networks - the new york times","for megyn kelly, the shift from fox news to nbc — where she will host a daily daytime show and a sunday newsmagazine program — will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom. but her move, announced tuesday, has broader implications for the television news industry, raising new questions about the future of fox news, where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with ideology, and of nbc news, which has been a longtime bête noire for conservative press critics. and it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives jan. 20 with the inauguration of donald j. trump. the murdoch family, which controls fox news’s parent company, 21st century fox, had become so invested in ms. kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $20 million a year. people inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the murdochs were staking the network’s future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a fox news anchor — for instance, by publicly taking on the republican nominee for president. but now fox news, long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate, is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no anchor with ms. kelly’s history of challenging mr. trump. her show, “the kelly file,” was sandwiched between the program of bill o’reilly — she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings — and that of mr. trump’s major booster, sean hannity. her departure, coming after that of greta van susteren, also means that fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time. that is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer‘s sexual harassment scandal involving its and former chairman, roger ailes, in which many women described experiencing harassment or intimidation. (fox is said to be looking at several potential female successors for ms. kelly.) for nbc, the addition of ms. kelly, 46, may help address a challenge confronting many major news organizations: connecting with a politically diverse audience. in bringing ms. kelly to nbc, andrew lack, the chairman of the news division, is adding a journalist schooled in the preferences and worldviews of the conservative americans who helped elect mr. trump, and whose anger so many news organizations failed to appreciate. ms. kelly’s closely watched career move capped months of drama in the political sphere, in which she was often at the center of mr. trump’s intense, campaign, and in the media world, where she became a key figure in the events that led to mr. ailes’s ouster. ms. kelly was the most prominent among a group of women at the network who told internal investigators that mr. ailes had engaged in inappropriate behavior. (mr. ailes has denied all the accusations.) despite having made a generous offer to ms. kelly, rupert murdoch, an executive chairman of 21st century fox, whose negotiation tactics are legendary, offered a supportive statement about her decision to leave. “we thank megyn kelly for her 12 years of contributions to fox news,” the statement read. “we hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family the best. ” though the loss of ms. kelly is a blow to fox news, the network has a winning formula that has kept it atop the ratings for many years, and helped it to avoid the its rivals experienced in the weeks after election day, as the associated press reported. and now the nation has a new republican president whose approach speaks to the sensibilities of many of fox’s viewers. company executives said the murdochs knew ms. kelly was a flight risk their offer included keeping her in prime time, and she had made it clear she was seeking a job that would give her more time for her family. ms. kelly had spoken with top executives at abc news, cnn and in the syndication industry, as well as nbc news, but nbc remained largely under the radar as a landing spot. one person briefed on ms. kelly’s deliberations said that mr. lack won her over by starting the talks with a question about what she was seeking, instead of flatly offering possibilities. he then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences. a daytime show would give her a schedule that would allow her to see her children off to school and to have dinner with them and her husband, douglas brunt, a novelist. people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to disclose what ms. kelly’s new annual salary would be at nbc. fox news rivals who sought to hire ms. kelly away, including nbc news, had indicated that they could not match the $20 million offer from fox, the cable news leader for the last 15 years running. but even a modest raise for ms. kelly would place her among television’s journalists. the wall street journal recently reported she was to collect $15 million for the final year of her contract. her high price tag was worth it for mr. lack, who took over leadership of nbc news and msnbc in 2015, 14 years after he had ended an tenure running the divisions. executives at nbc universal turned to him to stabilize the network after the suspension of the nightly news anchor brian williams for embellishing accounts of his reporting in iraq, and as msnbc floundered in the ratings. among his moves since returning has been to direct msnbc back toward more traditional, hard news coverage during its daytime hours — like its cable news rivals, it hit record ratings highs last year — and away from its yearslong market position as a answer to fox news, which at times colored the reputation of its sister, nbc news. ms. kelly will not be reporting for msnbc, which still has hosts like rachel maddow and lawrence o’donnell. in a brief interview, mr. lack said he would be closely involved in the creation of ms. kelly’s daytime show, which will run monday through friday at a time to be determined, as well as the one she will anchor on sunday nights. that show will be in the vein of cbs’s “60 minutes,” where mr. lack worked early in his career. “the thing about this that is challenging but exciting as hell is that we love making new shows,” he said. “you don’t get that opportunity that often any more, and you don’t get the opportunity to do that with a talent like megyn. ” yet the move has its risks for all involved, especially the daytime program. daytime television has been notoriously difficult for news stars. people involved in the discussions said that the program was not planned to be in the mold of a traditional daytime talk show, nor much like the special ms. kelly hosted last may on the fox broadcast network, which drew some harsh criticism (some of which ms. kelly dismissed as liberal disappointment over a friendly interview with mr. trump). in an interview with charlie rose on “cbs sunday morning” last year, ms. kelly described the television show of her fantasies. “how about if we merge a little charlie rose, a little oprah, and a little me all together,’’ she said. “and we serve that up as an hour? wouldn’t you watch that?” ms. kelly kept a relatively low profile on tuesday, addressing her own news at the end of that night’s edition of “the kelly file. ” “this was a tough decision for me,” ms. kelly said, thanking the murdochs and attributing the move in part to her desire for more time with her children. her last show on fox is on friday.",0,19,0.0,0,0,0,0.047619047619047616,6.507777777777779,9.422222222222222,0.0,0.0

obama announces lifting of u.s. sanctions on myanmar,"washington (reuters) - president barack obama formally announced the lifting of u.s. sanctions on myanmar on friday by terminating an emergency order that deemed the policies of the former military government a threat to u.s. national security. “i have determined that the situation that gave rise to the national emergency ... has been significantly altered by burma’s (myanmar’s) substantial advances to promote democracy, including historic elections in november 2015,” obama said in a letter to the u.s. house and senate speakers. a u.s. treasury statement said that as a result of the termination of the emergency order the economic and financial sanctions administered by the department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control were no longer in effect. the move followed a meeting between myanmar’s de facto leader aung san suu kyi and obama in washington last month, when she called for the lifting of economic sanctions against her country, and he said he was willing to do this. suu kyi’s national league for democracy won a sweeping victory in the november elections. obama’s letter pointed to the formation of a democratically elected, civilian-led government as a result of the election, the release of many political prisoners and improved human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and freedom of association and peaceful assembly. “while burma faces significant challenges, including the consolidation of its democracy, the united states can, and intends to, use other means to support the government and people of burma in their efforts to address these challenges,” obama’s letter said. suu kyi, a nobel peace prize laureate and democracy icon, helped persuade the west to impose sanctions on myanmar, which is also known as burma, during her years as a jailed opposition leader. she is now trying to strike a balance between showing her people the economic rewards of a democratic transition while keeping pressure on the country’s generals for further reforms. some members of the u.s. congress have expressed concerns about the extent and durability of change in myanmar and introduced legislation seeking to give lawmakers some influence on the process of easing sanctions. rights groups condemned last month’s announcement, saying it forfeited leverage on myanmar’s military. officials of the u.s. administration have said the removal of sanctions would not apply to military-to-military assistance, given the extent of the military’s involvement in politics and rights abuses. suu kyi herself has been criticized for doing too little to address the plight of myanmar’s stateless rohingya muslim minority. the state department said last month that several restrictions would remain in place, including barring visas for military leaders.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.094999999999999,11.600000000000001,0.0,0.0
forbes list of “the world’s most powerful people of 2016” is out…and obama’s ranking is embarrassing,"hey michelle guess what? for the first time in 8 years, the entire country can be proud of their president again forbes recently released its rankings of the world s most powerful people, and the results don t look good for president barack obama.there are nearly 7.4 billion humans on planet earth, but these 74 men and women make the world turn. forbes annual ranking of the world s most powerful people identifies one person out of every 100 million whose actions mean the most.to compile the list, we considered hundreds of candidates from various walks of life all around the globe, and measured their power along four dimensions. first, we asked whether the candidate has power over lots of people.next we assessed the financial resources controlled by each person. are they relatively large compared to their peers? for heads of state we used gdp, while for ceos, we looked at measures like their company s assets and revenues.then we determined if the candidate is powerful in multiple spheres. there are only 74 slots on our list one for approximately every 100 million people on the planet so being powerful in just one area is often not enough.lastly, we made sure that the candidates actively used their power. forbesin 2015, obama came in as the third most powerful person, which wasn t great, considering he is supposed to be the leader of the free world. but it was nevertheless much better than 2016 s list, which has him placed at an embarrassing number 48.last year, forbes explained why the u.s. president wasn t number one, or even number two. there s no doubt that the united states remains the world s greatest economic, cultural, diplomatic, technological and military power, the publication wrote in 2015. but as obama enters the final year of his presidency, it s clear his influence is shrinking, and it s a bigger struggle than ever to get things done. his influence and ability to get things done must have hit rock bottom for him to fall a whopping 45 spots in just one year.what s even more embarrassing than the fact that obama didn t make the top 10, much less the top 25, or even the top 40, were some of the people who outranked him.for example, north korean dictator kim jong un was five spots ahead of obama.if a ridiculous, barbaric leader who imprisons, enslaves and executes political and religious dissenters and restricts the most basic of freedoms is ahead of the u.s. president, you know there is a real problem.russian president vladimir putin claimed the number one spot, again, while a new face appeared at number two president-elect donald trump. donald trump is trading in trump tower for the white house. the new york native will become the first billionaire president of the united states, after upsetting hillary clinton in a surprising election victory, when he takes over the oval office in 2017, forbes said about the incoming president.meanwhile, the publication issued a brutal but honest assessment of the outgoing president whose policies and legacy were rejected in november when voters chose trump over what would have been essentially a third-term obama in democrat hillary clinton. america s outgoing president faces a legacy in jeopardy as his successor has threatened to unravel signature achievements, including health care reform and the iranian nuclear accord, forbes wrote about obama. president obama is leaving the oval office on anything but a good note, and his legacy will reflect his dismal performance as the nation s leader. conservative tribune h/t truthfeed",1,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.350000000000005,8.9,0.0,0.0
nz prime minister heads to trade talks with foreign investment ban on her mind,"wellington (reuters) - new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern said on thursday she will seek to renegotiate the trans-pacific partnership (tpp) agreement in vietnam in two weeks time to allow the government to ban foreign speculators buying new zealand existing homes. ardern, who was sworn in on thursday after negotiating a labour-led coalition after a tight election result, said she had already started work on the restrictions. whether it s tpp or any other agreement it s making sure we have the ability to ban foreign buyers from buying existing homes in new zealand, ardern told reporters in wellington. the 11 tpp members had set a goal of reaching broad agreement on the pact in november at an asia-pacific economic cooperation meeting set to be held in vietnam s danang. new zealand previously touted itself as a champion of free trade and was a key backer of the tpp since the united states withdrew in january, but labour has expressed concern tpp would stop it from banning foreigners from buying existing homes. foreign investors can still buy new houses and apartments. the policy is designed to combat a politically sensitive housing crunch that has priced many new zealanders out of the market, with prices up more than 50 percent nationally in the last decade. in the city of auckland, prices have almost doubled in that period. new zealand was the sixth most popular market for chinese investors, down from fifth last year, said jane lu, head of australia and new zealand for international property website juwai.com. she said foreign buyers tended to fast-forward plans to purchase overseas when new restrictions or taxes loomed. while voters have taken to their charismatic 37-year-old leader, traders have been less impressed with the government s planned protectionist policies and coalition government. the currency had fallen to $0.6861 on wednesday, its lowest level since may, having plummeted more than 6 percent since the sept. 23 election. the kiwi last stood at $0.6878. veteran protectionist politician winston peters, the leader of new zealand first which holds the balance of power, delivered a victory to labour after the 23 sept. election failed to result in a majority for labour or national. peters last year described a chinese company taking a majority ownership in a small new zealand dairy processor as lunacy , while he called dairy giant fonterra s decision to send cows to china economic treason . his policies have consistently centered around tight controls on immigration and foreign investment. as well as renegotiating the tpp, ardern said on thursday that immigration numbers would be cut by up to 30,000 from record levels of over 70,000. any trade and foreign ownership restrictions could hurt new zealand s reputation as an open economy and antagonize the likes of china. trade between the two countries has grown to more than nz$20 billion ($14.4 billion) a year, and chinese president xi jinping called the relationship unprecedented in its depth.",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.07142857142857142,5.884285714285717,11.314285714285715,0.0,0.0
jeb bush has 'grave doubts' about donald trump in wh,"bush also said he has little confidence in trump's ability to appropriately handle america's nuclear weapons. ""i have grave doubts, to be honest with you,"" bush told cnn's jake tapper in an interview airing sunday on ""state of the union."" ""he's not taking the responsibility, the possibility of being president of the united states really seriously. for him, it looks as though he's an actor playing a role of the candidate for president. not boning up on the issues, not having a broad sense of the responsibilities of what it is to be a president,"" bush said. ""across the spectrum of foreign policy, mr. trump talks about things as though he's still on 'the apprentice.'"" bush said trump's proposed plan of hoping isis removes syrian president bashar assad from power and then russia taking on isis is like ""some kind of board game and not a serious approach."" ""this is just another example of the lack of seriousness. and this is a serious time. we're under grave threats again, and i think we need a president with a steady hand,"" bush said. bush again dismissed trump's suggestion that george w. bush was responsible for 9/11 because it occurred during his presidency. ""my brother responded to a crisis, and he did it as you would hope a president would do. he united the country, he organized our country and he kept us safe. and there's no denying that. the great majority of americans believe that,"" he said. ""and i don't know why he keeps bringing this up. it doesn't show that he's a serious person as it relates to being commander in chief and being the architect of a foreign policy,"" bush added. bush said his defense of the 43rd president's response to the attacks isn't just because he's his brother. ""i mean, so next week, mr. trump is probably going to say that fdr was around when japan attacked pearl harbor. it's what you do after that matters. and that's the sign of leadership,"" he said. ""you don't have to have your last name named bush to be able to understand that."" despite trump leading the polls, bush predicted that support for him will eventually fade.

the trump data card: key to winning the white house,"you can call donald trump a lot of things – and heaven knows almost everyone has – but you can’t call him stupid. he’s the lead story on every newscast, the hashtag of all hashtags on social media. and he’s gotten there by defying every convention. the bombastic billionaire has generated controversy and widespread contempt since he announced his candidacy for president in june, yet the latest new york times/cbs news poll gives him 35 percent of the republican vote – more than double the 16 percent of runner-up ted cruz. trump has defied the experts for six months, so have no doubt about it: he is very, very smart. he knows exactly what he’s doing. the feb. 1 iowa caucuses and the feb. 9 new hampshire primary are right around the corner, but two months is an eternity in american politics. there’s nothing that can’t be turned upside down in a few short weeks. and that’s why every other candidate for president, whether democrat or republican, should be spending a lot less time right now condemning what trump is saying. instead, they should be devoting their time and effort to learning why he’s winning. all they need to do is look at the data. politics is all about data now, and trump is generating more of it every day than all the other candidates combined in a week. but every time he says something provocative – which is pretty much every time he speaks – he creates data that can be captured, analyzed and turned against him. we live in a world where data controls everything, and i spend all my time studying how and why. in my case, because i’m a physician, it’s health data. but the principles are the same, and they’re why whoever best corrals the data trump is generating will be the next president of the united states. in an analysis of his strategy on thursday, the washington post reported that “trump uses his instagram account, which has more than 650,000 followers, to deliver snarky messages and short videos of him scowling as he delivers pronouncements from his trump tower desk. on twitter … trump has posted more than 6,000 tweets since launching his campaign in june.” there’s your data. trump – @realdonaldtrump – has 5.2 million followers on twitter. every tweet and retweet, every facebook post and share, every instagram blast, every newscast lead, every comment on everything … everyone’s talking about donald trump, which means he’s generating a trove of data that his opponents should be mining to their advantage. instead of climbing all over each other every day to condemn him, the other candidates should lean back, take a deep breath and learn from him – because the next president of the united states will be the man or woman who is smart enough to invest in the infrastructure that’s needed to organize and analyze the trump data trove. and with iowa and new hampshire coming up fast, the time to make that investment is now. does data analysis really work? ask barack obama; it’s why he’s been living in the white house for the last seven years. he is the master of using data to win elections by analyzing and identifying undecided voters, learning everything he could about each and every one of them, and then persuading them to vote for him in the final days of the campaign. jim messina, who headed obama’s re-election campaign in 2012, said recently that “every night for 18 months, we did 66,000 computer simulations of the election, and that’s how we based our tactics…. [w]e based it all on big data.” obama is the big data president, and trump gets that. the other candidates think traditional rhetoric and campaign slogans appeal to voters, but trump has tapped into something every tv producer and ad executive knows: times have changed. to get the ratings or to make the sale, you need to know the audience and make it yours. when advertisers want you to buy something, they provoke you. they grab your attention and use the data on what you’re watching to understand your behavior and reel you in. the same applies in television. nobody’s watching ""little house on the prairie"" anymore. the shows that get the ratings are the ones that are provocative, edgy, controversial. trump gets that, and he’s brought it to the presidential race. he’s shaking up the electorate, forcing them to react. you may not like what he’s saying, but you can’t deny that it’s working. he’s been at the top of the polls for months. but that, oddly enough, opens a door for whoever is smart enough to walk through it. a savvy opponent, instead of jumping on what trump is saying, should be jumping on how people are reacting to what he’s saying. trump has opened up a gold mine of data that any of his opponents can analyze to understand what people like – or don’t like – and why. from mexicans to mccain to muslims, all the trash talk and all the responses to it create data that a tech-savvy opponent should pounce on. it’s there for anyone who knows how to use it. “we spent two years and about $400 million trying to build up a capacity to predict people’s behaviors and match that with social media,” messina said, reflecting on obama’s re-election. “the final 96 hours of the 2012 race, a majority of americans, for the first time since 1972, went to the incumbent. and when you ask them why: 76 percent of those said because their friend or family member talked to them on social media and told them why they had to support barack obama.” any candidate who wants to be standing when trump falls should memorize those words. use the data he’s generating to learn everything you can about his supporters, and then make them yours. trump is smart. to beat him, an opponent has to be smart enough to move away from the chorus of critics and use the data he’s generating to defeat him. keep your base, analyze the data, win over his supporters … and the white house will be yours. dr. sreedhar potarazu is an acclaimed ophthalmologist and entrepreneur who has been recognized as an international visionary in the business of medicine and health information technology. he is the founder of vitalspring technologies inc., a privately held enterprise software company focused on providing employers with applications to empower them to become more sophisticated purchasers of health care. dr. potarazu is the founder and chairman of wellzone, a social platform for driving consumer engagement in health.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,2.4700000000000024,4.0,0.0,0.0

"thailand says closely watching myanmar crisis, ready to provide aid","bangkok (reuters) - thailand s foreign ministry, in a rare statement on an ongoing crisis in neighboring myanmar s rakhine state, said late on saturday that it was closely following the situation and would provide aid to the governments of myanmar and bangladesh. violence erupted in rakhine last month when rohingya militants attacked security posts, triggering a crackdown by the myanmar army. more than half a million ethnic rohingya - a mostly muslim minority who are denied citizenship by myanmar - have fled to bangladesh since then. those who fled accuse myanmar s army, backed by buddhist mobs, of a brutal killing campaign. the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing a sweeping government offensive in the north of rakhine state in response to those attacks. thailand is closely following the situation in the rakhine state with concern, the ministry said. the royal thai government has always placed great importance to providing care and protection to myanmar displaced persons, it added, pointing to some 100,000 refugees from myanmar who live in nine camps along the thai-myanmar border. but many of those living in the camps are long-term residents who fled conflict decades ago. none are rohingya, according to non-governmental organizations who work there. the thai foreign ministry said its statement was in response to views raised by some human rights groups regarding thailand s position on the unrest in rakhine. amnesty international last week said thailand must not push back rohingya fleeing violence and that it should provide refugees formal legal status and protection. thailand does not recognize the status of any refugees or recognize the rohingya as legitimate migrant workers. thailand said it supported a statement on the issue by the association of southeast asian nations (asean), a grouping of 10 nations. in the statement, asean foreign ministers condemned the attacks on myanmar s security forces and all acts of violence which resulted in loss of civilian lives . malaysia, an asean member, disassociated itself from the statement, saying it misrepresented issues relating to the exodus of hundreds of thousands of rohingya. so far, none of the affected victims from the august unrest in rakhine state have been found in thailand, the thai foreign ministry said.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,4.0,0.0,0.0
syria: british and american presence directly escalating conflict near al-tanf,"us paratrooper on security duty during a mission to train iraqi forces (photo: us department of defense. source: wikicommons)21st century wire says in southeastern syria, the region around al-tanf has quickly become a focal point for the ongoing conflict in the region. near to both the iraqi and jordanian borders, al-tanf is currently the location of a contingent of us-led coalition forces, supposedly there for the purpose of providing training to anti-isis militias, but also anti-assad militias too the fabled moderate rebels . not surprisingly, the us-led coalition has unilaterally imposed a self-styled deconfliction zone around their camp in al-tanf and claim to be defending their position from pro-syrian forces , otherwise known as the syrian arab army (saa) and allied militias. it has been reported by mainstream media outlets that coalition members represented at al-tanf include not only the united states but also the british sas, and also possibly norway too.although coalition forces are also present in other parts of syria, including the area around raqqa, an isis stronghold, the last few weeks have seen coalition forces striking syrian military targets on at least three occasions near the coalition training camp close to al-tanf including incidents on may 18th, june 6th and june 8th. it is now being reported that the us is supplying truck-mounted long range missiles to its forces near al-tanf, in a move that risks immediate escalation in the already-tense situation, and despite diplomatic efforts by russia to calm the situation. all this comes as the us and its kurdish proxy militia, the sdf, mount their attack on the isis stronghold raqqa in northeast syria. the us has also seized the opportunity to invade more syrian territory after an alleged sarin gas attack on april 4th that prompted president trump to launch a missile strike on a syrian airbase in retaliation.in the following segment filmed two weeks ago, 21wire editor patrick henningsen speaks to rt international about the recent us strike on syrian forces near al-tanf. henningsen explains how the us are taking advantage of the tension to secure its own territory inside of syria:. us and britain: a policy of deceptionone could easily be confused by the narrative that is being spun by the us, britain, and compliant mainstream media in both countries. less than two years ago, in 2015, then british prime minister david cameron ruled out sending british ground troops into syria. in mid-2016, however, it emerged that british special forces were engaged in combat in the country. between 2013 and 2015, former us president barack obama said on at least 16 occasions that there would be no boots on the ground in syria, but then changed his mind in late 2015 when us special forces were deployed into syria.president trump s statements are no less contradictory. on april 11th 2017, soon after his initial missile strikes on the syrian airbase, trump said that the us was not going into syria ; the current situation at al-tanf simply contradicts that statement.since that time, both britain and the us have been slowly ramping up their presence in syria, ostensibly to fight isis. but by repeatedly striking at syrian government forces the single most effective fighting force against isis the us and britain are actually helping isis to achieve its objectives.note the mismatch between the us-led coalition s presence in syria and how it s presented to the public. not only do they claim to be fighting isis while at the same time indirectly helping them, but they also call their attacks on syrian army targets defensive even though the syrian military has never attempted to attack any coalition forces. and it is similarly ironic that these strikes against the syrian military have occurred in what the coalition calls a deconfliction zone , where supposedly no conflict is allowed. according to security analyst charles shoebridge: these are self-declared [us occupied] zones of deconfliction. what they really mean there is that they are not allowing other people to enter these zones, notwithstanding that this is part of a sovereign country, syria what they mean is that actually conflict is allowed, and military forces, as long as they are american, british and their rebel allies. they are not agreed deconfliction zones. syria doesn t agree to them. russia, which of course has established de-escalation zones elsewhere in the country, hasn t agreed to this. consequently they really are, as [russian foreign minister] lavrov or his spokesman said, effectively unilateral zones. and not only is the narrative confusing, it is also not given the highest priority among mainstream headlines, with many other prominent stories conveniently serving to occupy the public while the situation in al-tanf escalates. in a week that saw congressmen shot at and injured at a baseball practice, a massive tower block fire in london taking at least 17 lives, and the uk election aftermath continuing to be unresolved, one could easily remain unaware of the escalating situation around al-tanf in syria. with the us-led coalition now directly and deliberately attacking syrian forces, what has been a proxy war is suddenly growing more dangerous, and the prospect of a direct conflict between nuclear-armed powers looms ever closer.as former british ambassador to syria peter ford remarked during a recent conversation with 21wire, the british military has neither syrian approval to be in syria, nor international approval from the un, nor even legislative approval from its own parliament. the same applies to the united states; although the us constitution gives the power to declare war exclusively to congress, the us now has quite a long history of entering wars or using deadly military force without congressional approval under the flexible guise of an authorization of force. more on this story from newsweek two syrian army tanks destroyed in a battle against moderate rebels , azaz, syria (photo: christiaan triebert. source: wikicommons)tom o connor newsweekrussia has demanded that the u.s. stop attacking forces that support the syrian government as they overtake positions held by the islamic state militant group (isis) on the country s border with iraq.russian foreign minister sergei lavrov reportedly made the comments saturday on a phone call with secretary of state rex tillerson, responding to three u.s. air strikes in the past few weeks against forces battling isis and other insurgent groups on behalf of russian-backed syrian president bashar al-assad. the pentagon has argued that the pro-syrian government coalition, which it describes as iran-backed militias, has breached a deconfliction zone declared by the u.s.-led international coalition in southern syria but not recognized by moscow or damascus. lavrov criticized the u.s. s moves, and the pair reportedly agreed to cooperate more closely in the future. lavrov expressed his categorical disagreement with the u.s. strikes on pro-government forces and called on him to take concrete measures to prevent similar incidents in future, russia s foreign ministry said in a statement, according to reuters.while the syrian army and its allies, which include russia, iran and various pro-government militias, advance toward the besieged eastern city of deir al-zour, held by isis since 2014, the u.s. has deployed special forces to train anti-assad rebels near the southern region of al-tanf. both factions are involved in the battle against isis but differ on syria s political future, with the former insisting that assad remains in power and the latter mostly advocating for his removal.continue this story at newsweekread more syria news at: 21st century wire syria filessupport our work by subscribing & becoming a member @21wire.tv",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,16.63,16.0,0.0,0.0
obama on baltimore: 'this is not new',"president barack obama on tuesday addressed the eruption of protests and riots in baltimore following the death of freddie gray, condemning the violent demonstrations while acknowledging that the underlying problems plaguing the city are ""not new"" and will require national ""soul-searching"" to solve. during a press conference with japan's prime minister, shinzo abe, obama was asked by nbc news' chris jansing about the growing frustration that not enough is being done in communities like baltimore. obama said his thoughts are with gray's family as well as the police injured in monday's protests, and he criticized the violent approach taken by some demonstrators. ""there's no excuse for the kind of violence we saw yesterday,"" he said. ""it is counterproductive. when individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot, they're not protesting. they're not making a statement. they're stealing. when they burn down a building they're committing arson, and they're destroying and undermining businesses and opportunities in their own communities that rob jobs and opportunities from people in that area."" ""they were constructive and they were thoughtful,"" he said of those demonstrations. ""and frankly it didn't get much attention. and one burning building will be looped on television ... and the thousands of demonstrators who did it the right way have been lost in the discussion."" he continued, ""since ferguson and the task force that we put together, we have seen too many incidences of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals -- primarily african-american, often poor -- in ways that raise troubling questions. it comes up, it seems like, once a week now. or once every couple of weeks. so i think its pretty understandable why the leaders of civil rights organizations, but more importantly moms and dads, might start saying this is a crisis. what i'd say is this has been a slow rolling crisis."" ""we have to own up to the fact that occasionally there are going to be problems here,"" he said. ""we can't just leave this to the police. i think there are police departments that have to do some soul-searching. i think there are some communities that have to do so some soul-searching. but i think we as a country have to do some soul-searching. this is not new. it's been going on for decades,"" he said. ""if we are serious about solving this problem, then we're going to not only help the police, we're going to have to think about what we can do, the rest of us."" ""that's hard. that requires more than just the occasional news report or task force,"" he said. ""if we really want to solve the problem, we could, it's just it would require everybody saying this is important, this is significant and that we just don't pay attention to these communities when a cvs burns. and we don't just pay attention when a man gets shot or has his spine snapped."" violent protests broke out in the maryland city on monday following the funeral for gray, the 25-year-old who died last week after suffering a spinal injury while in police custody. at least 15 police officers were injured and 27 individuals were arrested during monday's protests.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.682857142857145,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0

rappoport: ‘cnn already deflecting from the susan rice scandal’,"by jon rappoportcnn is already claiming the whole susan rice scandal is a tempest in a teapot, and the trump team is exaggerating it to distract the public from something. fill in the blank yourself.for example: trump isn t actually the president, he cheated his way into the oval office, while acting as a secret agent for his handler, vladimir putin, who in turn was operating on behalf of aliens from jupiter.the susan rice scandal is out in the open. she, obama s national security advisor, led an effort to spy on legal phone calls the trump team was making during the presidential campaign, in order to gain intelligence on the enemy. the daily caller news foundation (dcnf) spoke with col. (ret.) james waurishuk, an nsc [national security council] veteran and former deputy director for intelligence at the u.s. central command. waurishuk said: many hands had to be involved throughout the obama administration to launch such a political spying program it s unbelievable of [sic] the level and degree of the [obama] administration to look for information on donald trump and his associates, his campaign team and his transition team. this is really, really serious stuff . michael doran, former nsc [national security council] senior director, told the dcnf monday that somebody blew a hole in the wall between national security secrets and partisan politics . this was a stream of information that was supposed to be hermetically sealed from politics and the obama administration found a way to blow a hole in that wall , he said. yes, serious stuff. a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.obama, of course, will have plausible deniability if the susan rice scandal blows up into a watergate. he didn t know. he didn t order the spying. he was playing golf that day. or any day.and if a congressional investigation of rice and her antics reaches a fever pitch, somebody can play the race card. that s always an option. if rice were white, this never would have happened to her. the trump people are all over her like white on rice. meanwhile, cnn, in alternating segments, can say a) rice and her people never spied on anybody, and b) everybody spies on everybody all the time, it s not a big deal and then some on-air goofball will add, in fact, we here at cnn are spying and the tv screen will go blank, then display colored stripes, then come back and the goofball will be gone, and an anchor will say, we had a technical problem for a moment. continue this article at john rappoport s websiteread more russian hack news at: 21st century wire russian hack files",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.831111111111113,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0

trump whines that diverse ‘hamilton’ cast and audience opposed bigoted mike pence with insane twitter rant,"donald trump has a very thin skin. he has demonstrated this repeatedly; after all, he attacked the family of a fallen muslim-american soldier for daring to criticize his disparaging comments about muslims, and did the same to a beauty queen who had the guts to reveal how poorly he treated her when she was the reigning miss universe. he again did the same to a reporter with a disability by mocking him on national television via a rally, and has attacked countless other people who dared to speak out against him regarding negative experiences they have had by working with or for trump. his latest target? the cast of the great broadway musical hamilton. now, trump has taken to twitter to disparage the cast of the musical for the supposed harassment that his vice president-elect mike pence received when he decided to go to a showing of hamilton in super liberal new york city. pence, who has a long and disturbing record of anti-woman and anti-lgbtq positions and legislation, was booed at the production, and brandon victor dixon, who plays aaron burr in the musical, made an impassioned plea to pence to have an administration with trump that includes everyone. of course, trump could not let this perceived slight go, so he took to twitter to disparage the cast, creators, and dixon s statement to pence, saying:our wonderful future v.p. mike pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of hamilton, cameras blazing.this should not happen! donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 19, 2016the theater must always be a safe and special place.the cast of hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, mike pence. apologize! donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 19, 2016it s called free speech, pal. you have a vice president-elect who is easily one of the most anti-lgbtq political figures in the nation showing up at a new york city broadway musical that has the most diverse cast imaginable, including a star who is openly gay and hiv-positive. what did you expect? did you want the cast to kiss pence s ass? not happening. pence is getting the same level of respect he has shown the lgbtq community, which is absolutely none. make no mistake you re both getting exactly what you deserve. get used to it this will be your reception everywhere you go for the next four years, and it is definitely well deserved.featured image via scott eisen/getty images",1,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.825,13.9,0.0625,0.0

factbox: countdown to brexit breakthrough?,"brussels (reuters) - british prime minister theresa may failed to secure a breakthrough in brexit talks on monday with european commission president jean-claude juncker. here is a timeline of the coming 10 days that will determine whether britain avoids further costly delays in giving business assurances of a smooth exit from the european union and of free trade with its biggest market in the future: may wants the eu to open the second phase of brexit negotiations concerning relations after britain s withdrawal on march 30, 2019. the eu will only do that if there is sufficient progress in agreeing divorce terms, notably on three key issues: a financial settlement, guaranteed rights for eu citizens in britain and a soft border with ireland. a deal on money is effectively done, eu officials said last week. there are indications of agreement on citizens rights. but opposition from key allies in northern ireland to treating the province differently from the mainland in a bid to maintain on open eu land border with ireland scuppered a deal on monday. as part of the choreography for a political deal, the eu set may an absolute deadline of monday to provide new offers in time for the other eu leaders to approve a move to phase 2 at a summit of the eu-27 on friday, dec. 15. now, however, that has been pushed back by a few days, eu officials have conceded. may is pushing for a simultaneous, reciprocal guarantee from the eu of a soft transition and future trade deal, which she may use to show britons what her compromises have secured. the eu wants to have firm british offers which the 27 can discuss before leaders commit. the result is some complex dance steps: tuesday, dec. 5 eu summit chair donald tusk, having canceled a visit to jerusalem, had expected to call around eu leaders to discuss common guidelines for launching trade negotiations with britain. this and a series of other steps are now on hold. monday, dec. 11 eu-27 sherpas meet to prepare the summit. tuesday, dec. 12 eu affairs ministers of eu-27 meet to prepare summit. thursday, dec. 14 4 p.m. - may attends routine eu summit in brussels. defence, social affairs, foreign affairs and migration are on the agenda. friday, dec. 15 after may has left, eu-27 leaders hold brexit summit. they could take one comprehensive decision on phase 2 or break it down into separate ones on the transition and future ties. if may delays a divorce agreement until the summit, perhaps to show voters at home her resolve, this may delay opening trade talks. january - outline of eu transition offer may be ready, under which britain retains all rights except voting in the bloc, and meets all its obligations until the end of 2020. february - after agreeing their negotiating terms, eu-27 may be ready to open talks with london on a free trade pact that brussels likens to one it has with canada. the eu estimated at some 60 billion euros ($71 billion) what britain should pay to cover outstanding obligations on leaving. eu officials say there is now agreement after britain offered to pay an agreed share of most of the items brussels wanted, especially for committed spending that will go on after 2020. both sides say there is no precise figure as much depends on future developments. british newspaper reports that it would cost up to 55 billion euros sparked only muted criticism from may s hardline pro-brexit allies who once rejected big payments. irish prime minister leo varadkar said on saturday that london would be paying the eu 60 billion euros on brexit. barnier is still seeking a commitment that the rights of 3 million eu citizens who stay on in britain after brexit will be guaranteed by the european court of justice, not just by british judges. may has said the ecj should play no more role in britain. but the issue could be vital to ensure ratification of the withdrawal treaty by the european parliament. eu diplomats say a compromise may let british courts refer cases on citizens rights to the luxembourg-based ecj on a voluntary basis. irish premier leo varadkar said london agreed on monday that northern ireland would remain in regulatory alignment with the eu, and hence the irish republic, to ensure there was no hard border with police and customs checks that could disrupt peace. however, a hostile reaction from may s pro-brexit and pro-london allies the democratic unionist party (dup), on whom she depends for her slim parliamentary majority, caused may to hold off agreeing the package deal with juncker. the dup and many in may s own party fear that means separating the province from the british mainland - or forcing eu rules onto the whole of the uk. leaders of mainland regions scotland, wales and london leapt on the deal to demand similar freedom to perhaps remain in the eu customs union or single market, giving may a new headache. varadkar said he is willing to see changes in the text but not that would change its actual meaning.",0,5,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,7.600000000000001,2.0,0.0,0.0

the pope just took major step in abortion rights; conservatives livid,"while the united states and a few european countries seem to be taking a major right-hand political turn, pope francis made a stunning announcement in an apostolic letter on monday that is setting conservatives on fire. while he s far short of allowing full reproductive rights among catholics, he s decreed that women who ve had abortions don t have to go to hell.in the letter, pope francis granted a special dispensation to priests and bishops that would allow them to absolve the sins of abortion.while this dispensation might have thousands, if not more, catholic women breathing sighs of relief, the church isn t inviting abortion. in fact, the pope specifically wrote, i wish to restate as firmly as i can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life. however, in perhaps the church s first acknowledgement that women are people and not just birthing vessels, pope francis also said: in the same way, however, i can and must state that there is no sin that god s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the father. the letter continues: may every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation. i henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion. this move is incremental. in 1983, pope john paul allowed bishops to lift excommunications to women who ve had abortions. some bishops allowed priests to do the same, but this will be the first time that women around the world will be able to approach their priests, hoping they ll be granted forgiveness, with an actual chance of getting it.still, conservatives want none of it:@foxnews there has always been forgiveness it doesn t make the sin of killing ones own child less atrocious they she be shunned from society godblessamerica ??

nestle seeks more groundwater to expand michigan plant,"nestle seeks more groundwater to expand michigan plant they're putting profits over people - and the environment - yet again by julie fidler - november 9, 2016 the state of michigan has given a preliminary go-ahead for food and beverage maker nestle to nearly triple the amount of groundwater it will pump from beneath the state, to be bottled and sold at its ice mountain plant, approximately 120 miles from flint. nestle waters north america asked the michigan department of environmental quality (deq) to allow the company to increase pumping from 150 to 400 gallons-per-minute at 1 of its production wells north of evart. the company already increased the well’s pumping rate last year and earlier this year, but needs the deq’s approval to max out the withdrawal capacity under the section 17 of the michigan safe drinking water act (sdwa). the deq already issued a draft proposal for the request in january, and ended a public comment period on the subject on november 3. carrie monosmith, environmental health chief in the drinking water office, said the deq hadn’t received any comments. many michigan residents feel nestle has a lot of nerve asking for the increase, in light of flint’s years-long nightmare over lead contamination in their drinking water. many people in flint still rely on bottled water for cooking, cleaning, and bathing as the government continues to drag its feet in replacing the corroded pipes. nestle representatives defended the company’s efforts to pump more groundwater, saying the “u.s. market for bottled water in general is driving the bid for more michigan groundwater.” that’s right, america. nestle says it’s your fault. if that’s not infuriating enough, nestle gets to pump that water for free. under state law, private property owners may withdraw from the aquifer under their property for free. the only cost is $200 in annual paperwork. the interstate great lakes compact prohibits water diversions outside of the great lakes basin, but a loophole in the law allows water to be sold outside the region, so long as it is shipped in bottles smaller than 5.7 gallons. jeff ostahowski, vice president of the michigan citizens for water conservation (mcwc), asks: “the issue is the privatization of a critical resource. how much is too much?” for years, mcwc has battled against nestle to prevent it from expanding in the state. according to nestle and the deq, an environmental review shows the aquifer can withstand the proposed increase in pumping, and that it won’t hurt its flow, levels, or temperature of nearby surface waters.",1,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.180000000000003,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
why referendums aren’t as democratic as they seem - the new york times,"the voters of the world have had quite a year: they rejected colombia’s peace deal split britain from the european union endorsed a thai constitution that curtails democracy and, in hungary, backed the government’s plan to restrict refugees, but without the necessary turnout for a valid result. each of these moves was determined by a national referendum. though voters upended their governments’ plans, eroded their own rights and ignited political crises, they all accomplished one thing: they demonstrated why many political scientists consider referendums messy and dangerous. when asked whether referendums were a good idea, michael marsh, a political scientist at trinity college dublin, said, “the simple answer is almost never. ” “i’ve watched many of these in ireland, and they really range from the pointless to the dangerous,” he added. though such votes are portrayed as popular governance in its purest form, studies have found that they often subvert democracy rather than serve it. they tend to be volatile, turning not just on the merits of the decision but also on unrelated political swings or even, as may have happened in colombia, on the weather. voters must make their decisions with relatively little information, forcing them to rely on political messaging — which puts power in the hands of political elites rather than those of voters. “this is a tool that’s risky, but politicians keep using it because they think that they’ll win,” said alexandra cirone, a fellow at the london school of economics. but often they do not win, and instead of resolving political problems, the referendums create new ones. looking over the research on these votes, it becomes clear why many experts are skeptical. voters face a problem in any referendum: they need to distill difficult policy choices down to a simple yes or no, and predict the outcome of decisions so complex that even experts might spend years struggling to understand them. voters typically solve this problem by finding what the political scientists arthur lupia and mathew d. mccubbins have termed “short cuts. ” the voters follow the guidance of trusted authority figures or fit the choice within a familiar narrative. when a referendum is put forward by the government, people often vote in support if they like the leadership and vote in opposition if they dislike it, according to research by lawrence leduc, a political scientist and professor emeritus at the university of toronto. “a vote that is supposed to be about an important public issue ends up instead being about the popularity or unpopularity of a particular party or leader, the record of the government, or some set of issues or events that are not related to the subject of the referendum,” professor leduc wrote in a 2015 paper. in colombia, for example, most regions that voted for president juan manuel santos in 2014 also voted for the peace deal, and vice versa. voters may also cope with complex issues by shoehorning them into existing ideological beliefs. this dynamic plays out in virtually every referendum — especially those with higher stakes. politicians or other powerful actors will often reframe the referendum into simplistic, straightforward narratives. the result is that votes become less about the actual policy question than about contests between abstract values, or between which narrative voters find more appealing. in britain’s debate over whether to leave the european union, or “brexit,” neither side emphasized the specifics of membership in the bloc, instead framing the vote as a choice about which values to emphasize. the “remain” campaign presented membership as a matter of economic stability. the “leave” campaign emphasized immigration. it worked. people who voted to remain expressed great concern about the economy, but not much about immigrants. people who voted to leave said they were very concerned about immigration, and less so about the economy. in colombia, mr. santos presented the referendum as a vote on peace, but the opposition presented it as a decision on whether the country’s largest rebel group, the revolutionary armed forces of colombia, known as the farc, was entitled to leniency. neither narrative fully portrayed the question of whether the peace deal would be worthwhile. colombia, ms. cirone said, also highlighted that “in contexts where the referendum addresses a historical political issue, it may be hard for voters to separate past experiences with what is best for the country in the future. ” in thailand, the government held a referendum in august to approve a new constitution that would entrench its power and curtail elements of democracy. but the military also promised elections only after the constitution passed, in effect selling an document as the choice. the measure passed. though presented as putting power in the hands of the people, referendums are often intended to put a stamp of popular legitimacy on something leaders have already decided to do. “it doesn’t have a lot to do with whether this should be decided by the people,” ms. cirone said. “it has to do with whether a politician can gain an advantage from putting a question to the people. ” for example, david cameron, until july the british prime minister, held the vote on whether to depart the european union expecting that it would bolster his decision to stay in the bloc and would thus silence british politicians who wanted to leave. the thai military restricted news coverage of the draft constitution, ensuring that there was no counternarrative that might portray it as a threat to democracy. by giving the appearance of popular input, the military in fact dampened it. prime minister viktor orban of hungary most likely devised his country’s referendum — on whether to reject european union requirements for accepting refugees — to inevitable objections in the bloc to his policies and to bolster his political standing at home. in both cases, it was about using the vote as an instrument to strengthen himself. this stamp of popular legitimacy, though, can sometimes be a good thing, settling contentious national disputes that might otherwise lead to political turmoil or even to armed conflict. but it is precisely because the stakes are so high that the risks are, as well. northern ireland’s good friday peace deal in 1998 was followed by two referendums, one in northern ireland and one in the republic of ireland. that gave communities a sense of having been included, and marginalized anyone who wanted to keep fighting, making a relapse into conflict less likely. this shows an important way referendums are different from regular elections: they succeed only when the nation perceives the vote as reflecting popular will. that works best if turnout is high and one side wins in a landslide, as happened in northern ireland’s 1998 vote. but in colombia, turnout was just 38 percent, and the vote was split almost perfectly down the middle, meaning a few thousand people swung the outcome. even if the referendum had passed, it would have failed to give the peace deal popular legitimacy. that problem can be solved by requiring high turnout and a landslide victory for a referendum to be binding, ms. cirone said. but in a puzzling decision, neither colombia nor britain required more than 50 percent of the vote for either side to win. a close result like colombia’s can risk deepening political disputes rather than bridging them. leaders have to choose whether to accept a result that does not demonstrably reflect popular will, or reject the result and risk a political backlash or a constitutional crisis. national referendums can also be extremely volatile, driven by factors unrelated to the issue’s merits and outside anyone’s control. opinion polls are often misleading because people do not form their opinions until immediately before the vote. tellingly, they often abandon those views just as quickly. professor marsh of trinity college dublin said he had found, in some cases, that “most people can’t remember any arguments for — this is about a week later — they can’t remember any arguments against, and they’re not really quite sure why they voted yes or no. ” he added, “that doesn’t inspire me, really, with referendums. ” the ambient noise of politics can also distort popular will: whether one party is up or down in the polls, whether intraparty infighting over the vote spills into public, and how the news media portrays related issues all play a role. votes are also subject to random factors, including the weather. in colombia, turnout for the referendum may have been depressed by a hurricane that hit the day before, forcing evacuations in some areas. “the idea that somehow any decision reached anytime by majority rule is necessarily ‘democratic’ is a perversion of the term,” kenneth rogoff, an economics professor at harvard, wrote after britain’s vote to leave the european union. “this isn’t democracy it is russian roulette for republics,” he

china sales vroom in 2016 for global automakers; dull 2017 looms,"beijing (reuters) - global automakers reported a surge in china sales last year as consumers rushed to take advantage of a tax cut on small-engine cars, but cautioned 2017 would be tougher for the industry as the incentive is rolled back and the broader economy slows. toyota motor corp, ford motor co and nissan motor co ltd on friday each reported sales growth of 8 percent or better for 2016, although honda motor co ltd led the pack with a 24 percent growth. toyota, which reported an 8.2 percent rise in china sales last year, sees growth slowing in 2017 as slightly higher taxes keep some buyers away from the world’s biggest auto market. it expects to sell at least 1.2 million vehicles, steady from 2016. “we are not being strictly volume focused. we would like to do so (increase volumes) while boosting car quality and keep our customer base satisfied with our products and service,” a beijing-based toyota spokesman told reuters. while honda expects to sell more vehicles in china this year, it forecast a significantly slower growth rate of 7.4 percent, roughly in line with a slowing economy. demand for cars in china got a shot in the arm in 2016 ahead of a planned expiry of lower taxes at year-end. sales will come under pressure this year, but not fall sharply, given a decision to slowly roll back the incentive instead of abruptly ending it. the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or smaller in china, at 5 percent now, will rise to 7.5 percent this year before returning to 10 percent in 2018. overall passenger car sales in china could have dropped 2 percent this year had the tax cut expired on dec. 31, but are now expected to grow by 3-5 percent, consultancy automotive foresight said. analysts, however, cautioned that car sales could fall in the first quarter as consumers fearing the policy would end in 2016 moved ahead their purchases instead of waiting until 2017. “in late 2016 we definitely saw pull forward effects in engines below 1.6 liter. this will effect the q1 negatively,” a sales executive at a major foreign automaker told reuters. honda posted the biggest growth in china sales last year among automakers reporting friday, powered by a steady stream of new models, mainly in the hot sport-utility vehicle segment. vehicle sales by honda rose to 1.25 million in 2016, while ford reported a growth of 11.9 percent to 1.24 million vehicles. but with premium lincoln brand car sales, which are not consistently included in monthly data releases, ford’s sales totaled 1.27 million, giving it an edge over toyota and honda. all three, however, continued to lag nissan motor co ltd in china sales. nissan’s sales grew 8.4 percent to 1.35 million vehicles in the country last year. general motors co and volkswagen continue to be the market leaders in china. on thursday, gm and its joint venture partners reported sales of 3.87 million vehicles in china for 2016, up 7.1 percent. the full-year figures come in spite of sales slipping for several brands in the final month, with gm, honda and toyota all reporting a year-on-year drop for december with news china was not completely ending its tax incentive making its impact felt.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.863636363636363,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0
hardcore conservative republican senator blasts trump’s decision to kill daca,"donald trump s decision to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program (daca) is so toxic that even one of his most hardcore conservative republican supporters in the senate opposes it.it s safe to say that oklahoma senator james lankford is one of trump s most ardent supporters. after all, lankford votes with trump s position nearly 96 percent of the time, and he backed trump during the 2016 election.but lankford is breaking with trump when it comes to killing daca.daca was put in place by president obama to help children who were brought to the united states by their parents. america is where they grew up and it is the only home they have ever really known. daca was created to give them a path to citizenship and over 800,000 have applied.deporting these people is heartless, especially since they would be deported to countries they have never really lived in.trump s decision to end daca has been criticized by republicans and democrats alike, and has drawn outrage from the american people. trump s racist supporters, of course, support his decision.but some republicans, like lankford, oppose it. it is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally, lankford said in a statement. however, we as americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents. we must confront the nation s out-of-date immigration policy and finally resolve the issues of strong border enforcement and merit immigration, lankford continued. policy reform must come from the american people through congress. the legislative and executive branch should put aside passivity and partisanship and finally modernize our immigration laws. that s nice, but if lankford really supports daca he will put his money where his mouth is and introduce a bill to enshrine it in law. anything less would reveal his statement to be a lie designed to save his own ass from the wrath of voters who oppose trump s decision.trump intends to make an official announcement on tuesday. let s hope the outrage and opposition are enough to make him change his mind.featured image via ron sachs pool/getty images",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.270000000000007,20.0,0.1,0.0

facebook faces high profile lawsuit regarding facial recognition technology ‘deepface’,"at 3:02 pm leave a comment as the technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous and far more accurate, facial recognition and the lack of any laws or regulations around the practice is slowly starting to enter mainstream consciousness. it’s a very important issue that isn’t getting the attention it deserves. for example, as i highlighted in the recent post, half of american adults exist in a government accessible facial recognition network : half of all american adults are already in some sort of facial recognition network accessible to law enforcement, according to a comprehensive new study. conducted over a year and relying in part on freedom of information and public record requests to 106 law enforcement agencies, the study , conducted by georgetown law’s center on privacy and technology, found american police use of facial recognition technology is a scattered, hodgepodge network of laws and regulations. “looking at the sum total of what we found, there have been no laws that comprehensively regulate face recognition technology, and there’s really no case law either,” clare garvie, an associate at the cpt, told vocativ. “so we find ourselves having to rely on the agencies that are using that technology to rein it in. but what we found is that not every system — by a long shot — has a use policy.” with that in mind, bloomberg published an interesting article yesterday covering a couple of lawsuits against facebook and google regarding their facial recognition practices. here’s some of what we learned: while millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos, others worried there’s something devious afoot are trying block facebook as well as google from amassing such data. as advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data, privacy advocates see a pattern in how the world’s largest social network and search engine have sold users’ viewing histories for advertising. the companies insist that gathering data on what you look like isn’t against the law, even without your permission. if judges agree with facebook and google, they may be able to kill off lawsuits filed under a unique illinois law that carries fines of $1,000 to $5,000 each time a person’s image is used without permission — big enough for a liability headache if claims on behalf of millions of consumers proceed as class actions. a loss by the companies could lead to new restrictions on using biometrics in the u.s., similar to those in europe and canada. facebook declined to comment on its court fight. google declined to comment on pending litigation. facebook encourages users to “tag” people in photographs they upload in their personal posts and the social network stores the collected information. the company uses a program it calls deepface to match other photos of a person. alphabet inc.’s cloud-based google photos service uses similar technology. the billions of images facebook is thought to be collecting could be even more valuable to identity thieves than the names, addresses, and credit card numbers now targeted by hackers, according to privacy advocates and legal experts. and just how good is facebook’s technology? according to the company’s research, deepface recognizes faces with an accuracy rate of 97.35 percent compared with 97.5 percent for humans — including mothers. rotenberg said the privacy concerns are twofold: facebook might sell the information to retailers or be forced to turn it over to law enforcement — in both cases without users knowing it. now here’s some history on facebook and facial recognition. facebook v. privacy law december 2005 — facebook introduces photo tagging october 2008 — illinois adopts biometric information privacy act june 2012 — facebook acquires israeli facial recognition developer face.com september 2012 — facebook ceases facial recognition in europe 2015-2016 — facebook, google, shutterfly and snapchat sued under illinois biometrics law. shutterfly settles confidentially. may 2016 — illinois lawmaker proposes excluding photos from biometrics law, then shelves bill after privacy advocates complain october 2016 — facebook makes second attempt to get biometrics lawsuit thrown out the facebook case is in re facebook biometric information privacy litigation, 15-cv-03747, u.s. district court, northern district of california (san francisco). the google cases are rivera v. google, 16-cv-02714, and weiss v. google, 16-cv-02870, u.s. district court, northern district of illinois (chicago). for prior articles on the topic, see:",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,16.63,16.0,0.0,0.0
bundy militia fans continue threats to kill oregon authorities,"more than two months after bundy militia idiot robert lavoy finicum was shot and killed during a standoff with federal and state police, authorities say officials are still receiving death threats.according to reports, the police have documented at least 80 threats against various officials okay including governor kate brown. one bundy fan club member left a message at the governor s office saying: you killed an unarmed rancher, so now one of you must die. the seattle times reports:the governor s office reported friday that threats related to the standoff and finicum shooting continue to come in against brown.one email demanded the release of refuge occupiers jailed on federal charges. it also demanded indictments for the officers involved in finicum s death. if that doesn t happen, the writer said, i am going to begin returning fire. last month, the fbi released video of the shooting that left finicum dead, and you can clearly see that he was reaching for his weapon when police opened fire. in spite of video evidence that exonerated the officers and proved that the imbecile known as tarp man was a violent thug, right-wingers insist the shooting was not justified. and to make things right, they want to murder police officers and the governor. that s insane.in addition to the continued death threats, authorities discovered that people hell-bent on retaliation are aggressively hunting the names of the officers who were involved in the shooting. this further highlights how important it is to keep those names from the public according to malheur county district attorney dan norris.although the governor has said the officers names will eventually be released, it s definitely better that they are kept quiet right now. the people who are making the threats are missing some screws. it doesn t matter how much evidence is put forth that proves their outrage is completely unfounded, they ve made up their minds. their actions are proof of what constant anti-government rhetoric does to people. and there is one party to blame for that: republicans.for years, tea party republicans have been spewing hate to their voters and telling them the government wants to hurt them. they do this knowing that the sovereign citizen movement that the bundy militia belonged to is one of the biggest threats to law enforcement. so, the next time you hear conservatives saying, blue lives matter! show them this and tell them .featured image via joe raedle/getty images",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.831111111111113,21.37777777777778,0.1111111111111111,0.0

u.s. appeals court hears arguments on trump travel ban,"seattle/san francisco (reuters) - a u.s. appeals court on wednesday wrestled with a bid by president donald trump to show that his latest travel ban targeting people from six muslim-majority countries is legal. the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals hearing in seattle came two days after the u.s. supreme court allowed trump’s travel ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds. the ban targets people from chad, iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen seeking to enter the united states. the republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the united states from terrorism. the state of hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a honolulu federal judge said it exceeded trump’s powers under immigration law. trump’s ban also covers people from north korea and certain government officials from venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. the same three judge 9th circuit panel which limited a previous version of trump’s ban heard arguments on wednesday. some of the judges appeared more cautious toward the idea of blocking the president’s policy. judge michael daly hawkins asked hawaii’s lawyers whether trump’s latest proclamation is more sound than prior versions. the current one, he said, is based on specific findings that some foreign governments do not share enough information to properly vet immigrants. “you would trust kim jong un to say this person is this person, you gotta let him in?” hawkins said. judge ronald gould said the court would issue a ruling “as soon as practicable.” trump issued his first travel ban targeting several muslim-majority countries in january, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests. he issued a revised one in march after the first was blocked by federal courts. that expired in september after a long court fight, and was replaced with the current version. the ban has some exceptions. certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals is set to hear a separate challenge to the ban on friday, and the u.s. supreme court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.964444444444446,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
bernie sanders shows strong momentum on social media,"new york (reuters) - it may be too close to call between democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders in the iowa caucuses on monday, but the senator from vermont was the clear winner on social media. sanders maintained his strong social media presence during the caucuses, commanding the majority of the twitter mentions over clinton. sanders was mentioned over 77,000 times on twitter during the caucus, while clinton was mentioned 52,000 times, according to social media sentiment analytics firm brandwatch. clinton, the democratic front-runner and former secretary of state, was in a virtual tie with sanders with more than 93 percent of iowa precincts reporting. sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, amassed the largest number of new facebook followers of any candidate in the race during monday, the social network said, topping republican presidential front-runner donald trump by 15,695 to 10,704. clinton had the third most new followers, with 6,210 liking her page in the past day. among republicans, trump finished second in the caucuses to ted cruz, the u.s. senator from texas. sanders resonated with millennial social media users as well. social media platform yik yak, which is particularly popular among younger social media users, said sanders was mentioned in 60 percent of all yaks that discussed a democratic candidate during the caucuses. while social media buzz does not necessarily translate into votes, it is a good indication of the interest level surrounding a candidate. the iowa contest was the first of the state-by-state battles to pick nominees for the nov. 8 election to succeed president barack obama. google trends data also showed strong interest in sanders. in iowa, sanders was the top-searched-for democratic candidate on the search engine, with 52 percent of queries relating to the democratic candidates. clinton commanded 42 percent of queries. even so, trump was the top most-searched for presidential candidate overall, according to the most recent google search data available.

northern ireland: life inside the fountain,"londonderry, northern ireland (reuters) - william jackson remembers the exodus vividly, when over 10,000 protestants fled the west bank of londonderry s river foyle for the city s suburbs as northern ireland s troubles erupted. almost 50 years on jackson is among some 250 protestants who stayed and carved out a tiny enclave known as the fountain , a tight, fiercely pro-british community that is separated by high walls and fences from the surrounding irish nationalist heartland. you are not talking one or two families, you are talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, jackson said, recalling the flight which began in 1969 when british troops were sent to the city to quell unrest over a civil rights campaign launched by the catholic minority. three decades of bloodshed followed between catholic irish nationalists, seeking to unite with ireland, and pro-british protestant loyalists, who want to remain part of the united kingdom. around 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace agreement. much of northern ireland has since been transformed, yet in many areas the two sides remain separated by so-called peace walls . the fences of up to 15 meters set up in the years after 1969 were supposed to be temporary but many still remain. in the fountain, the metal gate in the wall between it and the nearby bogside area - home to the late irish nationalist hero martin mcguinness - is locked at 9 p.m. each night and it remains one of the province s flashpoints when sporadic violence breaks out. we stayed here because we re hardcore, said jackson. we managed to stay as a small community and it s always been that way. nationalists wouldn t be welcome to live here, even today. just the same as protestants wouldn t be made welcome in the bogside. it s just one of those things unfortunately. social codes are so ingrained that it is virtually unheard for people to spend time in the opposing community s neighborhood but anyone who did could face threats or a beating from local hardliners. outsiders , as locals refer to protestants not originally from the area, have moved in but only last around five or six years, according to jackson, who runs the local heritage tower museum, one the smallest galleries in northern ireland. you have families that come and spend a year and they go because of the way of life here, he said. some of the police have actually referred to us as like rats living in a cage. the area remains blighted by poverty and many houses remain derelict. some residents say they disconnect their electricity periodically to save money. at the fountain s cathedral youth club, jeanette warke has spent the last 45 years providing an education and recreational outlet to three generations of youngsters who went from dodging bullets to fighting unemployment. warke has seen the fountain change over that time and now concentrates on better integrating local catholic and protestant children. last year she brought them to dublin for the centenary of the irish uprising that led to independence from britain and to france for a commemoration of the world war one battle of the somme. we ve really opened up big avenues for these young people, protestant and catholic to look at their history, said warke, who still works at the age of 73 and has been honored by britain s queen for her services to young people. you re not looking to change young people s mindsets and to take them away from their own culture, that s not what we are about. we re looking to create a better understanding and also respect for each other and that to me is very, very important. however jackson, warke and other locals think it s still too soon to tear down the walls between protestants who call their city londonderry and catholics who refer to it simply as derry. there s more work to do, warke said. until then, the fountain community will remain as tight as ever. my mother says the only time she will leave the fountain is in a box, said 38-year-old daphne atkinson, a fellow youth club worker. she s proud of where she s from which is a good thing so she ll not leave only when it s her time to go.",0,6,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.383333333333333,9.066666666666668,0.0,0.0

isn’t he very busy?” the mayor, cheng said in a television interview that aired on nov. 18, referring to ms. chen’s group. “they said she is a company representative. his company is still continuing to look for the world’s best real estate projects, and they very much understand taiwan. ” “she had authorization documents issued by the trump company,” he said, without specifying. the mayor’s office, in a nov. 16 statement, said that although investment opportunities had been discussed, the meeting had not resulted in any agreement, and that the election had not been talked about. the mayor’s office did not respond to a request for comment for this article. on friday, amanda miller, a spokeswoman for the trump organization, said that there were “no plans for expansion into taiwan” and that there had been no “authorized visits” to taiwan to push for a development project. asked on sunday for clarification about the company’s relationship with ms. chen and knowledge of her activity in taiwan, ms. miller did not respond to specific questions. she instead repeated in a statement that there had been “no authorized visits to taiwan on behalf of our brand for the purposes of development, nor are there any active conversations. ” the sept. 8 meeting, and its confirmation in november, went largely unnoticed outside taiwan until friday, when mr. trump, the received a congratulatory phone call from the island’s president, tsai . the call is believed to have been the first conversation between a taiwanese leader and a united states president or in close to four decades, and it threatens to upend the delicate united relationship because beijing views any communication with taiwan’s leaders as an affront to its claim of sovereignty over the island. and even if it emerges that ms. chen was largely freelancing, and not acting on behalf of the trump organization, the perception of a possible business conflict in taiwan further complicates the relationship. potential conflicts of interest for mr. trump as president have been documented around the world, including in scotland, india, brazil, the philippines, argentina and turkey. but perhaps nowhere are the stakes quite as high as in taiwan, because it involves ties between the united states and china, the countries with the world’s biggest economies and most powerful militaries. “even if the phone call had not happened, once these business dealings came to light, it would send a very confusing signal to beijing,” said marc lanteigne, a senior research fellow at the norwegian institute of international affairs who focuses on chinese security issues. any business ties could undermine the near certainty that world leaders have had for many decades about some of the basic foundations of united states foreign policy, which has included the primacy of maintaining ties with china in a “very narrow framework,” said shelley rigger, a professor of political science at davidson college in north carolina who studies states relations. “it is very worrisome not just for leaders in china but for leaders everywhere to think that there could be motivations driving u. s. foreign policy that they can’t, a, know about and, b, work out logically,” professor rigger said by telephone. “if the u. s. government is being influenced by some kind of parallel set of side deals and interests that are not the sort of mainstream u. s. foreign policy and national interest agenda, then no one is going to be able to predict anything. ” adding to the complexity is the fact that the taoyuan aerotropolis is a development project, and ms. tsai’s administration must give final approval for the complex plan, which involves removing many people from their homes, before construction can begin. taoyuan is the center of a metropolitan area with over two million residents. ms. chen — who, according to online biographies of her, was raised in las vegas — has been associated with the trump organization for several years, and with ms. lu, the former vice president, for much longer. in december 2012, a photograph of the two women was posted on the facebook page of the condominium sales arm of trump international realty in las vegas, thanking them for visiting. ms. chen also accompanied ms. lu, who was then the vice president, during a trip to las vegas in 2004. “the trump organization said: ‘hey, ms. chen, your business and politics connections seem great. do you want to help us promote our las vegas properties? ’” ms. chen said in an interview with a taiwanese television station in late october. ms. lu, reached on her mobile phone, did not comment. ms. chen could not be reached for comment. in an interview with the wall street journal, ms. chen said she had a letter saying she was a “sales ambassador” for mr. trump’s company but was not an employee. ms. chen’s visit was followed in october by a visit to taipei by a trump organization employee. the duties of the executive, donoghue, include trying to find guests for the company’s hotels worldwide. ms. donoghue, who is not part of the company’s development team, did not respond to requests for comment. ms. miller of the trump organization would not specify with whom she had met during her visit to taiwan. ms. chen, who once headed nevada’s economic development office in taiwan, has been outspoken about her admiration for mr. trump, though it is unclear how much is . “the election demonized trump,” she said in the television interview. “but in my experience and close interactions with him, he is very nice, has great bearing, has a very good head for business and really respects women. ”",0,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.566666666666666,8.666666666666668,0.0,0.0

cartel human smugglers increase fees in trump’s wake,"president donald trump’s tougher border security and immigration enforcement plans have driven up human smuggling fees being charged by coyotes. [“we are seeing an increase in the fees charged by human smugglers along the u. s. southwest border,” department of homeland security (dhs) secretary john f. kelly said in a written statement obtained by breitbart texas. “since nov. 2016, ‘coyotes’ have hiked their fees in some areas by roughly 130 percent — from $3, 500 to $8, 000 in certain mountainous regions. ” kelly attributed the increased fees charged to newly implemented changes in dhs policy regarding the detention of apprehended aliens. “as directed in my memoranda implementing the president’s executive orders, we remain committed to carrying out fair, impartial and humane enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws,” kelly wrote. coyotes have become dependent on human smuggling fees, often earning as much from smuggling people as drug runs. breitbart texas reported in the days before the november 2016 election, smugglers were using the contest as a “marketing tool” to get people to travel in advance. “the cartel uses what happens in the u. s. as a marketing tool in central america,” mcallen mayor jim darling said during an exclusive interview with breitbart texas. “the need is there (in central america) but what happens in washington and the way the news media presents it, they (cartels) say you better get up here. so that causes the surges. we”ll see what happens after the election to see if it slows down. ” after the election, it did not slow down. the months of november, december, and january, all saw increases in apprehensions compared to the same months in the prior year. following the release of december’s numbers showing a large increase in apprehensions, particularly in the rio grande valley sector, supervisory border patrol agent marlene castro said, “we’re not a deterrent because they’re looking for us, so we can be standing there and [the smuggler will] still send them across,” during an interview with fox news channel’s william la jeunesse. “it’s been a group, and then maybe five minutes later another group, and then half an hour later you’ll see another one. ” with the swearing in of president trump in january, the numbers finally began to subside. while still higher than january 2016, the numbers were down from december. the first full month of the trump administration brought a dramatic drop in migrant apprehensions between ports of entry along the southwest border. apprehensions not only dropped from january to february they dropped to the lowest level of any month in the past five years. “the drop in apprehensions shows a marked change in trends,” secretary kelly said. “since the administration’s implementation of executive orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years. ” “since president trump took office on january 20, we have seen a dramatic drop in numbers,” kelly stated. “we will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between march and may. however, the early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact. ” “the decrease is also encouraging news because it means many fewer people are putting themselves and their families at risk of exploitation, assault, and injury by human traffickers and the physical dangers of the treacherous journey north,” the dhs secretary concluded. bob price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for breitbart texas. he is a founding member of the breitbart texas team. follow him on twitter @bobpricebbtx.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.230000000000004,3.2,0.0,0.0
georgia says suspect in istanbul airport bombing killed last week,"tbilisi (reuters) - a former islamic state fighter suspected of masterminding a deadly attack on istanbul airport in 2016 was killed during a special operation in ex-soviet georgia last week, a spokeswoman for georgia s state security service said on friday. akhmed chatayev was named by turkish media and a u.s. congressman as the mastermind of the suicide bombing of istanbul airport in 2016 which killed 45 people. his involvement has not been corroborated by turkish officials. it s confirmed that one of those killed during the operation is akhmed chatayev, nino giorgobiani, a spokeswoman for georgia s state security service, told a news briefing. giorgobiani said that chatayev blew himself up. one georgian special forces serviceman and two other members of the armed group, which was suspected of terrorism, were killed in the same operation. four police officers were wounded and one member of the group was also arrested. the 20-hour operation took place at an apartment block on the outskirts of the georgian capital tbilisi last week. giorgobiani declined to name the two other armed men killed or disclose the identity of the member of the group who was arrested, the group s motives, or how they got to georgia. the investigation is ongoing ... we continue to work with our international partners to identify the other two (armed men), giorgobiani said. she said that experts from the united states had been participating in the investigation. a united nations sanctions list describes chatayev as a senior figure in islamic state responsible for training russian-speaking militants. a veteran of chechnya s conflict with moscow during which he lost an arm, he lived in georgia s pankisi gorge, a remote area populated largely by people from the kist community, ethnic chechens whose ancestors came to mainly christian georgia in the 1800s. when, after the collapse of the soviet union, chechnya rose up in an armed rebellion against moscow s rule, the kist community were drawn to the fight. thousands of refugees arrived from chechnya, and some insurgents used the gorge to regroup and prepare new attacks. chatayev was wounded and arrested in georgia in august 2012 following a clash between the georgian police and a group of militants, who were allegedly trying to cross the georgian-russian border and move to dagestan.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.190000000000001,8.0,0.1,0.0

huguenard cites credible evidence, indicating the clinton foundation is largely a money laundering, influence peddling racket. less than 10% of “tens of millions of dollars donated” went for charitable purposes, the rest for self-enrichment. “there is ample evidence already in the public record that the clinton foundation qualifies as a criminal enterprise and there’s no doubt that the fbi is privy to significantly more evidence than has already been made public,” said huguenard. if comey recommends attorney general lynch indict hillary clinton, it’s unlikely she’ll prosecute a woman she’s had close ties to for years. bill clinton appointed her us attorney for the eastern district of new york – serving from 1999 – 2001. from 2003 – 2005, she was a wall street controlled new york federal reserve bank of new york board member – the mother bank most complicit with its member bank crooks. from 2002 – 2010, she was a washington-headquartered hogan & hartson (h & h) law firm partner. its new york-based partner howard topaz filed income tax returns for bill and hillary clinton, beginning in 2004. in may 2004, h & h filed patent trademark documents for denver-based mx logic inc., the computer software firm responsible for developing email encryption technology used to manage hillary’s private email server, beginning in july 2013. judicial watch president tom fitton according to judicial watch president tom fitton, if h & h (now hogan lovells following a 2010 merger) “represented the clintons on tax matters,” lynch is responsible for disclosing any involvement she may have had, direct or indirect. in april 2008 during hillary’s first presidential campaign, the american lawyer called h & h one of her largest legal industry supporters. partner christine varney was chief counsel to the clinton/gore 1992 campaign. the ties between h & h, lynch and the clintons are longstanding. in november 2014, obama announced her appointment as attorney general, succeeding eric holder, effective april 27, 2015 after senate confirmation. it’s hard imagining her biting a hand contributing greatly to her career advancement. key for clinton is how much more of her dark side becomes public knowledge besides what’s already known. if enough despite lynch declining to indict and supportive media scoundrels downplaying or whitewashing her offenses, the democratic (sic) national committee (dnc) might be forced to jettison her as damaged goods. she’d be red meat for trump to take full advantage of in the fall campaign. would bernie sanders party bosses don’t want become democrat standard bearer in july? or will joe biden or another high-profile party member perhaps be chosen as a late-stage establishment nominee, a brokered convention manipulating things? america’s political system is too debauched to fix. duopoly power eliminates governance of, by and for everyone equitably. republicans and democrats are two sides of the same coin – special interests served exclusively, ordinary people betrayed, the same outcome every electoral cycle. whoever succeeds obama, likely worse than ever governance will follow. the greatest concern is preventing possible ww iii. clinton’s rage for endless wars, along with her sino/russian hostility makes the unthinkable possible. stephen lendman lives in chicago. he can be reached at . his new book as editor and contributor is titled “flashpoint in ukraine: us drive for hegemony risks ww iii.” http://www.claritypress.com/lendmaniii.html . visit his blog site at sjlendman.blogspot.com. a historical milestone need not come at the expense of america.",1,18,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,10.266666666666667,0.0,0.0
"watch: house dem has had enough, formally starts impeachment proceedings against trump","donald trump is a clear and present threat to the united states of america. that fact is indisputable at this point; after all, a senator in his own party just said so in strikingly blunt terms. however, the gop-controlled house has been silent on trump s dangerous antics, because they fear his lighting them up on twitter, and they also fear retaliation by his crazy base at the ballot box. but it seems that rep. al green (d- tx) has had enough.on wednesday afternoon, rep. green took the floor of the house of representatives and formally introduced articles of impeachment against trump. green began: i rise today on behalf of the many who have concluded that enough is enough. green went on to say that trump s being in the white house is is fueling an alt-right hate machine, which is currently causing immediate injury to american society. on top of that, green introduced his articles as privileged, meaning that the house needs to take them up within the next two days.now, obviously this will go nowhere. those craven republicans don t care that trump is destroying the country, just as long as they get every bigoted right-wing fever dream they ve had for the last eight years codified into law, with a few tax cuts for rich people thrown in, oh, just for fun.in short, these republicans know that trump is unfit, and could even land us in a nuclear holocaust if he can t be kept away from the nuclear codes. in fact, at this point, any responsible person will do what was done to president nixon in his final days, when he reportedly was drinking heavily and wandering the halls of the white house conversing with portraits of dead presidents. at that time, secretary of state henry kissinger and soon-to-be president gerald ford insisted that those responsible for launching nuclear weapons went through them rather than nixon, because they knew nixon to be dangerous.general john kelly, secretary of state rex tillerson, and other adults in the room had better be doing the same with trump, who is much more dangerous than nixon ever dreamed of being.please, someone show some courage in the republican house and go along with rep. green. it s time to impeach trump.watch rep. green s remarks below:featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",1,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.756666666666668,14.8,0.0,0.0
poll: clinton's lead over trump slips after florida shooting,"the poll, conducted from monday to friday, showed clinton, the presumptive democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over trump, her likely republican rival in the november presidential election. that's down from a lead of 14.3 points for clinton on sunday, the day an american-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group islamic state killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in orlando, florida. trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the united states from any country with a ""proven history of terrorism"" against america and its allies if elected. the pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in paris and california, to ban the entry of all muslims into the united states. he also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the republican party's general opposition to gun control. while trump's comments on both muslims and guns dismayed some republican elites, they may have cheered some voters. some 45 percent of americans said they supported trump's idea to suspend muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. meanwhile, about 70 percent of americans, including a majority of democrats and republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014. clinton focused her response to the orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat islamic state and what she called ""radical jihadist terrorism,"" while warning against demonizing muslim-americans. she also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons. as usual after a major attack, ""terrorism"" jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues. the poll's five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely american voters supported clinton, while 34.8 percent supported trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. on sunday, clinton's support was at 46.6 percent, versus trump's 32.3 percent. the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english with adults living in the continental united states, alaska and hawaii. the political horserace poll included 1,133 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll's accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.58666666666667,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
"trump slams media criticism of refugee, visa reforms - breitbart","president donald trump debunked claims from the media, muslim and critics who claim his new visitor safeguard policy and refugee reform is a blanket “muslim ban. ”[“this is not a muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” trump said in the sunday statement, as and islamist groups decried his new visitor safeguards in airports around the nation, and protested his planned reduction in refugee inflow to 50, 000 per year. “this is not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our country safe. there are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority muslim that are not affected by this order,” trump said. “my policy is similar to what president obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from iraq for six months,” said trump. “the seven countries named in the executive order are the same countries previously identified by the obama administration as sources of terror,” he added. the halt in 2011 was quietly imposed by obama when two legal refugees in bowling green, ky. were discovered to have been jihad attackers in iraq. the two jihadis had slipped through lax vetting procedures when they were invited to take refuge in the united states. trump continued: america is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. america has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. we will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say … we will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. i have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in syria. my first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president i will find ways to help all those who are suffering. the executive order, signed by trump on friday, will suspend visas for 90 days for “immigrants and ” from the islamic countries of syria, somalia, sudan, libya, yemen, iran, and iraq, pending the development of acceptable vetting methods. many countries with large muslim populations, such as saudi arabia, india, and indonesia, will not be affected. the order also cuts the annual inflow of refugees back to 50, 000 per year, roughly level with the annual inflows in obama’s first term. that reduction is strongly opposed by u. s. islamic advocacy groups who favor islamic migration into the united states. on thursday, trump said that his administration would look at creating safe zones in syria as part of an effort to ease the country’s humanitarian crisis. you can follow ben kew on facebook, on twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com,",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.142222222222227,21.37777777777778,0.0,0.0
house republicans mull length of spending bill as vote looms,"washington (reuters) - republicans in the u.s. house of representatives were in discussions on tuesday about how long to fund the federal government in a short-term spending measure expected to come to a vote as early as wednesday. “i feel like we’re going to have a majority... for passing the cr (spending measure) we have this week,” house speaker paul ryan told reporters after a closed-door meeting with fellow house republican members. “we’re having a good conversation with our members about timing and date ... and all the rest,” he added. the conservative house freedom caucus, which has enough members to block legislation, has pressed republican leaders to consider a spending measure that expires on dec. 30, eight days later than the dec. 22 deadline that house and senate republicans have been discussing up to now. ryan said the end date of the measure, known officially as a continuing resolution, or cr, would become known when it reaches the house floor. but house rules committee chairman pete sessions told reporters his panel would consider a continuing resolution that expires on dec. 22. the committee later rescheduled its hearing on the legislation for 3 p.m. (2000 gmt) on wednesday. several other house republicans, however, said members were still debating whether the funding would expire on dec. 22 or on dec. 30, after the dec. 25 christmas holiday. “it’s still being negotiated,” said representative greg walden. a senate republican leadership aide sidestepped a question on what senate leaders thought about the cr date. “if the house makes any changes to their bill, i’m sure they will let everyone know,” the aide said.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.830000000000002,8.0,0.0,0.0
serbian foreign minister rejects u.s. call to choose between russia and the west,"belgrade (reuters) - serbia wants to maintain its delicate balancing act between russia and the west, its foreign minister said on thursday, dismissing u.s. calls for it to pick a side. the largest of the states to emerge from the collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s, orthodox christian and slavic serbia has natural affinity with moscow, but it is keen to join the european union. this month, u.s. deputy assistant secretary for european and eurasian affairs hoyt brian yee told belgrade it cannot sit on two chairs at the same time . his remarks sparked sharp criticism in the serbian capital. foreign minister ivica dacic, who heads the co-ruling socialists, once led by late strongman slobodan milosevic, said belgrade would maintain balance with the west, russia and china. what we do not want is that someone pulls our own chair from under us ... what is important is to see what is in our own best interest, dacic told reuters in an interview. although the eu is serbia s single largest trade partner and investor, russia controls its oil and gas supplies. moscow has also sought to bolster military ties with belgrade with the donation of six mig-29 fighter jets. at serbia s request, moscow blocked independent kosovo from becoming a member of the united nations. the ethnic albanian-dominated kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 following a bloody 1998-1999 war. it has been recognized by 115 countries including the united states and most eu members, but not serbia or russia. dacic likened serbia s opposition to kosovan independence to spain s rejection of catalonia s referendum on secession. if spain can fight for its concept of catalonia then we serbs can fight for our country, he said. serbia, which cherishes kosovo as its historic birthplace, and the government in pristina should seek a win-win solution and an international conference that would prevent future wars for a century, dacic said. earlier this year he suggested autonomy and delimitation for serb areas in kosovo. that would be the only possible, realistic and lasting ... solution of the problem, he said in the interview. there are around 120,000 serbs in kosovo and most of them, mainly in the north, just outside serbia, oppose the pristina authorities.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.006538461538462,8.753846153846155,0.0,0.0
trump budget defunds planned parenthood - breitbart,"washington, d. c. — the trump administration fiscal year 2018 budget set to be released on tuesday factors in the defunding of planned parenthood, assuming the american health care act passes into law. [office of management and budget (omb) director mick mulvaney was asked at a monday press briefing if the new budget defunds abortion provider planned parenthood. he replied, “yes,” but added that it does “because it assumes the american health care act passes and the ahca in its current form, which is the one we assumed — and that’s making a bunch of assumptions, here — that it assumes that passes and that defunds planned parenthood. ” the new budget entitled, “a new foundation for american greatness” will be posted to the omb website at 11:00 a. m. on tuesday morning. mulvaney told reporters at the monday briefing that the budget focuses in on more money for defense, border security, law enforcement, veterans, and school choice. the ahca struggled to pass the house and faces an uphill battle to passage in the senate. asked during the monday briefing about changes to medicaid, mulvaney said, “we assume the affordable health care act that passed out of the house passes. that has some medicaid changes into it. we wrap that into our budget proposals. we go another half a step further and ratchet down some of the growth rates that are assumed in the ahca. ” defunding of planned parenthood was a provision of the ahca that president donald trump used to put pressure on the conservative house freedom caucus to vote for passage of the bill. the director said that the budget balances in 10 years and funds the president’s priorities. mulvaney will deliver the budget to the hill on tuesday and will testify before the house budget committee on wednesday and the senate budget committee on thursday. follow michelle moons on twitter @michellediana",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.350000000000001,15.733333333333334,0.0,0.0
"zika is no longer a global emergency, w.h.o. says - the new york times","the world health organization declared an end to its global health emergency over the spread of the zika virus on friday, prompting dismay from some public health experts confronting the epidemic. an agency advisory committee said it ended the emergency — formally known as a public health emergency of international concern — because zika is now shown to be a dangerous disease, like malaria or yellow fever, and should be viewed as an ongoing threat met as other diseases are, sometimes with w. h. o. help. committee members repeatedly emphasized that they did not consider the zika crisis over. “we are not downgrading the importance of zika,” said dr. peter salama, executive director of the w. h. o. ’s health emergencies program. “we are sending the message that zika is here to stay and the w. h. o. response is here to stay. ” like all diseases, zika is seasonal and may repeatedly return to countries with the aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry it, dr. salama added. individual countries facing serious new zika outbreaks could still declare local emergencies, said dr. david l. heymann, chair of the advisory committee. but other experts worried that the w. h. o. ’s declaration might slow the international response to an epidemic that is still spreading, and lull people at risk into thinking they were safe. dr. anthony s. fauci, director of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases, which is funding efforts to find a zika vaccine, suggested that it was premature to lift the state of emergency since summer is just beginning in the southern hemisphere. “are we going to see a resurgence in brazil, colombia and elsewhere?” he asked. “if they pull back on the emergency, they’d better be able to reinstate it. why not wait a couple of months to see what happens?” his agency would not slow down its vaccine efforts, he said. since the w. h. o. first declared a state of emergency on feb. 1, the zika virus has spread to almost every country in the western hemisphere except canada. thousands of babies suffer deformities caused by the infection, and more are expected. recent outbreaks and related birth defects have also been detected in southeast asia, although scientists believe the zika virus has circulated there for decades. the most severe deformity is microcephaly, a tiny head with a severely underdeveloped brain but fetuses have also been killed by the virus, and infected infants have been born blind, deaf, with clubbed feet and permanent limb rigidity. scientists also fear that many infected babies who appear normal now may suffer from intellectual deficits or mental illnesses later in their lives. the centers for disease control and prevention expressed no opinion about the w. h. o. ’s decision, but noted that it “did not change the urgent need to continue our work. ” the agency also reiterated the warning it issued in january that pregnant women should avoid traveling to areas where the virus was being transmitted. other experts, like dr. fauci, were more critical. the w. h. o. decision is “unwise,” said dr. lawrence o. gostin, director of georgetown university’s o’neill institute for national and global health law. although the virus is not killing or deforming as many babies as originally expected, “the international response has been lethargic,” dr. gostin said. “w. h. o. ’s action to call off the global emergency has provided reason for governments and donors to pull back even more,” he said. even if the outbreak no longer meets the technical definition of an emergency under 2005 international health regulations, there is an important psychological component to declaring an emergency. headlines suggesting the crisis is over may lead people to take fewer precautions against sexual and transmission, experts said. “we are still not out of the woods,” said scott c. weaver, a virologist at the university of texas medical branch in galveston who was among the first to warn that the virus threatened the americas. the disaster in northeast brazil, where more than 2, 000 babies have been born with microcephaly, will probably not be repeated, mr. weaver said. and he “would not be surprised if the disease had run its course in central america and the caribbean. ” but, he added, “i think the worst is yet to come in southern brazil — places like são paulo. and some places in the amazon haven’t seen the virus at all yet. ” when a large portion of a population has been infected with a virus and has recovered, rising “herd immunity” usually ends the transmission of a virus for several years, until enough susceptible victims are born. dr. albert i. ko, a yale epidemiologist who has worked in northeast brazil for years, said he understood the w. h. o. ’s rationale but felt the agency had acted too soon. the full extent of the damage in latin america is unknown, he said, because many infected babies are yet to be born. also, asian governments are just beginning to realize that they face a crisis, he added, and may now take fewer countermeasures. when the w. h. o. declared an emergency in february, it was intended in part to get scientists to explore the connection and to make countries cooperate in fighting the epidemic. at the time, it was unknown whether brazil’s surge in microcephalic babies was caused by the zika virus, which had been discovered in 1947 and was considered a mild disease. later, w. h. o. officials declared themselves satisfied that zika was the main cause of the microcephaly outbreak. in a later meeting, officials decided that the risk was not sufficient to justify canceling the olympic games in rio de janeiro, but was high enough that pregnant women should avoid traveling to the area.",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.191153846153846,5.676923076923078,0.0,0.0
factbox: key republicans in u.s. senate tax bill fight,"washington (reuters) - six more u.s. senators signed on to support a sweeping republican tax bill on friday, leaving only one known republican opponent - bob corker - and virtually assuring the measure would pass despite democratic opposition. a vote was expected later friday. here are the republican senators who have been pivotal to the bill’s fate. corker, a deficit hawk from tennessee, said on friday he could not vote for the senate legislation because of fiscal concerns. in a statement, he said he believed the tax overhaul “could deepen the debt burden on future generations.” corker had stalled momentum on the tax bill on thursday by demanding republicans look for more ways to keep the bill from causing the u.s. deficit to balloon. he said friday he felt it would have been fairly easy to alter the measure in a way that would have been more fiscally sound, but “unfortunately, it is clear that the (republican) caucus is in a different place.” however, corker said he had told president donald trump in a phone call friday that he would take a close look at the final version of the bill, expected to be produced by a house-senate conference, before deciding how to vote on it. the joint committee on taxation estimated on thursday that the republican bill would expand the national debt by $1 trillion over 10 years, far short of assertions by republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. the moderate senator from maine announced friday she will support the tax bill after securing several improvements in the text and getting assurances that other legislation would be advanced to help lower health insurance premiums. collins dislikes a clause in the bill repealing a fee imposed on people who do not comply with obamacare’s “individual mandate” to obtain health insurance. she said she worried that repealing this fee would drive up insurance premium costs, canceling out gains from tax cuts that many constituents might get from the bill. she said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had pledged to help mitigate the effect of the repeal by supporting passage of two other healthcare bills before the end of the year. one would help insurers cover expensive patients; the other would continue obamacare subsidy payments for low-income people for two years. collins also got three amendments included in the tax bill, including one to keep the state and local property tax deduction of up to $10,000 from federal income tax. this would mirror legislation already passed by the house of representatives. the montana republican signed on to support the bill friday after having voiced concerns about its treatment of “main street” businesses. he said he had won more tax relief for non-corporate pass-through businesses, which include partnerships, sole proprietorships and other non-corporate enterprises. the senator from wisconsin endorsed the bill after demanding more for pass-throughs. the bill now features a 23 percent tax deduction for such business owners, up from the original 17.4 percent, said statements from daines and johnson. the arizona conservative announced in a statement on friday he would vote for the bill. he said he had succeeded in eliminating an $85 billion expensing “budget gimmick” and received a firm commitment from senate leaders and the trump administration to work on permanent protections for immigrants who were brought to the united states illegally as children. oklahoma’s lankford came aboard on friday after having questioned whether tax revenues from economic growth would compensate for an expected increase in the national debt. he announced on friday he was voting for the bill. moran had earlier been wary of its impact on the debt. the arizona maverick and former presidential candidate announced on thursday that he would back the tax bill. the senator from alaska will vote for the tax bill, she wrote on twitter on wednesday evening.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.520555555555557,6.2444444444444445,0.1111111111111111,0.0

strange people who shifted to other dimensions,"mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our own? are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some thin, untraceable veil separating us? the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not new, yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the now? are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to see? i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before , and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions real, but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked away, whether intentional or not. in the september, 1956 issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in 1934. according to the report, in the fall of that year a woman by the name of miriam golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her fiancee in chicago. the elevator was crowded, and when miriam made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one. that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at all, but rather an expansive train station. the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered activity, with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air. there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before. the confused miriam made her way to an information booth to ask where she was, but found that the woman working there completely ignored her, as if she weren’t there at all. perplexed, miriam followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street outside, and she emerged out into a mild, sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than fall, in a place that was most certainly not chicago. she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her. at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even there, and miriam approached him wondering what was going on. the boy was able to actually see and respond to her, and looked in her direction, the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this strange, surreal place. as she approached, the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to miriam, smiled slightly and purportedly saying: “i guess they let you off at the wrong stop, too.” the two lost people walked together down the street in confusion, the whole time completely ignored by those around them, and the boy told miriam of what had happened to him. he claimed that he had been playing tennis in lincoln, nebraska, in the united states, and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes. when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train terminal, which had turned out to be the exact same station into which miriam had enigmatically entered from the elevator. the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to water, and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary. to miriam’s astonishment, one of the women was oddly her fiancee’s sister. the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to miriam and her companion. this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the sandbar, which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach. yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the waves, he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration. it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air. miriam closed her eyes in exasperation, disappointment, and exhaustion, and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space. after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in chicago, which seemed to be in the process of closing for the night, suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours. disoriented, miriam looked around for her fiancee but could not find him and decided to head back to his home. when she arrived, her fiancee was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home. bizarrely, the fiancee’s sister, whom miriam had seen on the mysterious sandbar earlier, claimed that she had seen miriam in town and had even called out to her, but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her. where did miriam go during that time? why should she see her fiancee’s sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in town, all while they could not reach across to communicate? were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever understand? it is a mystery. another strange article in the april, 1959 issue of fate magazine tells of the weird experience of a frances e. peterson of keokuk, iowa, who in 1935 was traveling home with her husband and four children from a weekend trip to missouri. on the way they noticed what looked like a quaint, scenic detour in the area of st. patrick and they whimsically took it, driving along the rustic, quiet scenery until they reached the rim of an expansive valley. in addition to the picturesque scenery was the rather odd sight of several women in old-fashioned sun bonnets and long skirts and aprons busily pulling water from a well into simple wooden buckets and carrying them off on wooden poles balanced across their shoulders. there were men here as well, who all had beards and wore similarly old-fashioned clothes such as smocks and large black hats, and who were tending flocks of sheep and goats or collecting firewood. enamored with the quaint, charming scene, they later asked locals what the settlement was, yet were told that no such place had ever existed. convinced that it did indeed exist, peterson and her husband returned to the area several times afterwards, but could find no sign of the valley they had seen or its unusual inhabitants, suggesting that either the family or the place they had visited had been temporarily transported over some little understood thin spot between realities. in another similarly strange road story from 1962, a mr. r. w. balcom and his wife were driving to lake tahoe from their home in live oak, california. the couple stopped at a quaint restaurant nestled away off of highway 50 a few miles from placerville. they had never noticed the restaurant there before in all of their years of traveling along the same route, even though it seemed from its weathered, rustic look to have been there for years, and they decided to stop there for a bite to eat. the food was described as being surprisingly good and the service was cordial and friendly, so they decided that they would visit again. on their return trip from lake tahoe they attempted to seek out the charming little restaurant to eat there again, but when they arrived at the location it was reportedly gone as if it had never been there at all. perplexed, the couple supposedly spent three more weekends traveling through the area in an effort to find the restaurant that they were convinced was there, but never found it again. did balcom and his wife travel to a parallel universe for lunch? no one knows. an intriguing case of a mysterious doorway to another dimension and perhaps even through time itself occurred in 1956, when a treasure hunter by the name of ron quinn ventured with his brother chuck and some friends into the remote and rugged mountains of southeastern arizona looking for mysterious lost spanish treasures and gold mines. the case begins with high strangeness and only gets more bizarre as it goes on. three weeks into their adventure, the treasure hunters set up camp one night, and that evening they were surprised to see two large balls of bluish green light floating about in the darkened, starry sky. the bewildered campers determined that these were not flares of any kind, nor any sort of known aircraft. the weird balls of light hovered about for several minutes before vanishing behind some mountain peaks. the next evening, the same phenomenon was witnessed again. when they mentioned the strange lights to a local cowboy named louie romero, he informed them that the unexplained lights were a recurring phenomenon in the area, and had been seen as far back as 1939. the group would spot the strange lights several more times over the course of their excursion. ron and chuck quinn at one point during their travels, the group passed by what looked like a stone archway, which stood out as something of an anomaly upon the landscape, looking decidedly out of place, yet they didn’t think much of it until later, when they spoke to a native local named john, who claimed that the archway had long been surrounded by strange stories and rumors that anyone who entered the doorway never came out, and that objects thrown in would not emerge from the other side, earning the structure the name “doorway of the gods.” there were also stories of the archway shimmering, and of strange figures lurking around it dressed in old fashioned clothing that did not seem to be ghosts, as they disturbed the gravel where they stepped and cast shadows, yet they would suddenly vanish. there were also tales of camps near the archway that had been mysteriously abandoned and of prospectors who had never returned from the area. john relayed his own tale of strangeness concerning the archway, claiming that one dark and stormy day he had visited it and peered through it to see that, although the scenery was the same, the sky was oddly clear and blue on the other side. when he looked around the edge of the doorway, the clouds were once again dark and thick, hanging menacingly over the scene, and the bizarre sight with its contrasting views frightened him. enthralled with these odd stories, quinn and his group went back through the perilous rocky terrain to find the mysterious archway and investigate it. they managed to locate the strange looking structure once again, and upon closer inspection it proved to be surrounded with an unusually large deposit of geodes, some of which were broken open with their interiors glittering in the sun. the archway itself was measured as being around 7 feet high and 5 feet wide, with columns of andesite 15 inches diameter and it stood beside a steep, rocky slope. after checking it out, the team went to work testing out the weird stories by throwing various rocks through the opening, but the rocks all mundanely fell to the ground on the other side and there was no sign of anything remotely mysterious whatsoever. increasingly skeptical, some of the members of the team boldly put their arms through without incident, although no one was willing to try stepping all the way through. after around an hour of this, they departed no closer to understanding the supposed mystery of this location. however, a weird series of events would unfold in the coming days that would make them think that something strange was going on. chuck quinn with some of the geodes from the site one day as they were checking out the portal yet again and collect some of the geodes, roy and another member of the team, walt, noticed that the stone portal seemed to be shimmering as if simmering in intense heat, even though it was a cold january day. the odd shimmering allegedly lasted a few minutes, during which time both men claimed that they could feel a building pressure within their ears, before the shimmering and the weird physical sensation slowly ebbed away. the inexplicable event spooked both of them, especially roy, who vowed never to go anywhere near the archway again. on another occasion, the group came across another group of three treasure hunters who claimed that they had also camped out near the mysterious stone portal. the group claimed that that evening their camp had been hit by what sounded like rain hitting their tents, even though it was a clear night. looking out of their tents, they were met with the sight of small, reddish brown pebbles around the size of a pea falling in great numbers from above. the pebbles were found to be warm to the touch and there was no explanation for where they came from. they had seemed to be made of some king of iron ore. all of these escalating odd occurrences would point to something decidedly strange going on at the archway, but the most bizarre incident would happen years after the expedition was over. four years after that fateful treasure hunt, on october 14, 1973, chuck quinn was compelled to make a personal trip to the site of the stone portal that had eluded their understanding, and arrived at the canyon that led up to the slopes that would lead up to the site. chuck went about climbing up the steep, rocky slopes towards the archway, stopping for a breather about halfway up the harrowing climb. it was here as he looked out west over the majestic scenery all around him that he noticed that there was a canyon that should not have been there. baffled, he made his way back down the slope to enter from the east, and it was here that he realized that in fact he was in the same canyon he had been in before, only he had somehow been transported 250 yards down the canyon he had hiked along, and to another slope that was facing south rather than west. the strange event convinced him that indeed there was something strange going on here, and hastily left the scene. was this some sort of doorway to another dimension or merely tall tales? one wonders if perhaps some of the more bizarre vanishings and reappearances of people also have some form of interdimensional shift at their core. at about 7:00 p.m. on august 15, 1960, 6-year-old kathy cramer, of wood’s hole, massachusetts simply vanished from her room in her home. her parents had checked on her when she was sleeping one minute, and the next she was gone without a trace. when authorities arrived the house was searched top to bottom, and no signs of forced entry or a struggle could be found. cathy’s bed seemed to be in a peaceful state, with no sign of being disturbed in any kind of confrontation. the window to the room was also closed and showed no signs of anyone coming in or going out that way. an intensive search was immediately launched, composed of hundreds of people including police, firemen, volunteers, airmen from nearby otis air force base, and bloodhounds, as well as the coast guard scouring the nearby coast, yet absolutely no evidence of the missing girl could be found anywhere. she had simply vanished off the face of the earth. then later, at 3am on that same evening, cathy’s very worried parents went into to her room to be startled by the sight of their missing daughter sleeping peacefully in her bed as if she had never been gone. when she was asked about where she had been, the girl gave the cryptic response of “i’m not telling.” what in the world happened to this little girl? how could a 6-year-old disappear from her bed, elude an intensive search by various professionals, and then reappear fast asleep exactly where she had vanished? is this also perhaps an example of someone crossing through the veil between realities to pass temporarily into some parallel world or dimension? the only person who knows the answer to that is cathy cramer herself, and she’s not telling. so are any of these accounts somehow anchored in any way to reality as we know it? are these the realm of the lost mind untethered, spinning fantastical tales either out of hallucination, insanity, or an irrational attempt to make sense of distorted perceptions? can this all simply be explained away somehow or is there a genuine phenomenon hinting at forces of the universe we have yet to comprehend buried within these disparate accounts? are we perhaps just one of many alternate realities stacked upon one another and which between slips, shifting and travel are possible? the answers are elusive, and we may continue to pour over and debate them forever. however as long as there is the probability and possibility of worlds beyond our own there will always be those who look out into our universe, or perhaps inward, to seek to try to grasp just what this all might mean. in the meantime, cases like this will remain a tantalizing peek into what just may be out there beyond our grasp to conceive of

melania trump's rnc speech produces so-so tv audience,"(reuters) - melania trump’s big night at the republican national convention failed to draw bumper television audiences despite networks boosting their coverage of the gathering and husband donald trump promising a “showbiz” feel to the week. according to nielsen ratings data on tuesday from seven leading broadcast and cable networks, an estimated 23 million people watched monday evening’s highlight during the 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. hour when melania trump, the wife of republican white house contender donald trump, delivered her speech. the focus of the convention initially shifted on tuesday from the formal anointing of trump to accusations that sections of melania trump’s speech were strikingly similar to an address by michelle obama at the democratic convention in 2008. the early viewing figures were similar to those for the first night of the republican convention in 2012, which attracted an audience of 22.3 million, according to nielsen. u.s. television networks have boosted coverage of the republican convention this year after trump, a new york businessman, drew huge audiences during the 2016 presidential debates during the state nominating contests. trump, the former star of “the apprentice” tv show, has promised to throw out traditional political convention scripts and “put some showbiz” into the mix. media analysts predicted that viewership for trump’s acceptance speech this week for the republican presidential nomination could surpass the record 38 million who watched barack obama address the democratic convention in 2008. in 2012, the democratic convention generally drew more nightly tv viewers than the republican gathering, when mitt romney was running for the white house. on monday, the fox news cable channel, as expected, got the most viewers for its convention coverage, averaging 6.4 million in the 10 p.m. hour. among the mainstream networks, nbc led with 3.9 million. however, the biggest single program audience of monday night was for reality show “the bachelorette,” which was seen by some 6.6 million on abc. about 3 million people turned off when abc switched to the convention.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.180000000000003,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
"republican tax bill stumbles on deficit 'trigger,' new options weighed","washington (reuters) - a republican tax bill in the u.s. senate stalled on a procedural problem late on thursday, forcing lawmakers to weigh new options to an amendment sought by a leading fiscal hawk to address a projected large expansion of the federal deficit under the measure, senators said. senator bob corker had wanted to add a provision to the bill that would trigger automatic tax increases in years ahead if the tax cuts in the bill failed to boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion. but the senate parliamentarian barred corker’s “trigger” proposal. “we just got the realization from the parliamentarian that that’s probably not going to work,” said republican senator david perdue. in response, republicans were considering building future tax increases into their bill. “it’s not a threshold anymore. it’s just a tax increase. ... the only thing that’s come off the table is the trigger concept,” perdue said.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.55,12.0,0.0,0.0

breaking: leftist democrat mayor ordered baltimore police to stand down [video],"a source involved in the enforcement efforts confirmed there was a direct order from the mayor to her police chief, as riots broke out on monday night to stand down.despite a firm denial by baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake, a senior law enforcement source charges that she gave an order for police to stand down as riots broke out monday night, raising more questions about whether some of the violence and looting could have been prevented.the source, who is involved in the enforcement efforts, confirmed to fox news there was a direct order from the mayor to her police chief monday night, effectively tying the hands of officers as they were pelted with rocks and bottles.asked directly if the mayor was the one who gave that order, the source said: you are god damn right it was. the claim follows criticism of the mayor for, over the weekend, saying they were giving space to those who wished to destroy. by tuesday night, despite the chaos a day earlier, baltimore police along with the national guard and other law enforcement contingents seemed to be restoring order in the city, which was under a curfew overnight.rawlings-blake has defended her handling of the unrest, which grew out of protests over the death of freddie gray while in police custody.the mayor, in an interview with fox news bill hemmer on tuesday, denied any order was issued to hold back on monday. you have to understand, it is not holding back. it is responding appropriately, she said, saying there was no stand-down directive.she said her critics have a right to their opinion.maryland gov. larry hogan on monday suggested the mayor also waited too long to request a state of emergency.that followed criticism over her remarks over the weekend, when she said it s important to give protesters the opportunity to exercise their right to free speech.she seemed to take that notion a step further: it s a very delicate balancing act, because, while we tried to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well. as her destroy remarks faced a buzzsaw of criticism amid the riots monday, the mayor initially tried to deny she said them. i never said nor would i ever say that we are giving people space to destroy our city, so my words should not be twisted, the mayor said monday.in a press conference, she accused critics of a blatant mischaracterization. but her office eventually released a written statement acknowledging she said those words while attempting to explain them.via: fox news",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.3,15.30909090909091,0.0,0.0
az pastor: ‘perfect christians’ would bathe in ‘f*ggot’ blood while singing psalms (video),"pastor steven anderson of faithful word baptist church in tempe, arizona, is a bigot in the truest sense of the word though you ll never hear him admit it. anderson s hatred of the lgbt community, muslims, jews, women, and even president obama, is so deeply rooted that he genuinely believes that he is simply following the bible (you know, if you cut out all that stuff about loving thy neighbor).recently, anderson ignited international outrage when he called the orlando massacre good news because lots of gay people died. in december 2014, he said that we could cure aids if we exterminated all the homos. this may seem like frightening rhetoric, but it pales in comparison to what he said sunday night.anderson told his congregation that they the hateful, anti-gay hate group have more love in our little finger than that f*ggoty church down the street that supports the lgbt community has in their whole body. anderson says that he is, indeed, required to love his neighbor but his homosexual neighbor should be dead. shortly before those remarks, anderson said something truly horrifying about what perfect christians should be doing. anderson says that while most sinners can find god, the lgbt community is hopeless because it is impossible for them to love or accept jesus. here s the thing about those filthy reprobates, anderson told his congregation. they re not going to turn from their wickedness because god has darkened their heart and blinded their eyes. anderson continued, explaining that if god has done such things, you can t believe. referencing psalm 58:10, which states that the righteous (anderson s flock in this case) will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked (the lgbt community).the pastor says that he doesn t understand why his praise of the orlando shooter made people angry because he, nor the other pastors who have made headlines for their horrific orlando remarks, didn t fly to florida and bathe their feet in the blood of the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in our country s history. i don t think pastor romero hopped on a plane to orlando so he could just go wash his feet in the blood of the wicked and praise god for their death, anderson quipped as his congregation laughed at the super-funny awesome joke. but if he would have, it would have been ok. more laughter. then he described his perfect world. if we were in a perfect world, if we were perfect christians, if we were doing everything that god wanted us to do, anderson said, then they would sing not only hymns but the psalms. and what better way to sing them but while having a nice, reprobate blood foot bath: why would god want us to sing about washing our feet in the blood of the wicked in the new testament? can someone explain that to me? because it s valid today. because it still stands. because god is still the same god. anderson said that other christians the fake ones who accept others for who they are accuse him of saying that if a homo loves jesus he still won t be saved. banging his head against a tree prop, the pastor angrily explained that he didn t ever say that: argh, i never said that. i m saying they don t believe in jesus. anybody who believes in jesus will be saved. i m saying they don t believe in jesus. but i met one who says he loves jesus. they re lying. get real folks. and yet they still come at you. anderson s sermon then dissolved into a mini-rant about how normal people don t want to do the stuff that gay people do (like mowing the lawn, shopping, riding a bicycle, playing chess, watching television ). who here struggles really hard to not be a homo, anderson said with his hand raised. he was the only one who raised his hand. i mean it s really hard. other men are just so appealing and it s a struggle no, you re like gross, it s disgusting. look, the only way that a dude would lust after another dude is if god gave him over unto vile affections to do those things. watch anderson s latest horrific rant below:featured image via screengrab",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.633846153846157,8.276923076923078,0.0,0.0
trump’s $45 million loan is the latest way he’s fleecing his campaign for money,"donald trump s campaign might be close to broke, and he might be doing highly illegal things to try and keep it afloat, but evidence has also been mounting that he s using this election as a means of profit. the $45 million worth of debt the campaign has is apparently personal loans he made, and he can convert them to donations, effectively wiping out the campaign s debt.he d have to file paperwork with the fec, though, and so far, that hasn t happened. nbc wasn t able to get much out of his campaign about this, with spokesperson hope hicks saying they re going to file it with the next scheduled fec report. she had originally said that they were going to file it last week.until that paperwork is filed, though, this is another way for him to line his pockets with pieces of silver. while that loan is still a loan, he can use new campaign donations to reimburse himself. the law gives him until august to do this, so he can milk this for all it s worth and nobody can do a thing about it.trumplestiltskin is such an upstanding candidate.gop donors are squirrelly about this because they want assurances that their money isn t going into trump s personal coffers. the problem is, until he files that paperwork, there can t be any assurances, and his royal crookedness will find other ways of funneling those donations to his not-inconsiderable bank accounts anyway.earlier this week, usa today, which seems to have made it their mission to scrutinize every single thing trump does, reported that just two percent of the gop donors that supported mitt romney four years ago have contributed to trump in any way. some blame his late start in courting gop donors, but the truth is, many of them are just too hesitant to give money to him.all he has to do is file a signed statement and reflect the change in accounting on his next filing. it s not like it s that hard. trump s campaign said that this was a done deal and yet, it isn t. why wouldn t they just tell the truth from the get-go, and say that they ll do it with the next monthly filing, instead of a special statement? the answer s pretty clear, given what trump has been doing with his businesses and his campaign finances. he s in it for the profit, and he will profit in any way he can.featured image by drew angerer/getty images",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.11764705882352941,5.884285714285717,5.6000000000000005,0.0,0.0

"trump is right again: ‘no, the constitution does not bar religious tests in immigration law’","andrew c. mccarthy, former assistant united states attorney for the southern district of new york, writes in national review that donald trump s proposed temporary ban on muslim immigration is not unconstitutional. mccarthy notes that properly vetting would-be immigrants religious beliefs is not only legal it would be wise and prudent. of all the ignorant pronouncements in the 2016 presidential campaign, the dumbest may be that the constitution forbids a religious test in the vetting of immigrants. monotonously repeated in political speeches and talking-head blather, this claim is heedless of the islamic doctrinal roots on which foreign-born islamists and the jihadists they breed base their anti-americanism. it is also dead wrong.the clause said to be the source of this drivel is found in article vi. as you ll no doubt be shocked to learn, it has utterly nothing to do with immigration. the clause states, no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states (emphasis added). on its face, the provision is not only inapplicable to immigrants at large, let alone aliens who would like to be immigrants; it does not even apply to the general public. it is strictly limited to public officials specifically to their fitness to serve in government positions.this is equally clear from the clause s context. right before the no religious test directive, article vi decrees that elected and appointed officials shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this constitution[.] an oath of office customarily requires the official to solemnly swear that he or she will support and defend the constitution, so help me god. (see, e.g., the oath prescribed by federal law.) the framers tacked on the no religious test clause to clarify that the mandate of a solemn oath before taking office did not mean fidelity to a particular religious creed was required. the same principle informs the first amendment s prohibition on the establishment of a state religion.this is as it should be. the constitution prescribes very few qualifications for even the highest offices because its purpose is to promote liberty, which vitally includes the freedom to elect whomever we choose, to vote our own private consciences. the principal check on public officials is the ballot box, not the law s minimalist requirements.as voters, we have the right to weigh a candidate s religious beliefs as a significant part of the total package. we have done so from the republic s founding and to this day, virtually all candidates take pains to wear their faith, however nominal, on their sleeves. when the loathsome jeremiah wright fleetingly became an issue in the 2008 campaign, barack obama did not thunder, under the constitution, you must not inquire into my religious beliefs! he threw the rev under the bus. when it comes to choosing those who will represent us, we do not limit ourselves by intrusive laws, but we reserve the right to bring to bear any consideration, including religion, that we deem relevant.read more: national review",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.140000000000004,14.0,0.0,0.0
rupert murdoch calls special meeting as fox news ratings falter,"fox news executive chairman rupert murdoch will host a meeting wednesday amid internal turmoil at the network and threats to its ratings dominance from msnbc. [according to deadline, murdoch is set to host two meetings at the network’s new studio, studio f, where he will discuss both the company’s plans for a new newsroom and its overall direction and future. the meetings will reportedly be held in two shifts to accommodate all staff. the meetings come as the network has been rocked by a series of sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits in recent months, culminating in last month’s departure of star anchor and cable news ratings king bill o’reilly. following o’reilly’s departure, the network’s primetime schedule underwent perhaps its most significant reshuffling in years, with tucker carlson taking over o’reilly’s 8 p. m. time slot and the panel show the five moving to 9 p. m. but the network faces an early test of its new lineup from msnbc, which has benefitted greatly from star anchor rachel maddow and its lineup’s breathless coverage of the trump administration. last week, msnbc won the key demo ( ) during weeknights for the first time in seven years, with the rachel maddow show, the last word with lawrence o’donnell and the 11th hour with brian williams all finishing first in their respective time slots, according to adweek. fox news finished first in total viewership, with an average 2. 6 million viewers, but msnbc was right on its heels with 2. 4 million. cnn lagged far behind with 1. 3 million. it was the 19th straight week that fox news led all competitors in total viewers. but the network’s hold on total viewership could soon be in jeopardy as well. on monday, msnbc came within two thousand viewers of surpassing fox news in that category, and fox slipped to third in the news demo with 499, 000 viewers to cnn’s 608, 000 and msnbc’s 662, 000. murdoch’s wednesdays meetings are reportedly meant to “rally the troops” in the face of the challenges. meanwhile, the network’s former talent is moving on. on monday, bill o’reilly announced he would be a guest on radio host and the blaze founder glenn beck’s program on fridays. update: fox news was the cable network in total day viewership for the 19th consecutive week, according to nielsen data. “in primetime, fnc also ranked #1 in all of basic cable with p2+ including nba tnt, with 2. 3 million viewers,” the network noted in a tuesday email to reporters. follow daniel nussbaum on twitter: @dznussbaum",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.190000000000001,4.0,0.0,0.0

dear america: we tried to warn you,"we tried to warn you.from the summer of 2016 onward, democrats tried to warn the american public that russia found a useful idiot in donald trump. he was their puppet, their strongman, their way into the american political scene. no one wanted to believe it.when the dnc and dscc (along with various lawmakers including nancy pelosi) were hacked, we said it was russia. the intelligence agencies agreed. no one wanted to believe it, and the mainstream media brushed it aside.when the podesta emails were hacked and dumped onto the internet for all to read, it was traced back to russian thugs. no one wanted to believe it. they said wikileaks and their leader, julian assange, were doing their due diligence for a more transparent government.when hillary clinton, at the last presidential debate, told 66 million viewers that the russian federation was working tooth and nail to help donald trump, we brushed it off, and accused the democrats of being sore losers, conspiracy riddled, and scared of losing an election (which we did).watch clinton hit it home. if only we listened:hillary dropped this exact same info about russia in front of 66 million viewers in october. but i guess no one listened because emails pic.twitter.com/hce7oqfknv ess (@scottyliterati) december 10, 2016now, the cia agrees russia played a major role in helping donald trump win the presidency. they meddled in our sacred, democratic elections to help a would-be, two-bit dictator wannabe rise to power.a report found:as the summer turned to fall, russian hackers turned almost all their attention to the democrats. virtually all the emails they released publically were potentially damaging to clinton and the democrats, the official told reuters. that was a major clue to their intent, the official said. if all they wanted to do was discredit our political system, why publicize the failings of just one party, especially when they have a target like trump? trump has nominated a secretary of state candidate, rex tillerman, who is a friend to russia and vladimir putin. this is not a coincidence, nor is it a surprise. he has nominated a would-be national security advisor, michael flynn, an ally to russia and spreader of fake news. this also is not a coincidence. this is the reality of the united states, post-obama.no, this was not some 400 pound guy in his parent s basement, as trump would suggest. this is a world power that has their hands in several world crises syria, ukraine and so forth.so while republicans and indeed left-wing defectors from the democratic party hyper focused on the clinton/podesta emails, trump was on the cusp of a victory thanks in part to russian hackings which may even extend to voter hackings in november.the russians may or may not have physically intervened on november 8th to help donald trump win. however, it has now been proven by 17 security agencies, both private and governmental that russia played a key role in souring the public s perception about clinton and the democrats.it wasn t just because of hackings. the kremlin paid and trained trolls to flood the internet with fake news and multiple twitter/facebook accounts to create a world of hate for hillary clinton, a world of praise for donald trump.luckily, republicans like john mccain and lindsey graham are starting to see the big picture, but its not enough. they, along with their conservative colleagues and liberal adversaries, were a-ok with smearing clinton with russian propagated lies if it meant having an r in the white house.when it comes to donald trump and russia, we democrats hate to say it, but, we told you so. american democracy has been sold to the highest bidder, and russia paid the highest price.featured image via justin sullivan/getty images",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.25,3.997142857142858,2.8000000000000003,0.0,0.0
trump's concession on wall funding removes obstacle from spending talks,"washington (reuters) - the threat of a u.s. government shutdown this weekend appeared to recede on tuesday after president donald trump backed away from a demand that congress include funding for his planned border wall with mexico in a spending bill. even if the fight over wall funding is over, republicans and democrats still have difficult issues to resolve as they face a friday night deadline when existing money expires for many federal agencies. there was growing sentiment among lawmakers that they would need to pass a short-term extension of current spending, possibly of one week’s duration, in order to finish negotiating longer-term legislation for funding the government through the end of september. “yeah, it looks like it,” said republican senator lisa murkowski, an appropriations committee member, when asked about the likelihood of a short-term extension. but on tuesday night, some leading republicans and democrats in the house and senate expressed optimism that congress could pass the longer-term bill and avoid having to rely on another temporary extension of last year’s funding levels. “we’re really close,” said republican representative mario diaz-balart, a senior member of the house appropriations committee. he added that leadership would make the final decision on which course congress takes this week. trump removed a crucial sticking point when he said on monday he may wait until republicans begin drafting the budget blueprint for the fiscal year that starts on oct. 1 to seek wall funding. the president’s fellow republicans control both chambers of congress, but the current spending bill will need 60 votes to clear the 100-member senate, where republicans hold only 52 seats. democratic leaders had said they would not support a bill that included funds for the wall. the border wall was one of trump’s signature election pledges last year, with the republican touting it as best way to stop illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the country. if no spending measure covering april 29 to sept. 30 is in place before 12:01 a.m. (0401 gmt) on saturday, government funds will halt and hundreds of thousands of the country’s several million federal employees will be temporarily laid off. trump had run the risk of being blamed by democrats for a shutdown, which would start on his 100th day in office. representative steny hoyer, the second most powerful democrat in the house, said he would advise colleagues to support a short-term funding proposal only if a longer-term fix was imminent. short-term funding measures, known as continuing resolutions and covering periods of days or weeks, have been used to avert shutdowns in the past. but in 2013, conservative republicans forced a 17-day shutdown in a failed attempt to repeal then-president barack obama’s healthcare law, the affordable care act. senate democratic leader chuck schumer welcomed trump’s monday night comments and noted there were republican opponents of the wall too. “it’s really good news that the president seems to be taking the wall off the table,” schumer said on the senate floor on tuesday. “it would remove the prospect of a needless fight over a poison pill proposal that members of both parties don’t support.” late on tuesday, however, white house budget director mick mulvaney told cnn that trump would not agree to other concessions that democrats had sought - cost-sharing healthcare subsidies for 6 million americans. the subsidies are part of the affordable care act health insurance law, commonly called obamacare. mulvaney said the white house had offered democrats to include the obamacare subsidies in exchange for funding the wall. “but they said no to that and we agreed to put that off for another day,” he said. by dropping his call for immediate funding for the wall, trump may clear a path to a spending bill. but he will lose an opportunity to display serious progress on accomplishing his agenda since taking office on jan. 20. there is also no guarantee that congress will want to fund the wall later on, given skepticism running through the republican party. republican senator jeff flake, who represents the border state of arizona, told reporters on tuesday there was a need for a wall in some border locations and alternative deterrents in others. “a lot of us have been pushing for additional border security funding for a while, but a solitary 2,000-mile wall has never been a must-have for anybody in a border state,” he said. trump said he had not changed his stance, tweeting on tuesday: “it will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.” trump has said mexico will eventually repay the united states for wall construction, but the mexican government has been adamant it will not do so, and trump has not laid out plans to compel repayment. internal department of homeland security estimates have put the cost at $21.6 billion. republican senator roger wicker said there was a “substantial figure” in the spending bill dedicated to border security. such spending, not explicitly for a wall, would likely be acceptable to both parties.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,12.0,0.0,0.0
barack obama says memory of hiroshima 'must never fade',"barack obama called on the world to choose a future where hiroshima was considered “the start of our own moral awakening”, as he became the first sitting us president to visit the japanese city, 71 years after its bombing ushered in the nuclear age he vowed to bring to an end. in a scene many survivors of the us bombing believed they would never live to see, obama laid a floral wreath at a memorial to the dead of the world’s first atomic bombing, pausing in a moment of contemplation, his head slightly bowed. he then paid tribute to the people of hiroshima, calling on humanity to learn the lessons of the past to make war less likely. “on a bright, cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed,” he said, adding that humankind had shown that day it had the means to destroy itself. “why did we come to this place, to hiroshima? we come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in the not so distant past. we come to mourn the dead,” he said. “their souls speak to us, they ask us to look inward, take stock of who we are.” in a touching moment, obama embraced shigeaki mori, a 79-year-old survivor who appeared overcome with emotion. “the president gestured as if he was going to give me a hug, so we hugged,” said mori, who spent decades tracing the families of 12 american pows who died in the attack and ensured their deaths were officially recognised. obama also chatted to sunao tsuboi, the 91-year-old head of a survivors group, who thanked the president for his visit, but reminded him of his responsibility to act on his desire, first made in prague in 2009, to bring about a world without nuclear weapons. obama urged the world to “choose a future when hiroshima and nagasaki are not considered the dawn of atomic warfare but as the start of our own moral awakening.” he said: “technological progress without equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us. the scientific revolution that led to the splitting of the atom requires a moral revolution as well. “this is why we come to this place, we stand here, in the middle of this city and force ourselves to imagine the moment the bomb fell. “we force ourselves to feel the dread of children confused by what they see. we listen to a silent cry. “some day, the voices will no longer be with us to bear witness, but the memory must never fade. that memory fuels our imagination. it allows us to change.” his address included mention of the tens of thousands of koreans – many of them forced labourers – who died in the attack, as well as the american dead. in the distance stood the burned-out shell of the atomic bomb dome – a peace memorial that is the most potent physical symbol of hiroshima’s tragic past and its recovery from the ashes of war. as expected, obama did not offer an apology for the decision by his predecessor, harry truman, to unleash an atomic bomb over the city. the attack at the end of the second world war on 6 august 1945 killed an estimated 80,000 people soon after the blast. by the end of the year, the death toll had reached 140,000. obama and tsuboi laughed at one point, the president smiling broadly. but mostly he listened, holding the elderly man’s hand in his own, an interpreter standing nearby. tsuboi stamped his cane emphatically while speaking. obama was accompanied by the japanese prime minister, shinzō abe, whose presence, obama said ahead of the visit, would “highlight the extraordinary alliance” the us had created during the seven decades since the end of the war. after looking at some of the exhibits in the peace museum, obama wrote in the visitors’ book: “we have known the agony of war. let us now find the courage, together, to spread peace, and pursue a world without nuclear weapons” – a goal he conceded he may not see in his lifetime. abe described obama’s visit as “courageous”, saying: “an american president has come into contact with the reality of an atomic bombing and renewed his resolve toward realising a world without nuclear weapons. “i sincerely welcome this historic visit, which has long been awaited by not only the people of hiroshima, but by all japanese people.” kaneko izumi, a hiroshima resident who was among the hundreds of people who filled the peace park in the evening to pay their respects to the victims, said obama’s speech had offered hope to ageing survivors “who have been waiting most of their lives for an american president to come here”. not all residents were satisfied with the president’s speech, however. “i’m afraid i did not hear anything concrete about how he plans to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons,” said miki tsukishita, who was five years old when the bomb was dropped. “just cheering his visit is not enough. he is a serving us president ... i wish he had been more specific.” obama had long held the desire to go to hiroshima, despite the potential for the visit to cause controversy in the us. while many japanese consider the attack a war crime – yet recognise the part their country’s militarist leaders played in bringing it about – the consensus in the us is that the attack hastened the end of the pacific war, saving many more american and japanese lives. japan surrendered on 15 august, less than a week after the us dropped a second atomic bomb, on the western port city of nagasaki, killing more than 70,000 people. obama said during a visit to japan in late 2009 that he would be honoured to go to hiroshima and nagasaki. “i certainly would be honoured – it would be meaningful for me to visit those two cities in the future,” he said. before friday, the only western leader to have visited hiroshima while in office was kevin rudd, who laid a wreath at the peace park cenotaph in 2008 when he was australian prime minister. jimmy carter visited the atomic bomb memorial in hiroshima in 1984, after he had left office, but no sitting us president has ever visited the city. the highest-ranking us official to visit the site was nancy pelosi in 2008 when she was house speaker. the ambassador, caroline kennedy, attended the 70th anniversary commemorations last year. the white house reportedly decided to proceed with the visit after the largely positive reaction to john kerry’s tribute to the victims of the hiroshima bombing on the sidelines of the g7 foreign ministers’ meeting last month. ahead of friday’s visit, obama told us marines and members of the japanese military at the iwakuni base in western japan how it was “a testament to how even the most painful divides can be bridged. how two nations can become not just partners but the best of friends”. his trip, he said, was an “opportunity to honour the memory of all who were lost in world war two” but also had a message for today. “i do think that part of the reason i’m going is because i want to once again underscore the very real risks that are out there and the sense of urgency that we all should have,” obama said. “so it’s not only a reminder of the terrible toll of world war two and the death of innocents across continents, but it’s also to remind ourselves that the job is not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace, and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future.” while polls showed most japanese welcomed obama’s gesture, other countries in the region warned against allowing the visit to reinforce a one-dimensional view of japan’s role in the second world war. the chinese foreign ministry said japan should not forget the “grave suffering” it inflicted on its neighbours during the war. “we hope japan can take a responsible attitude toward its own people and the international community, and earnestly take history as a mirror to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy of the war,” ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told reporters. the state-run china daily went much further, claiming the “atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were of japan’s own making”. in an editorial on the eve of the visit, the paper accused japan of “trying to portray japan as the victim of world war two rather than one of its major perpetrators”. the bombing of both hiroshima and nagasaki was justified, the china daily said, as “a bid to bring an early end to the war and prevent protracted warfare from claiming even more lives”. it added: “it was the war of aggression the japanese militarist government launched against its neighbours and its refusal to accept its failure that had led to us dropping the atomic bombs.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.520000000000003,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0
egyptian court hands fresh life sentence to muslim brotherhood leader,"cairo (reuters) - an egyptian court sentenced top muslim brotherhood leader mohamed badie to another life term in prison on thursday in the latest example of a crackdown against islamists since the army overthrew president mohamed mursi. the sentence relates to violence that broke out in 2013 after the army toppled mursi in the wake of mass demonstrations against him. general abdel fattah al-sisi led the military at that time and was elected president the following year. authorities outlawed the brotherhood after mursi was ousted and arrested thousands of its supporters. they also dissolved its freedom and justice party, which mursi led. mass life and death sentences have been common since then in what rights groups call an unprecedented crackdown. fifteen others were sentenced to life in prison in the same case on thursday while 77 were given 15-year sentences with hard labor. only 38 of those sentenced on thursday were present at court while the rest were sentenced in absentia. the judgment can be appealed in a higher court within the next 60 days. those sentenced were charged with inciting terrorism, leading an outlawed group, raiding and vandalizing government facilities among other crimes related to clashes in beni suef, south of egypt in august 2013. the clashes took place the same day security forces dispersed two islamist sit-ins in central cairo and killed hundreds of mursi s supporters. those sentenced on thursday included former members of parliament and members of the freedom and justice party. badie was sentenced to life in jail in 2014 after being convicted of murder and inciting violence during clashes that took place during the same period.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,12.0,0.0,0.0
"trump, now president, pledges to put 'america first' in nationalist speech","washington (reuters) - donald trump took power as the 45th president of the united states on friday and pledged to end what he called an “american carnage” of rusted factories and crime in an inaugural address that was a populist and nationalist rallying cry. striking a defiant tone, trump said american workers have been devastated by the outsourcing of jobs abroad. “from this day forward it’s going to be only america first,” the republican told thousands of people gathered on the national mall to see him take over from democrat barack obama. with obama and three other former presidents sitting nearby, trump accused previous u.s. administrations of enriching washington at the expense of struggling american families. underscoring the deep divisions in the country, protests against trump turned ugly in downtown washington. black-clad activists smashed store windows, blocked traffic and fought with police in riot gear who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. police said more than 200 people were arrested. aerial pictures of the crowds of trump supporters on the mall showed a much smaller turnout at midday on friday than that in comparable photos from obama’s first inauguration in 2009. estimates of friday’s crowd size were not immediately available from police. the inaugural address was vintage trump, with plenty of material gleaned from dozens of campaign rallies he staged last year on the road to victory on nov. 8 over democrat hillary clinton, who attended the ceremony with her husband, former president bill clinton. trump said the united states has enriched foreign industry at the expense of american companies, subsidized the armies of other countries while letting the u.s. military become depleted, and spent trillions abroad while allowing infrastructure at home to crumble. “the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world,” he said. trump accused the washington establishment of protecting itself but abandoning regular citizens who have suffered from poverty and crime. “this american carnage stops right here and stops right now,” he said. “every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit american workers and american families,” he said. trump, 70, takes over a country divided after a savage election campaign. the grim vision of america he often paints is belied by statistics showing low levels of unemployment and crime nationally, although trump won many votes in parts of the nation where manufacturing industry has been badly hit. while trump positioned himself as a champion of working americans, the tax policy center non-partisan think tank estimates that his tax proposals would not only add $7.2 trillion in u.s. government debt over the first 10 years, but are skewed to help the wealthiest americans. hours after taking the oath of office, trump, who repeatedly promised to repeal obama’s signature health-care law, signed his first executive order, directing u.s. agencies to delay, waive or grant exemptions from any provisions of the affordable care act deemed burdensome for states or individuals. republicans in congress hope to repeal the health care law, also known as obamacare, and replace it. sitting behind the presidential resolute desk, trump signed the order in a hastily arranged ceremony. in the oval office, which obama vacated friday morning, gold drapes had already been hung in place of crimson ones. trump’s election was greeted with concern by many countries around the world, in part because of the potential for an isolationist foreign policy. in an interview after trump was sworn in, german vice chancellor sigmar gabriel said, “what we heard today were high nationalistic tones.” “i think we have to prepare for a rough ride,” gabriel told public broadcaster zdf, adding that europe should stand together to defend its interests. mexican president enrique pena nieto congratulated trump on his inauguration, but cautioned that the sovereignty, national interest and protection of mexicans would be paramount. mexicans have been angered by trump’s pledge to build a wall along the southern u.s. border to keep out illegal immigrants, and to make mexico pay for it. trump has also frequently criticized u.s. companies that have manufacturing operations in mexico. u.s. stocks closed higher on friday in a modest advance, marking the first time in more than 50 years that a new commander-in-chief has been welcomed by a rising equity market on his first day in office. pope francis urged trump to be guided by ethical values, saying he must take care of the poor and the outcast. in moscow, russians hoping trump will usher in a new era of detente celebrated his inauguration. russian nationalists held an all-night party at what used to be the main soviet-era post office in moscow. in the city of zlatoust, craftsmen released a limited series of silver and gold commemorative coins, engraved with “in trump we trust.” trump signaled the possibility of a more aggressive approach to islamic state militants. “we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth,” he said. the u.s. senate overwhelmingly voted on friday to confirm retired general james mattis as defense secretary and retired general john kelly as homeland security secretary, making them the first trump cabinet nominees to be approved. new vice president mike pence swore both in friday night. after repeating the 35-word oath of office in the ceremony, trump stretched his arms wide and hugged his wife, melania, and other members of his family. ceremonial cannon blasts fired. the trumps rode in a heavily armored limousine to lead an inaugural parade to the white house. the couple and their 10-year-old-son, barron, hopped out of the limo and walked part of the parade route, waving to cheering well wishers. later, they watched some of the parade from a reviewing stand built on pennsylvania avenue in front of the white house. trump takes office with work to do to improve his image. an abc news/washington post poll this week found only 40 percent of americans viewed him favorably, the lowest rating for an incoming president since democrat jimmy carter in 1977, and the same percentage approved of how he has handled the transition. trump’s rise, while welcomed by republicans tired of obama’s eight years in office, raises a host of questions for the united states. trump campaigned on a pledge to take the country on a more isolationist, protectionist path and he has vowed to impose a 35 percent tariff on imports from u.s. companies that went abroad. more than 60 democratic lawmakers stayed away from the proceedings to protest trump. many demonstrators will participate in a “women’s march on washington” on saturday. protests are also planned in other cities in the united states and abroad. trump’s to-do list has given republicans hope that, since they also control the u.s. congress, they can approve sweeping tax reform and roll back many federal regulations they say are stifling the u.s. economy, as well as repeal and replace obamacare. “he’s going to inject a shock to the system here almost immediately,” trump senior adviser kellyanne conway told fox news. democrats, in search of firm political footing after the unexpected defeat of clinton, are planning to fight him at every turn. trump’s critics have been emboldened to attack his legitimacy because his win came only in the electoral college, which gives smaller states more clout in the outcome. he lost the popular vote to clinton by about 2.9 million. trump’s critics also point to the conclusion of u.s. intelligence agencies that russia used hacking and other methods during the campaign to try to tilt the election in the republican’s favor. trump has acknowledged the finding - denied by moscow - that russia was behind the hacking but said it did not affect the outcome of the election.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.154545454545456,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
swiss president wants a vote to clarify country's eu position,"zurich (reuters) - a referendum in switzerland to clarify the country s relationship with the european union would be helpful, swiss president doris leuthard said on sunday, after ties between the two sides cooled this week. switzerland s frictions with the eu, of which it is not a member, arise as britain negotiates its withdrawal from the bloc following a referendum in june last year and seeks a new trading relationship with its closest neighbors. talks on securing a new framework treaty to govern the swiss-eu relationship have been underway for some time, with brussels wanting to replace the more than 100 bilateral accords which regulate its relationship with bern. but relations soured this week when the eu granted swiss stock exchanges only limited access to the bloc, prompting swiss threats of retaliation for what it called discrimination. the bilateral path is important, leuthard told swiss newspapers sonntags blick. we therefore have to clarify our relationship with europe. we have to know in which direction to go. therefore a fundamental referendum would be helpful. talks on the an all-encompassing agreement made headway last month after switzerland agreed to increase its contribution to the eu s budget. such a deal would ensure switzerland adopts relevant eu laws in return for enhanced access to the bloc s single market, crucial for swiss exports. but a deal would be opposed by the anti-eu swiss people s party (svp), currently the biggest group in parliament. leuthard, who steps down as president at the end of the year, said the latest row had not overshadowed her year in the rotating office. of course, the differences with brussels are now in focus. here our attitude is clear - for the eu to link such a technical thing like stock exchange equivalency with a political question like the framework treaty, that is not possible, she said some countries were putting switzerland in the same category as britain, while others wanted to strengthen their own financial centers at switzerland s expense. others think we are cherry pickers who benefit too much from the single european market, they want to increase pressure for a framework agreement, leuthard said. pressure from outside would did not contribute to a beneficial climate in switzerland over a potential agreement, she said. she said she understood swiss scepticism towards the eu, but there was no alternative to finding an accommodation with the bloc which generates around two thirds of swiss trade. we can strengthen the cooperation with india and china, but the eu remains central. we need a mechanism and regulated relationship with the eu, that would also prevent political games like we are having at the moment, leuthard said.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.55,16.0,0.0,0.0

u.s. bill to regulate internet ads gains bipartisan support with mccain,"(reuters) - u.s. legislation that would impose new disclosure requirements on political ads that run on facebook and other websites received support on wednesday from senator john mccain, giving a bipartisan boost to a bill already popular among democrats. mccain, a longtime supporter of regulating campaign finances, and two democratic senators, amy klobuchar and mark warner, plan to introduce the legislation on thursday, according to a statement from their offices on wednesday. republicans control the u.s. senate and house of representatives, so bills generally need republican support to advance. online political ads are much more loosely regulated in the united states than political ads on television, radio and satellite services. the lack of regulation was highlighted last month when facebook inc, alphabet inc’s google and twitter inc said that they had found election-related ad buys on their services made by people in russia in the run-up to last year’s u.s. presidential election. non-americans are generally not allowed to spend money to influence u.s. elections. the legislation from the three senators would put online ads under the same rules as television, radio and satellite, so that who paid for them and other information would need to be disclosed. last month, after u.s. regulators and criminal investigators began looking at the russia-linked ads, facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg said his company would take several voluntary steps to make political ads more transparent, such as allowing anyone to seem them no matter whom they target. facebook and twitter said on wednesday that they are open to working with lawmakers on the matter. google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. mccain’s office declined to comment.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.154545454545456,15.30909090909091,0.0,0.0

u.s. lawmakers press heritage pharma on high prices for antibiotic,"washington (reuters) - two u.s. lawmakers are questioning whether heritage pharmaceuticals misled them in response to a 2014 congressional inquiry about the rising price a common antibiotic, after 20 u.s. states this week accused the company of price fixing. in a dec. 16 letter to heritage seen by reuters, maryland democratic representative elijah cummings and vermont independent senator bernie sanders said they feared the company was “disingenuous at best” in october 2014 when it told them it had not seen any significant price increases for its doxycycline hyclate product. “we are very concerned that you made these assertions to congress on behalf of heritage during the exact time period that its executives were engaged in a price fixing scheme to prevent competition from driving down prices of doxycycline hyclate,” they wrote. in response to friday’s letter, the company said it does not make the same version of doxycycline hyclate that the lawmakers asked about in 2014. heritage makes a delayed release version, not the immediate release version that was the subject of the 2014 inquiry. heritage said it explained this to the lawmakers in its 2014 response. the letter to heritage comes after criminal and civil charges were filed by the justice department and 20 states in connection with an alleged price fixing scheme involving doxycycline hyclate and glyburide, a diabetes drug. on wednesday, the justice department criminally charged heritage’s former chief executive officer jeffrey glazer and former heritage vice president of commercial operations jason malek, accusing them of colluding with other generic manufacturers in schemes that entailed allocating market share and conspiring to raise prices. the next day, 20 states filed a parallel civil lawsuit against heritage, along with mylan nv, teva pharmaceuticals, mayne pharma group, citron pharma and aurobindo pharma ltd., saying they colluded to fix prices. the lawsuit characterized heritage as the “ringleader,” with glazer and malek overseeing and running the scheme. mylan and teva have previously denied the states’ civil charges. sanders and cummings launched a congressional inquiry into rising generic drug prices on oct. 2, 2014, including the price of doxycycline hyclate. as part of that, they sent a letter to glazer while he was still ceo of heritage to inquire about the prices. gary ruckelshaus, who was then heritage’s outside counsel and now serves as vice president and general counsel, responded later that month and said heritage “has not seen any significant price increases” for the drug.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.91,16.0,0.0,0.0

maine governor says he will not expand medicaid despite vote,"(reuters) - maine governor paul lepage said on wednesday he would not carry out an expansion of the state’s medicaid program under obamacare that was approved by voters unless it was fully funded by the legislature, calling it “ruinous” for the state’s budget. about 60 percent of voters in maine approved the ballot proposal in tuesday’s election, according to the bangor daily news, making the state the first in the country to vote to expand medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. lepage, a republican, has staunchly opposed expansion of the program, vetoing legislation to do so on several occasions. in a statement, the governor said he would not implement the expansion until it was fully funded by the maine legislature, where control is split between republicans and democrats. “credit agencies are predicting that this fiscally irresponsible medicaid expansion will be ruinous to maine’s budget,” lepage said in a statement. “i will not support increasing taxes on maine families, raiding the rainy day fund or reducing services to our elderly or disabled.” lepage said a previous medicaid expansion in maine in 2002 created $750 million in debt to hospitals and took resources away from vulnerable people. maine senate democratic leader troy jackson said in a statement that the governor “has the power to put up roadblocks to prevent implementation of the voter-approved medicaid expansion referendum, and i have no reason to believe he won’t continue to do as he has always done.” jackson added that democrats “are determined to use every tool at our disposal to ensure the will of the voters is upheld.” maine voters were asked to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverage under medicaid for adults under age 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two. if implemented, about 70,000 additional state residents would be eligible for the medicaid program, local media reported, in addition to the roughly 268,000 people who are currently eligible. maine has been prominent in the national healthcare debate. u.s. senator susan collins, a moderate republican from the state, helped block her party’s efforts to repeal obamacare, enacted under former democratic president barack obama and formally known as the affordable care act. collins said on wednesday she never took a position on state referendum questions, but was surprised at lepage’s statement. “i’m not going to comment on what the governor should or should not do”, collins told reporters. “i think it’s significant that healthcare was such a prominent issue and i believe when you look at the overwhelming vote in my state (on) the medicaid expansion that it shows that republicans need to put forth constructive legislation.”",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.1,7.190000000000001,12.0,0.0,0.0
liberalism yet to come: the boundaries of the thinkable,"by outis philalithopoulos in yesterday’s episode of this series , outis came up with an attractive synthesis about the trajectory of modern progressivism. he was then thrown into confusion by the arrival of a phantom, and cryptic references to “neoliberalism’s intellectual and cultural border guard.” i felt like a snake, compelled to painfully tear away one skin after another. the outline of my conclusions was the same, but in the cold light of reed’s words, things somehow appeared differently. is it true that we have surpassed postmodernism? we still look negatively at right wingers and others who believe in non-trendy absolutes. we still pay lip service to the idea that other cultures are just as praiseworthy as upper middle class american liberal culture. but looking beneath the surface, it does seem like postmodernism has been consigned to the graveyard of history. but rather than post-postmodernists who have learned from the mistakes of postmodernism, we are neo-modernists who have successfully forgotten that postmodernism ever existed. already in the 90s, parts of the left/liberal world were uncomfortable with postmodernism, and wendy brown argued that they had set up their own “reactionary foundationalism.” by that she meant that they had selected one aspect of their dogma, and then declared all attempts to interpret it critically to be subversive. our newfound unity is based on two prongs. on the one hand, we have consolidated our alliance with key sectors of modern capitalism, and thereby cemented our branding as well-educated, intelligent people. it is working out wonderfully – but have we paid a price for it? daniel bell argued in 1976 ( the cultural contradictions of capitalism ) that conservatives supporting capitalism were thereby supporting a cultural engine that undermined the social values central to their conservatism. have we, by letting the cultural arm of the economy fight our battles for us, clouded our ability to radically critique that economy? in the complex relationship between modern progressivism and the cultural sector of capitalism, who is using whom? on the other hand, we have fixed certain instances of suffering as foundational texts, and can now blast anyone who seems to doubt their centrality in understanding the world. earlier attempts to create a liberal culture based on a consensus about oppression tended to produce a hodgepodge of groups that centrifugal forces could easily pull apart. what was different now? maybe, as i had suggested to foucault, the internet had played a role. but 9/11 seemed relevant as well. as osama bin laden had hoped, the image of the planes striking the towers appeared on television as a dramatic flash of absolute reality. in the new rhetorical world thus created, “squishy” postmodernism came off as inane and decadent; meanwhile, neocon republicans happily twitted liberals over their lack of moral clarity. the right surged from one apparent victory to another, while liberals seethed with humiliation. maybe there was no epistemological breakthrough that enabled us to answer the postmodernists’ gnawing doubts about objectivity. maybe we changed the nature of liberalism, absorbed the stubborn moral clarity of rush limbaugh’s conservatism, and went on to forge a rough-and-ready consensus between unruly interest groups, simply because we believed we had to. morality as stylized images of suffering inject us with potent shots of certainty, we become addicted to empathy with suffering, as an antidote for existential disorientation. this leads to a natural desire to expand our attention to micro-aggressions and hurtful ways of thinking. but then, if we commit to being on the side of people who experience micro-aggressions, almost everyone might be able to find something in their life that could qualify. and in fact, many groups for whom we feel little sympathy are not unwilling to talk about their pain and humiliation. we have dodged this trap by finding a principle that will disqualify unintended groups from empathy – that way we can classify their pain as notreal. the simple rule that does the trick is: “if a group has suffered something historical that we agree is really, unmistakably horrible , then it is also allowed to claim micro-aggressions as real.” we dress it up in academic language about what counts as “structural” oppression, but in simple words, the rule is, “if a group suffered, and we have canonized their suffering as a source of moral clarity for us , then they should be allowed to freely discover further incitements to suffering.” so in judy’s movie, mocking older people, or rural people, or government employees, or overweight people, is all entirely acceptable , while carrying around fox repellent, thinking a sheep’s fur is fluffy, calling a bunny cute, or not supporting a baby fox who wants to be an elephant are all entirely unacceptable. t he principle isn’t that prejudice is wrong. the principle is that the latter examples are code for liberal flash points. i thought about something brown said: in its emergence as a protest against marginalization or subordination, politicized identity […] instills its pain over its unredeemed history in the very foundation of its political claim […] politicized identity enunciates itself, makes claims for itself, only by entrenching, restating, dramatizing, and inscribing its pain in politics; it can hold out no future – for itself or others – that triumphs over this pain. by “instilling” pain at the center of our epistemological universe, we condemn ourselves to endless efforts to shuttle around, direct, and amplify that pain. brown emphasized revenge as a key technique in dealing with pain: […] a will that makes not only a psychological but a political practice of revenge, […] an identity whose present past is one of insistently unredeemable injury. zootopia offers plenty of examples of hurting people the way they hurt others, so they can see what it feels like, and learn. the response to nick tricking judy and telling her “it’s a hustle, sweetheart” is for her to trick him and then announce, “it’s a hustle, sweetheart.” the same line is then used on the evil female sheep at the end of the movie. the movie sees cultural insensitivity as not only the primary evil in the world, but also the most appropriate punishment – the final prison episode also came to mind, when i had laughed at the evil sheep’s anger at her wool getting touched. the culmination of judy’s apology is announcing that she really is “just a dumb bunny” – her guilt is so great that she knows she deserves the pain of stereotyping. brown worried about the insatiable dead end of “insistently irredeemable injury.” here, though, modern liberal culture proposesa way out of the cycle of suffering and revenge – judy models it for us in her apology to nick. if the oppressor voluntarily decides to submit to the worst tortures the oppressed can inflict, and to bind herself as an instrument of his revenge, then he may choose to forgive her, making possible a triumph over pain. i had always thought that when people do something wrong, they should just stop caring about their own feelings and, like judy, really, deeply apologize. in the movie, nick had forgiven her. but in real life, if someone apologized like that, say in a professional context, and the other person chose to be unmerciful – what then? imagining the future wendy brown said that right wing fundamentalists were trying to “foreclose democratic conversation about our collective condition and future.” are we doing the same thing? adolph reed maybe thought so. what did he mean when he said we had become “border guards of neoliberalism,” policing “the boundaries of the thinkable”? of course we work hard to stigmatize certain sorts of prejudices. do we thereby successfully repress them? foucault, in his history of sexuality , recalled that it is often supposed that the victorian era’s rules of manners and taboos on sexuality were aimed at making sex “driven out, denied, and reduced to silence.” he argued instead that those restrictions had the effect, and maybe the purpose, of inciting and intensifying the power of sexuality: a “complex deployment for compelling sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon” it. if foucault was right about sexuality, are our attempts at “repressing” prejudice and trauma serving to amplify them as a force in society, by “compelling prejudice and trauma to speak,” “fastening our attention” upon them? is the result then to drown out attempts to speak in other ways, and so to police “the boundaries of the thinkable”? is the neoliberal order safeguarded by the fact that certain conversations just don’t happen in mainstream progressive circles? well, it does seem that star trek is better at imagining an economic system without money than modern progressives maybe we see a radical stance on the economy as a quick way to brand oneself as edgy, while privately assuming that there is no alternative to modern capitalism. if so, why continue to be so moralistic about it? is our compulsive focus on mental sin a way we cover up despair at our inability to change the deep structure of the world? a lot of ordinary people are convinced not that capitalism is perfect, but that any alternative to it is will necessarily involve the collapse of technological civilization or severe restrictions on freedom. if this isn’t true, are there some progressives trying to explain why? i struggled with what i had perceived. were we, despite our idealistic vision of ourselves, simply agents of the system, tentacles that it uses to smash some people, complete with the pretext of defending others? was it a labyrinthine, twisted joke? hope at that point, i rebelled at the implications of my thought. maybe modern progressives are much less self-critical than we imagined ourselves to be. maybe we do indulge in some prejudices while criticizing and often tokenizing others. maybe we have acquiesced in a long series of accommodations with power. but polyphemus had spoken not just of wretchedness, but of idealism and grandeur. maybe i didn’t agree with the postmodernists after all. maybe there is something good, or at least potentially good, in the way we have tried to turn back to sincerity and moral conviction, to humility and introspection. brown said that in the postmodern world, individuals are buffeted and controlled by global configuations of […] power of extraordinary proportions, and are at the same time nakedly individuated, stripped of reprieve […] since she wrote, the way the world makes many feel precarious and lost has only gotten worse. maybe she was right that when we feel this way, we try to rebuild a sense of something we can really believe in. but was she right in assuming that this was mainly a bad thing? when judy apologizes to nick, she treats herself as utterly insignificant, and her victim as omnipotent, exactly mimicking the relationship between the sinner and god in traditional christian confession. this was extreme, but could it also be seen as the sign of a great and widely-shared loneliness? of the longing we feel for more dramatically intimate relationships between people, or between a person and some sort of transcendence? could we salvage what was hopeful in modern progressivism and disentangle it from what wasn’t? that sounds… hard, i thought to myself. anyway, i’m dead. maybe someone else will worry about it. then i remembered judy hopps. she wouldn’t accept me being dead as a reason for me not to try to help people. what could i do? “polyphemus,” i cried out. “you’re back.” he surveyed me. “what have you learned?” his voice boomed. i thought for a moment. then i realized how to solve this problem. “polyphemus,” i said. “i have learned that i have been ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. when i hear criticism of liberals that i don’t want to think about, i deal with it by explaining how right-wingers caused the problem, or are worse than us, or are scary or horrible. or i say the criticism is justified, but only as a criticism of not-real-progressives. or i divert attention by accusing critics of ignoring the horrible things that have been done to marginalized people. i say i am against prejudice and trauma, but my attempts to repress certain forms of them have the predictable effect of intensifying their power throughout society. i say i am against prejudice, but i don’t mind making fun of old people, millennials, hicks, wingnuts, adults who live with their parents, and a whole slew of other categories and stereotypes. i say i am against capitalism, but i’m completely fine with corporate action when it imposes antiracism, feminism, and other aspects of liberal culture. if someone raises an objection, i accuse them of opposing antiracism or feminism. i have the privilege of knowing that i can repel any attack on my basic understanding of reality. i really am a horrible hypocrite; some of the things i do hurt people, abet an atmosphere of shaming and guilt, and ultimately foreclose any possibility of positive change.” “how do you feel now?” polyphemus inquired. “great,” i responded. “i feel great.” “so will you honor the spirit of true progressivism in your heart, and try to keep it always?” he demanded. “perhaps,” i said. “but not just now. a bootleg copy of the latest game of thrones season just made it past charon. and anyway, i’ve faced my fears, i’ve recognized my progressive privilege, and i feel like i’ve really grown through this experience.” polyphemus smirked at me. i smirked back. epilogue: and so i thought no more about these matters, and have been able to return to my comfortable existence in the underworld. i no longer need this diary, and am casting it into a bottle so that it can dance along the eddies of fate, troubling whom it may. outis philalithopoulos",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.89777777777778,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0
the gay men killed in fl. shooting would not have been able to donate blood today,"blood donations are urgently needed in the orlando, florida area following saturday night s massacre. so far, 50 people have died in the massacre and at least 53 are hospitalized due to injuries. the shooting took place at pulse, an lgbt nightclub.the current crisis reveals the incredibly homophobic rules put in place by the fda regarding blood donations. the fda s current rules stipulate that any man who has had sex with another man cannot donate blood until they have been celibate for one year. this bars nearly all gay and bisexual men from being able to donate blood.according to reports, one blood, a blood donation center in orlando, has temporarily lifted the ban on blood for their organization, allowing men who have had homosexual intercourse donate to their organization. one blood reports that their blood donation center is currently at capacity. however, they will still need high numbers of donations over the next few days in order to keep replenishing their stock. a tremendous response by blood donors in light of the tragic mass shooting in orlando. we are asking donors to donate over the next several days to help replenish the blood supply. we are asking people please make an appointment online or call 1.888.9.donate (1.888.936.6283). thank you! as our nation collectively mourns the massive loss of life in florida, it is a good time for us to look at the institutionalized homophobia that helps to create a culture that determines that lgbt lives and bodies are lesser than that of heteronormative individuals. right now, the blood of gay and bisexual men, as well as so many others, stains the interior of the pulse nightclub. orlando s mayor buddy dyer, described the scene by saying: there s blood everywhere. as far as the fda is concerned, the blood of those who died on saturday had no value to living.blood is thoroughly screened by blood donation organizations no matter who donates to them. there is no need for this discriminatory policy. nothing should prevent a healthy person from being able to give the gift of saving a life. the horror that occurred on saturday night proved that gay, bisexual, straight, man, women, black, or white we all bleed and that all life is precious.featured image from photo by tim matsui/getty images",1,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,2.280000000000001,3.2,0.0625,0.0
"after turbulent week, trump revisits talk of 'rigged election'","portsmouth, n.h. (reuters) - u.s. republican presidential nominee donald trump, fighting to overcome setbacks and polls showing a tough path to the white house, on saturday doubled down on his claim that the u.s. election is rigged against him. trump challenged accusations from several women that he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. trump spokesman jason miller denied a new allegation that surfaced on saturday, saying there was “no way” trump had kissed a woman without permission 20 years ago at his florida resort. trump told an outdoor rally in new hampshire on saturday that the media was sharing the accusations against him to boost democrat hillary clinton and damage his own white house hopes. trump has presented no evidence for claims he has made for months that the election could be fixed to prevent him from reaching the oval office. leaders on both sides of the political spectrum worry that this rhetoric, which supporters sometimes repeat in interviews, undermines the democratic process. “it looks to me like a rigged election,” trump said in new hampshire. “the election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president.” he started the day tweeting several times that the election was being swayed by a media conspiracy. “this election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect crooked hillary!” he said in one twitter post. he reiterated similar claims at a later rally in bangor, maine. clinton, a former u.s. secretary of state, led trump by seven percentage points in the most recent reuters/ipsos national opinion poll of voters. a new analysis found she was heavily favored to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency. trump’s campaign said on saturday it had raised a total of $100 million in september, mostly from small donors but also including a $2 million monthly contribution from trump. at the same time, the campaign squabbled with the republican party in ohio, a key swing state in the nov. 8 election, whose republican leaders have not been shy about concerns with trump. on saturday, trump’s ohio state director released a letter saying that ohio republican party chairman matt borges “no longer has any affiliation” with the campaign. borges responded that the state party had been actively helping trump there. trump’s speech in new hampshire was intended to focus on a plan to end deaths caused by opioid overdoses, something he often mentions on the campaign trail. but he deviated from policy proposals to air his allegations of election-rigging and his response to new groping accusations, 24 days before the election. trump has been fending off the accusations since the release of a 2005 video in which he was recorded bragging about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. trump has said the boasts were merely words and he has denied each of the allegations. the latest woman to come forward, cathy heller, 63, of new york, told the guardian newspaper that in or around 1997, trump kissed her on the lips upon first meeting her during a mother’s day brunch at his florida estate. she told the newspaper she leaned away, then turned her head, and he kissed the side of her mouth. reuters could not confirm the allegations by heller, who has contributed to clinton’s campaign. the guardian said it spoke to a relative who saw part of the interaction. “there is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on mother’s day at mr. trump’s resort,” miller, the trump spokesman, said in a statement. “it would have been the talk of palm beach for the past two decades.” on saturday, trump deemed “crazy” another woman, jessica leeds, now 74, who said he groped her on an airplane in or around 1980. he also denied allegations of unwanted contact by summer zervos, a former contestant on trump’s show “the apprentice,” who said he kissed her during a meeting about a possible job. trump said zervos’ first cousin called her a “huge fan of donald trump,” referring to a letter the campaign released to media. trump also told the new hampshire crowd that he and clinton were “like athletes” gearing up for the final presidential debate on wednesday in las vegas, and he implied clinton might have been on drugs during their last match-up. “i think we should take a drug test prior to the debate,” trump said. “in the beginning of her last debate she was all pumped up at the beginning and at the end she was like uh, take me down.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.89777777777778,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0

(washington, dc) a professor who specializes in the civil war appeared on a special edition of “the jim bakker show” last week to warn america that the 2016 presidential election could lead to another secessionist melee. “i’m a civil war historian,” the montreat college professor, william forstchen , explained by way of introduction. the u.s. election of 1860 “is the closest i can parallel this to,” forstchen said. “and we all know what the price was,” the professor then said. “when we went to a civil war, they killed 660,000 young men because we became so divided.” next, forstchen went on a lengthy diatribe about the u.s. constitution and the importance of voting. he urged “those of you who feel ‘i can’t quite pull the lever for this person or that person'” in the presidential election to vote because u.s. senators and representatives are up for election, and because the senate must confirm supreme court justices. forstchen failed to explain how the results of the 2016 election will hasten — or prevent — a civil war. he also did not specifically mention or endorse any candidates for office. nevertheless, the professor concluded with an adamant exhortation that a civil war is nigh. “i do believe we are at 1860,” forstchen said, looking directly into the camera. “we are that close to the edge of the debacle.” from there, another guest, baptist pastor carl gallups, declared that “the prophecy clock started ticking” when the modern nation of israel was established in 1948. gallups, who introduced donald trump at a donald trump rally in january 2016, is famous because he has used his radio show to give a platform to people who deny the reality of the 2012 sandy hook elementary school shooting, according to the connecticut post http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/trump-disavows-sandy-hook-truther-who-6880064.php. gallups has also said he believes neither marco rubio nor ted cruz are eligible to be president because of the circumstances of their births. the segment featuring forstchen and gallups was part of the jim bakker show’s weeklong “ready now expo oct. 2016”— featuring several survival products. four candidates received any substantive amount of votes in the u.s. presidential election in 1860: abraham lincoln (39.8 percent), stephen douglas (29.5 percent), john breckinridge (18.1 percent) and john bell (12.6 percent). on december 20, 1860, delegates to a convention in south carolina unanimously voted to secede from the united states — 44 days after lincoln, a republican, was elected. montreat college, forstchen’s employer, is a small christian liberal arts college with a main campus located in rural north carolina. forstchen has written a couple dozen novels and several short stories. his co-author for some of the books is newt gingrich. this article was contributed by daily caller please contact trunews correspondent edward szall with any news tips related to this story. email: | twitter: @edwardszall | facebook: ed szall download the trunews mobile app on apple and google play ! donate today! support trunews to help build a global news network that provides a credible source for world news we believe christians need and deserve their own global news network to keep the worldwide church informed, and to offer christians a positive alternative to the anti-christian bigotry of the mainstream news media top stories",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0

turkey says doesn't want greece to become 'safe haven' for coup plotters,"ankara (reuters) - turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu urged greece on tuesday to not become a safe haven for plotters of last year s coup attempt, citing the 995 people who have applied for asylum since the failed putsch. speaking at a joint news conference with his greek counterpart, nikos kotzias, cavusoglu said asylum seekers needed to be evaluated to determine those linked to the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen, blamed by turkey for masterminding the putsch. we would not want our neighbor greece, with whom we are improving our ties, to be a safe haven for gulenists. we believe these applications will be evaluated meticulously and that traitors will not be given credit, cavusoglu said. responding to cavusoglu s comments, kotzias said the decisions on asylum seekers were made by the greek judiciary and had to be respected even if it doesn t please some . relations between turkey and greece were further strained in may after a greek court ruled to not extradite eight turkish soldiers who fled to greece following last year s coup attempt. turkey alleges the men, who fled to greece in a military helicopter as the july coup unfolded, were involved in efforts to overthrow president tayyip erdogan and has repeatedly demanded they be sent back. greek courts have blocked two extradition requests by ankara, drawing an angry rebuke from turkey and highlighting the tense relations between the nato allies, who remain at odds over issues from territorial disputes to ethnically split cyprus. unfortunately, the greek courts did not extradite (the eight soldiers), and this has greatly disappointed us, cavusoglu said. he said two other soldiers, accused of trying to assassinate erdogan on the night of the coup, had also fled to greece, and that turkey had demanded their extradition. in the aftermath of the coup, some 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and more than 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors. rights groups and turkey s western allies have said president tayyip erdogan is using the failed coup as a pretext to crush dissent, but the government says the measures are necessary to fight the threats it is facing.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.806666666666668,4.800000000000001,0.0,0.0

quandary in south sudan: should it lose its hard-won independence? - the new york times,"nairobi, kenya — tens of thousands of civilians dead, countless children on the verge of starvation, millions of dollars stolen by officials, oil wells blown up, food aid hijacked and as many as 70 percent of women sheltering in camps raped — mostly by the nation’s soldiers and police officers. just a few years ago, south sudan accomplished what seemed impossible: independence. of all the quixotic rebel armies fighting for freedom in africa, the south sudanese actually won. global powers, including the united states, rallied to their side, helping to create the world’s newest country in 2011, a supposed solution to decades of conflict and suffering. now, with millions of its people hungry or displaced by civil war, a radical question has emerged: should south sudan lose its independence? as international frustrations and worries grow, some momentum is growing for a proposal for outside powers to take over south sudan and run it as a trusteeship until things calm down. several academics and prominent opposition figures support the idea, citing east timor, kosovo and bosnia as places where, they say, it has worked, though of course there are plenty of cautionary tales where outside intervention failed, like somalia and iraq. the ugandan scholar mahmood mamdani recently floated a plan in which the african union would take the lead in setting up a transitional government for south sudan. ideally, mr. mamdani said, none of the current south sudanese politicians who have helped drag their nation into civil war would be able to participate, and the trusteeship would last around six years, requiring united nations support. “the response to the crisis will need to be as extraordinary as the crisis,” he said. but there is one problem. many south sudanese might not go for it. according to james solomon padiet, a lecturer at juba university, most members of the nation’s largest ethnic group — the dinka, who include south sudan’s embattled president, salva kiir — are adamantly set against an international takeover. while smaller ethnic groups would welcome it, he said, the powerful dinka see it as an affront to their sovereignty. for that matter, so does mr. padiet, a scholar who is not a dinka. he called trusteeship “offensive” because south sudan has a potential crop of good leaders waiting in the wings who haven’t had a chance to rule. still, mr. padiet conceded, the country desperately needs help. “as we speak now,” he said, “south sudan is at crossroads of disintegration or total fragility. ” clashes have spread to new areas of the country, and militias are mobilizing in the bush. it’s all a staggering plunge from the country’s birth. i, along with hundreds of other journalists, was standing in a crowd that felt like a million people on july 9, 2011, the insanely hot day when south sudan broke off from sudan. the sense of pride, sacrifice, hope and jubilation will be hard to forget. for decades, south sudanese rebels had battled the central government of sudan. they fought in malarial swamps and on sweltering savannas, incredibly hostile environments where it’s hard to survive, let alone wage a guerrilla war on a shoestring. the south sudanese had absorbed bombings and massacres. the arabs stole their children and turned them into slaves. as a result, many south sudanese were scattered across the four corners of the earth — the famous lost boys, but also many lost girls, ripped from their families and forced to flee to cold foreign places that they had never envisioned. on independence day, south sudan’s capital, juba, partied until dawn. lost boys swigged white bull (the local beer) next to hardened guerrillas bobbing their heads to reggae rap. all around us, there seemed to be a real appreciation of what had been achieved and what lay ahead. most important, there was unity. that crumbled quickly, undermined by old political rivalries, ethnic tension and a greed for south sudan’s one main export: oil. the fault line was the most predictable one, the dinka versus the nuer. the two biggest ethnic groups had alternated between allies and enemies throughout south sudan’s liberation wars. starting in december 2013, after a breakdown between their political leaders, who not so long ago had been hailed as heroes, nuer and dinka militias began killing each other and civilians across the country, especially in ethnically mixed areas. women were raped. children were burned to death. some people were even forced at gunpoint to eat the flesh of their dead relatives. the horror has been meticulously documented. still, it goes on. for years, the united nations has stationed thousands of peacekeepers in the country, but often they have not intervened. in 2012, shortly after independence, i rushed to a remote town, pibor, where hundreds had just been massacred by an ethnic militia. i saw one woman who was literally holding her arm together — she had been blasted by a kalashnikov — as she sat in a medical tent that smelled of decaying flesh. she stared at the wall, not making a murmur. i interviewed peacekeepers who told me how they had watched civilians get shot right in front of them, yet the peacekeepers felt too scared to raise their rifles. united nations officials in juba have been excoriated for failing to spring into action and effectively step between mr. kiir and riek machar, the former vice president and the most influential nuer, as their rivalry intensified and grew into nationwide bloodshed. this is a big reason some people think an international trusteeship will never work. “having completely failed in the international project, now we’re going to move to an international takeover? with what army?” asked john prendergast, who has been working on south sudan for 30 years and the enough project, an group. “would the same international bureaucrats that undertook massive experiments in iraq and afghanistan come to juba to lead another failed political intervention?” he added. “it all seems fantastical, doomed and extremely unlikely. ” other scholars take a middle view. amir idris, chairman of fordham’s african and studies department and a frequent writer on south sudan, said an international trusteeship should be considered — but only as a last resort. he says the most important issue is that a new government be built with new people, including academics and technocrats. “south sudan has no chance of transitioning itself to a functioning state unless the edifice of the current leadership is brought down,” he said. bronwyn bruton, the deputy director of the africa center at the atlantic council, called south sudan’s leaders “such a disaster. ” she said mr. kiir and mr. machar were “corrupt,” “ ” and “willing to stoke ethnic conflict and commit horrible violence in pursuit of power. ” “genocide is beginning to look inevitable,” she said. “the situation could hardly be more hopeless. ” but she worries that no country has the appetite to spearhead a meaningful intervention. the obama administration considered several ways to help usher in a political transition, a former administration official said, but eventually concluded it was not feasible. it’s not as if mr. kiir or mr. machar or their inner circles, who are widely believed to continue to profit from oil and conflict, are going to volunteer to step aside. thousands of armed men are intensely loyal to them, and even a few friends left in western capitals make the case that the south sudanese government has stabilized juba in recent months, has become more inclusive and should be allowed to stay. one glimmer of hope comes from across the continent. in the last few days, troops from several west african countries banded together to eject gambia’s president, who tried to stay in power illegally. if such resolve was demonstrated in this part of africa, then maybe, the interventionists argue, south sudan’s leaders could be pushed aside and the country would be allowed to breathe.",0,15,0.0,0,1,0,0.10526315789473684,4.840000000000003,8.514285714285714,0.06666666666666667,0.0
hillary is the perfection of a corrupt system,"leave a reply charles hugh smith – let’s set aside hillary clinton as an individual and consider her as the perfection of a corrupt political system. as i noted yesterday, politics as usual is dead , and hillary clinton is the ultimate product of the political system that is disintegrating before our eyes. the corruption of pay-to-play and the commingling of public and private influence is not the failing of an individual–it is the logical conclusion of a thoroughly corrupt political system. given the incentives built into politics as usual, public/private pay-to-play doesn’t just make sense–it is the only possible maximization of the political system. cobble together a multi-million dollar private foundation, millions of dollars in speaking fees from big-money contributors, conflicts of interest, the secrecy of private email servers, pay-to-play schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the department of justice, and the inevitable result is a politics as usual money-harvesting machine that lays waste to the nation, supporters and critics alike. all the clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else.now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in “contributions” and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds. the nation’s political system needs a thorough cleaning from top to bottom. exposing the clintons’ perfection of politics as usual won’t change the conditions and incentives that created the clintons’ harvester of corruption. that will require rooting out the incentives that made the clintons’ perfection of corruption both logical and inevitable. sf source of two minds nov. 2016 share this:",1,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.180000000000003,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0

mexico says trump-pena nieto meet unlikely to lead to big deals,"mexico city (reuters) - a meeting between mexican president enrique pena nieto and u.s. president donald trump on friday at the g20 summit in germany will last about 30 minutes and probably not lead to any major agreements, mexico’s foreign minister said on wednesday. the face-to-face talks will be the first between pena nieto and trump as presidents. mexican foreign minister luis videgaray warned not to expect too much. “we have to put it in context and not have expectations that are unjustified,” videgaray said. trump’s election and his early days in office strained relations between the two neighbors because of his threats to apply tariffs to mexican-made goods and a plan to build a wall on the southern u.s. border and force mexico to pay for it. trump and pena nieto will discuss renegotiations of the north american free trade agreement scheduled for august, as well as cooperation in combating drug cartels and development in central america, the foreign ministry said. pena nieto will also talk about the rights of mexican migrants in the united states, the ministry said. later on wednesday, pena nieto and videgaray met with u.s. homeland security secretary john kelly, who was visiting mexico ahead of the g20 summit along with cia director mike pompeo. according to a statement from pena nieto’s office, both sides agreed to work together on security and pena nieto praised the trump administration’s decision to keep in place a program that allows some immigrants, brought into the country illegally by their parents, to stay. one topic not on the agenda at the encounter in hamburg is trump’s pledge to build a wall on the u.s.-mexico border, videgaray said in an earlier television interview. in late january, a planned meeting between the two presidents was canceled following a twitter dispute over trump’s pledge to make mexico pay for the wall, which the mexican government has insisted it will not do. trump has since said he will find a way for mexico to repay the united states for construction of the wall but that congress would need to fund it first. his administration also toned down threats to pull out of the nafta pact with mexico and canada. last august, during trump’s presidential campaign, he accepted an invitation to visit mexico in what became a public relations disaster for pena nieto, who was widely condemned for inviting a man who has united mexicans like few others in shared disdain.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.009090909090911,15.30909090909091,0.0,0.0

u.s. congress passes $618.7 billion annual defense bill,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. senate overwhelmingly passed a compromise version of an annual defense policy bill on thursday without controversial provisions such as requiring women to register for the draft or allowing contractors to make religion-based hiring decisions. ninety-two senators backed the $618.7 billion national defense authorization act, or ndaa, and seven opposed it. because it passed the house of representatives by a similarly large margin last week, the bill now goes to the white house for president barack obama to veto or sign into law. a white house spokesman told a briefing he did not yet have a position on the bill to report. the 2016 bill, the last of obama’s presidency, includes some republican-backed initiatives with which he has disagreed in the past. it includes a $3.2 billion increase in military spending, when there has been no similar increase in non-defense funding. the bill also bars closures of military bases, although top pentagon officials say they have too much capacity, and it blocks planned reductions in active-duty troop numbers. and it continues policies that bar transfers of prisoners to u.s. soil from the detention center at guantanamo bay, cuba, which obama had hoped to close. while his administration has shipped most inmates from the controversial prison, the democrat is not expected to accomplish his goal of shuttering it before he leaves office jan. 20. obama’s successor, republican donald trump, wants to keep guantanamo open, and expand it. the ndaa passed both chambers in the republican-led congress with margins large enough to overcome a veto, and the compromise legislation features many provisions such as a military pay raise and an expansion of a landmark human rights bill, that are extremely popular in congress. [l1n1e316a] after months of negotiation, the senate and house armed services committees unveiled a compromise version of the ndaa last month that left out the russell amendment, a “religious freedom” measure democrats said would have let federal contractors discriminate against workers on the basis of gender or sexual orientation, overturning obama’s executive order. some house republicans said they hoped to revisit that provision after trump takes office, when they do not have to worry about a veto threat from a democratic white house. the bill also excluded a provision that would have required women to register for the military draft, now that pentagon leaders are moving to allow them into combat. a provision recommending that the u.s. conducts yearly high-level military exchanges with taiwan, which beijing sees as a breakaway province, made it into the final bill. china’s defense ministry said in a statement on its official microblog on friday that it was “firmly opposed” to the move, which would “inevitably damage u.s. interests”.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.620000000000001,6.6000000000000005,0.0,0.0
desperate travelers crowd puerto rico airport in hopes of seat out,"san juan, puerto rico (reuters) - hundreds of stranded tourists and puerto ricans seeking to leave filled the sweltering halls of san juan international airport on monday anxious for a seat on one of the few flights operating after hurricane maria devastated power and communications across the island. fearful of checking out of hotels in case they could not get on the few flights available, worried visitors waited in long lines at puerto rico s main airport, struggling to reach loved ones and airlines by phone. everything is hearsay at the moment because there is no communication, said 31-year-old rene kessler, a medical student from baltimore, maryland, preparing to spend the night in the terminal ahead of what he hoped would be a flight home. a microcosm of the storm-battered island, san juan airport is a top priority in efforts by puerto rico s cash-strapped government to rebuild after maria. experts say the work will take months and likely cost tens of billions of dollars. the screens above american airlines desks were dark, while jetblue s displays flowed with red rows of cancellations. staff called out the names of passengers who won seats on the few departing planes. everyone is in the same boat, trying to get out, said leyla colon, standing in line with her 4-year-old daughter at the jetblue terminal. without internet or cell service, she was unable to buy tickets before reaching the airport. at this point i ll buy a ticket on any flight to get out of here, colon said. carriers said downed infrastructure had caused operations to be scaled back sharply. in some cases, airlines used a nearby hospital to print flight manifests. and some customers were given handwritten boarding passes. mike henderson, a construction firm superintendent, was trying to return to his family in detroit after his wife paid $2,000 dollars for a seat on a delta flight. but airline staff were unable to tell him if he was on the passenger list, he said. i m drained, henderson said with a sigh. airlines on sunday were restricted to one or two flights a day, and transportation security administration workers manually inspected bags and patted down passengers. outside the airport, rows of diesel generators roared in the heat. they have been life-savers but have had their side effects too. miguel gonzalez, 42, said he was at the airport to get his asthmatic mother a flight to florida. he was hospitalized for two weeks due to fumes from neighbors generators that were fired up after hurricane irma hit the island early in september. maria dealt an even heavier blow to local infrastructure, putting immense pressure on medical services. jessica negron, a resident of orlando, florida, said she had been in the airport since friday waiting for a frontier flight. they keep changing the story, she said. nearby, eating canned peaches with a plastic knife, were allyson and marcus singletary from georgia. they said the storm and airport chaos had ruined their anniversary trip. this is the vacation from hell, said allyson, 31. this is the walking dead without zombies.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.936363636363637,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0
#grammyssowhite came to life. will the awards face its race problem? - the new york times,"before the rapper of a tribe called quest shouted “resist! resist! resist!” at the top of his lungs at the grammy awards before busta rhymes called donald j. trump “president agent orange” and referenced his “unsuccessful attempt at the muslim ban” before tribe and anderson . paak kicked their way through an oversize wall and brought dozens of people of a wide range of nationalities onstage (along with a dance troupe that recalled public enemy’s s1ws) introduced his group’s performance with some words of encouragement and defiance: “we’d like to say to all of those people around the world, all of those people who are pushing people who are in power to represent them: tonight, we represent you. ” these were words for the disenfranchised from a stage that has long connoted power and influence. in the current political moment, in which membership in the american experiment is subject to greater and greater obstacles, this performance was a loud statement of pushback. that is especially true given that the grammys find themselves in the throes of similar friction over belonging. simply put, the grammys, like america, have an inclusion problem — or more to the point, an exclusion problem. the 59th annual installment of the ceremony, at the staples center in los angeles on sunday night, was as noteworthy for who won as who didn’t, for who attended as for who opted to sit out. it was a show about borders — who is allowed to cross, who isn’t and who doesn’t even bother trying. adele won all five grammys she was nominated for, including album of the year (for “25”) record of the year and song of the year (for “hello”) besting beyoncé in all three categories. “25” is adele’s least impressive album, but its soul belting is the sort of classicism likely to appeal to the recording academy voting members, who tend to skew older and more traditional. beyoncé’s album “lemonade” (and the song “formation,” nominated in the other two categories) is musically provocative and wide ranging, and rife with commentary about the meaning of blackness in the united states. at the end of the night, when adele won album of the year, she deferred to beyoncé: “the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering,” adele told her from the stage, while behind her, a huge gaggle of predominantly white male songwriters and producers clapped enthusiastically. in that moment, just a few feet separated adele and beyoncé, but the chasm between their treatment by the grammys was huge, and potentially unbridgeable. it was #grammyssowhite come to life. for years, kanye west has complained about how black artists — himself, but also others — are mistreated in the main grammy categories. this year, frank ocean, fatigued with the grammys’ handling of black music, opted to not even submit his music for consideration. (the other big category, best new artist, was won by a black artist, chance the rapper.) the grammys’ race problem is so pernicious that some white winners have chosen contrition over exuberance — adele’s embrace of beyoncé, macklemore’s apology to kendrick lamar in 2014 (macklemore reportedly did not submit his most recent album for consideration this year) — demonstrating a greater understanding of the fundamental imbalance of the grammys system than the grammys themselves. despite minor rule changes and lip service to the idea of better representation, the grammys remain on the defensive. in the days leading up to this year’s telecast, the show’s longtime producer, ken ehrlich, deflected mr. ocean’s criticisms in an interview with rolling stone, earning a rebuke from mr. ocean on tumblr: “use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, i’m one of the best alive. and if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then i’m all for it. ” the grammys’ consistent celebration of white acts feels like rule in an evenly divided nation, while the royalty from the other side — beyoncé and jay z, jennifer lopez, rihanna — looks on politely from the front rows. (or, in the case of mr. west and mr. ocean, who did not attend the grammys, not even looking on.) there was also frisson in the ceremony’s lumpy attempts to bridge the age gap: when the show tried to highlight the work of neil diamond, via a clumsily executed version of james corden’s “carpool karaoke” routine, it was clear that most of the assembled stars didn’t know the words to “sweet caroline. ” and in a country in which around 15 percent of the population — more than 50 million people — speaks spanish, there were no or even bilingual, performances. the language was heard only during the segment, and in a johnnie walker ad that featured a pointed bilingual cover of “this land is your land” by the los angeles band chicano batman. again, strictly controlled borders. it’s in these moments that the grammys’ lack of imagination and tolerance contrasts with the general progressive political stances of the artists it celebrates. during the show, ms. lopez quoted toni morrison on the role of art in fraught political times. katy perry performed “chained to the rhythm,” her new single, with an armband that read “persist” — a reference to elizabeth warren’s recent senate silencing — and concluded in front of an image of the constitution. beyoncé performed in a gold crown that suggested a futuristic lady liberty, and during her acceptance speech for best urban contemporary album, preached about the power of inclusion: “it’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families — as well as the news, the super bowl, the olympics, the white house and the grammys — and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent and capable. ” honoring beyoncé in categories devoted to black music goes part of the way to fulfilling that vision, but it’s where she’s not honored that feels more pointed: she has won 22 times, but only four of those awards have been in categories. (she has lost album of the year three times, to beck, taylor swift and adele.) so long as the grammys continue to strike a blow for the values of yesteryear over the energy of today, they will remain an agent of the status quo, not resistance or evolution. but when an institution stands still while its citizens are pressing for change, how long can the borders hold before everyone outside is let in, or everyone inside decides it’s not worth staying, and leaves?",0,16,0.0,0,1,0,0.05263157894736842,1.3066666666666684,4.666666666666667,0.0,0.0

britain says moody's downgrade based on 'outdated' brexit view,"london (reuters) - britain s government said on friday that a decision by ratings agency moody s to downgrade the country s credit rating was based on an outdated assessment of its plans to leave the european union. moody s lowered britain s sovereign credit rating to aa2 with a stable outlook from aa1. the assessments made about brexit in this report are outdated, a government spokesperson said in a statement provided by the finance ministry. earlier on friday, prime minister theresa may gave a speech in italy setting out her wish for a transition period of around two years after britain leaves the eu in march 2019. the prime minister has just set out an ambitious vision for the uk s future relationship with the eu, making clear that both sides will benefit from a new and unique partnership, the government spokesperson said. we have made substantial progress in reducing the deficit while finding extra money for the national health service and social care at the same time. we are not complacent about the challenges ahead but we are optimistic about our bright future, the spokesperson added.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.58666666666667,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
world (or at least brooklyn) stops for lost dog - the new york times,"bailey, a goldendoodle, lived a placid, largely uneventful life on a block of handsome brownstones in carroll gardens, brooklyn, until 7:15 on the morning of oct. 24. that was when her owner leashed her to a metal chair outside henry’s local, a coffee shop on henry street, and went in for an iced latte. another customer entered the cafe. bailey, startled, jumped to the side. the chair crashed to the sidewalk. the noise spooked bailey further. she bolted — down henry street, dragging the clattering chair behind her, with her owner, orna le pape, in pursuit, yelling: “bailey, stop! no! no!” bailey ran diagonally through the intersection at carroll street. then the chair snagged on something. bailey broke free, leaving the chair and her leash and id tags behind. she turned right at the when in rome hair salon onto her block, president street. she ran right past her house, and she kept going. ms. le pape, 47 and fit but no match for a sprinting dog, lost sight of bailey at the next corner, but yelled directions: “she went that way!” bailey went left and left again, toward the waterfront. when ms. le pape got to columbia street, on the far side of the expressway, no one was on the street. she screamed bailey’s name. she guessed at a direction to run. she passed people. no one had seen her. gone. every week, dozens of dogs and cats go missing in new york city. their distraught owners put up signs. some turn up alive. some do not. over the next few days, bailey somehow became a phenomenon, a cause, and in her rarefied corner of brooklyn and beyond, a social media star. now it was around 7:30 on a monday, a school and work day, though ms. le pape, a psychotherapist, had no patients scheduled until evening. she ran home, got her car and began an aimless, frantic drive in search of the dog. she called home and told her son to find photos of bailey (a dog with a shaggy coat, a chestnut beard and enormously long eyelashes) and start printing out fliers. she drove home, picked them up, walked to a nearby copy shop to make more and started posting them, crying all the while. ms. le pape canceled sessions with her evening patients, citing a family emergency. all day, she wandered the tidy precincts known collectively as brownstone brooklyn. up columbia to atlantic avenue, down hicks street by the expressway, west to the factories and warehouses of red hook, swinging by the dog run beneath by the highway overpass. everywhere ms. le pape went, people seemed compelled to help. they asked for an extra flier so they could post it on facebook, or make copies and tape them up elsewhere. they offered suggestions — call vets, call shelters, call animal rescue places, go to the police. “i went to the sanitation garage, down by the water, and the guy said, ‘i’m announcing this on roll call until they find her,’” ms. le pape said. “i ran into absolute strangers who said they were going to church to pray for my dog. ” ms. le pape spared no expense. for $149. 95 she registered with lostmydoggie. com, which 1, 250 of her neighbors, alerting them to look out for bailey. she printed over a thousand fliers. omar at the copy shop would not take her money. in the evening, ms. le pape became fixated on brooklyn bridge park, a mile and a half north of her house — a quiet place to hide for a dog who hates loud noises. from 11:30 p. m. to 1:30 a. m. ms. le pape and her mother, who had come out from manhattan to help, wandered the deserted park, calling the dog’s name. nothing. tuesday: day 2. ms. le pape started getting calls from people who said they had seen bailey the day before. she was able to reconstruct some of bailey’s route: 7:30 a. m. on monday near the brooklyn bridge, a mile and a half north of her house. then a mile and a half southeast of the bridge at nevins and degraw streets. at 10:30 p. m. on monday, bailey had been spotted on henry street, five blocks from her house, but running the wrong way. that first day she covered at least 4 miles, probably considerably more. ms. le pape went to the city pet shelters in east harlem and east new york, brooklyn. nothing. more acts of kindness. near the fairway supermarket in red hook a man flagged her down. “he said, ‘i see you’re offering a reward on your sign. i have the winery that’s down here — tell people the reward is they can come for a tasting and a tour. ’” it is not clear why the search for bailey drew such an outpouring of support. part of it may be that carroll gardens retains an intimate feel. it certainly did not hurt that she was a particularly appealing dog. “i don’t know if the entire neighborhood would mobilize for an dog,” ms. le pape said. a cynic might wonder if class had anything to do with it. a friend of ms. le pape’s had another theory. “she said, ‘at a time like this, when there’s so much turmoil going on around the election, here’s this story that everyone can latch on to and be on the same side. everyone wants a lost dog found. ’” in the late afternoon, ms. le pape’s mother noticed signs for a beagle named edie, who lived three blocks from bailey and had also run off while leashed to a chair on the same day as bailey. “i thought it would be a great idea to join forces,” she said. she called one of edie’s owners, olly smith. “i can’t talk right now,” he said. “i think we’ve just found our little dog’s body. ” edie had been hit by a car on the expressway. at 4:30 a. m. on wednesday, ms. le pape was awakened by a dream: bailey is downstairs, go downstairs. “i didn’t listen to the voice because it was crazy. ” in the morning, ms. le pape went on facebook. under “trending” (a list based on her location, her own social network and broader algorithms) the top topic was bailey. outside, she found dog poop on the sidewalk in front of the house. it appeared to be a few hours old. it looked like bailey’s. “i thought, ‘what if i pick it up and took it to the vet and had them analyze it? ’” ms. le pape recalled. “i was reaching for anything. ” ms. le pape canceled her wednesday appointments to continue the search. “we heard you have to do at least a radius,” she said. in her part of brooklyn, there are something like 1, 500 blocks within a radius. at 10 p. m. on wednesday evening, more than 60 hours after bailey dashed off, ms. le pape was riding a bike two neighborhoods from home, calling bailey’s name, and her phone rang. “this woman is panting and puffing,” she recounted. “she says, ‘i’m following your dog, trying to stay with her. ’” bailey was on sackett street, just a few blocks from home. ms. le pape flew down columbia street. she ran into the woman: “she said, ‘i was trying to call you again — we lost her. ’” the phone rang again. someone had just seen bailey in red hook, on van brunt street. and again: “i see your dog,” a man told her. bailey was on degraw street, heading in the direction of home. ms. le pape called her mother. “i just sort of screamed something to the effect of, ‘everyone get downstairs! ’” ms. le pape’s older son opened the door. there was bailey, at the top of the stoop. she was starving and dehydrated. she had lost eight pounds. her paw was bleeding. but she was intact. ms. le pape and her mother began to notify everyone who had been helping with the search, including edie’s grieving owner, olly smith. “this is the most wonderful news,” he wrote back. “we’re so, so happy for you all. ” bailey has resumed her old life, with one notable change: the coffee place. “i still go there every day,” ms. le pape said. “but without her. ”",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,2.187692307692309,5.2,0.07142857142857142,0.0

religion & politics: a bad mix,"october sky, good harbor beach ma(image by richard turcotte) license dmca religion is what gives people hope in a world torn apart by religion - jon stewart our constitution granted each and every one of us the freedom to believe or not believe as we decide. that protection applies to all of us, and when one group has decreed by some spiritual osmosis that their version of the unverifiable and occasionally insane has been decreed as the new law, then it is up to the rest of us to put that crazy back where it belongs: away from public influence. it's done enough damage as it is. mankind offers a long history of reliance on others by religious believers with the former being no more intelligent or enlightened than the average man/woman on the street (often far less, if history--or current events--is our guide). personal thought and introspection have accordingly been relinquished--then, and certainly now. those presumably more enlightened individuals [bear with me] in turn define and explain their versions of truths, beliefs, and obligations--all in the context of a judging, to-be-feared-and-obeyed, person-like entity. no small measure of self-interest factors in to their assessments. keeping ardent followers sufficiently agitated about some loving deity's wrath [an oxymoron on a grand scale!] allows those professing a direct phone line to the one and only all the time and opportunity they need to preserve their political and economic advantages without so much as a peep from those loyal supplicants. hell of a racket.... the current crop of its spokespeople earn kudos for the ways in which they have fashioned very creative takes on what they claim to be the one and only word. perhaps it's time that we all recognize and simply accept [assuming we accept any kind of theology to begin with] that one religious conviction is in fact no more rational--or irrational--than another. with so many contradictory beliefs, either there is some other unifying and overarching principle, or we will continue to sabotage ourselves and the future of generations to follow by fighting to assert we're right and everyone else is wrong. we own that choice. by its very nature the source of our universe is unfathomable. we simply do not have the means or capabilities to define with certainty that great mystery--try as we do. so instead, a great many among us have fashioned a notion that some human-like-but-slightly-better-and-bigger-person-like god/allah/whatever created all. furthermore--apparently--only some know just what it wants from us. that is so convenient, isn't it! - advertisement - that also frees up some thinking time on the part of those same loyal followers. why think if someone else is willing to do all of that hard work for us, right? aside from that perk, this ceding of rational contemplation is a problem. always has been. it will continue to be. for all of us, that must change. acquiescence--or silence--each carry consequences. were they limited to those followers disinclined to ponder their marching orders, we would certainly have at least one less set of concerns on our plates. if only.... any honest reading of american history does not suggest a christian nation that has had secularism forced on it in recent years by liberal forces, but the opposite. ours is a country that has always been basically secular but has always had to contend with a loud-mouthed minority of theocrats who periodically succeed at using government to push religion until the forces of secularism beat them back again. it's obvious why conservative christians would like to believe otherwise. believing they're an oppressed group being denied their birthright is a lot more fun than accepting that they are an oppressive group trying to steal basic freedoms from everyone else. ignorance, narrow-mindedness, self-serving behaviors, paranoia, fears, and the full range of irrational, fact-challenged nonsense do not manifest themselves inside a protective bubble. the more we collectively permit the subtle infiltration of curiously hypocritical mandates into policy-making, the more certain we can be that outcomes will benefit only very few. basic math skills tell us that when only a few ""win,"" most lose. that's not a good place for us to be. - advertisement - adapted from a blog post of mine view ratings | rate it http://richardturcotte.com/ looking left and right: inspiring different ideas, envisioning better tomorrows rich turcotte is a retired attorney, former financial advisor, and now a writer. the mission: informing others about the significance and impact of peak ( more... )",1,6,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.600000000000001,18.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0

"what happens to our lungs, brain & mood when we use a himalayan salt lamps","keywords: cancer , diet , health , health benefits of himalayan salt lamp , mental health , natural remedies , stress , toxins the himalayan salt lamps are made from natural himalayan crystal salt rock formed millions of years ago in the foothills of himalaya. salt lamps are blocks of pure himalayan salt, so they come from the same region of the world. also known as the ‘vitamins of the air’, they are made from the salt that came from ancient oceans, and serve as a perfect air ionizer. how himalayan salt lamps work? himalayan salt lamps emit negative ions in the air which are healthy for the human body. the ionization is supported by the bulb inside of the salt block since the bulb heats the salt block around it. himalayan salt attracts the water around it and this process called as hygroscopic. therefore, the himalayan salt lamps may become dump or wet, especially in an environment with high humidity. as the bulb heats the salt lamp, the water evaporates and the negative ions are released in the air. the negative ions bind with the positive harmful ions such as allergens, molds and bacteria, and neutralize the environment in the house. improve blood flow particular studies have suggested that negative ions, such as those emitted by himalayan salt lamps, can accelerate blood flow. this boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs. purify air dust, pollen, cigarette smoke and other pollutants ruin the purity of the air we breathe, and the perfect way to neutralize it is to use himalayan salt lamp on your room. it acts as air purifier through its ability to absorb water and evaporating them after. they attract water molecules in the air, which traps impurities in the air and leaves you with fresh, clean air: this is known as hygroscopy. good vibrations salt has been used through out the ages to clean energies from homes and people. you can use salt to clear crystals, clear your body and clear your home. because salt crystals vibrate at a frequency closer to the earths magnetic frequency known as the shuman resonance frequency they can also help bring us back in balance. boost energy levels positive ions deplete the body of energy, and it is believed that himalayan salt lamps can actually do the opposite. the negative ions increase energy levels, which yields a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature. improve your breathing asthma and other breathing complications can be triggered by polluted, corrupted air. salt lamps ensure that you breathe cleaner air whenever you are around them, helping to improve breathing and prevent contaminants from entering your lungs. other benefits of using himalayan salt lamp balancing ph to strengthening bones and lowering blood pressure reduce morning sickness, some type of depression reduce asthma attack and allergy symptoms reduce allergic reaction",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.125,5.884285714285717,8.457142857142857,0.0,0.0

soon-to-go-free jail convicts snared in french attack plot probe,"paris (reuters) - two french prison inmates who were soon to be freed have been placed under investigation on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack and communicating by smartphone with syria, stronghold of islamic state militants. the news highlighted the risk, regularly flagged by rights groups and jail authorities, that crowded prisons offer fertile ground for religious radicalization and conversion to the cause of islamist fighters, not only in france. it also prompted calls for a crackdown on use of smartphones inside prisons. the two, who were nearing the end of jail time for hold-ups and other criminal activity but not terrorist offences, were taken from their cells late last week and interrogated for four days before being placed formally under investigation for suspected terrorist activity, a judiciary official said. one element that prompted the authorities to act was the interception of encrypted message traffic with syria, a fresnes prison staff representative, cedric boyer, said. the precise nature of what was being planned was not clear, he added. conveying the seriousness of the perceived threat that the two constituted, justice minister nicole belloubet told europe 1 radio: what happened yesterday exposed the urgency of the situation. french tv station lci said the two were plotting attacks against jail wardens and police forces, while a source close to the investigation said they also had other targets planned. more than 240 people have been killed in france in attacks since the start of 2015 by assailants who pledged allegiance to, or were inspired by, islamic state. france has a long record of radicalization in its prisons. prison guards said the ease with which smartphones can be used to communicate secretively with the world outside was an increasing problem. the government is going to have to put its hand in its pocket, said boyer, a representative of the force ouvriere labor union and guards at the fresnes prison. extra staffing is needed but it s also a matter of keeping up with technology, being able to scramble 4g communications rather than staying stuck in the age of the nokia 33-10, boyer told bfm tv, referring to latest technology and the days when mobile phones were a rudimentary novelty.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.964444444444446,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0

maine gop state senator sick of his bullsh*t demands censure of governor paul lepage,"republicans in maine tolerated governor paul lepage and his offensive words and actions for a long time, but now they are finally sick of him.lepage has constantly characterized blacks and hispanics as drug-dealers and the enemy but it was a voicemail message he left for democratic state rep. drew gattine that finally caused republicans to say enough is enough. i would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker, lepage said. i want to talk to you. i want you to prove that i m a racist. i ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. you i need you to, just friggin i want you to record this and make it public because i am after you. thank you. clearly, lepage lost his sh*t in this message and actually threatened a member of the state legislature.that s a line too far, says republican state senator amy volk.volk is so disgusted with lepage that she is seeking a censure, which is a formal resolution expressing severe disapproval that will be on the record. up until this point, i have refrained from publicly criticizing any of the governor s behavior both out of respect for the office and a desire to preserve a working relationship with him and his staff, volk explained. but this latest and the unwelcome attention it has brought to our state is a bridge too far. my understanding is that it would be by a vote of the legislature that it s sort of an official reprimand entered into the record so you know some sort of displeasure with the governor s behavior, she added.a censure is a pretty big deal, especially when it s being called for by a member of the governor s own party.frankly, lepage should have been censured and impeached a long time ago.after all, his outbursts and damaging decisions have embarrassed the state so much that maine s largest newspaper actually apologized to the nation for him ever being elected to begin with. dear america: maine here, the portland press herald began: please forgive us we made a terrible mistake. we managed to elect and re-elect a governor who is unfit for high office. he has a gruff exterior and blunt way of talking that some of us find refreshing, but he has shown again and again that he governs by grudge, and uses his power to beat up on people who cannot fight back. unfortunately for maine, unless republicans grow a spine and impeach their inflammatory governor they will be stuck with him until 2019, giving him plenty of time to humiliate himself and the state even more than he has already.featured image via flickr",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.07142857142857142,8.412857142857145,11.314285714285715,0.07142857142857142,0.0
3 ways to find focus in trump's age of distractions · guardian liberty voice,"president-elect donald trump is like a one-man meteor shower of this age. he sprays white-knuckle antipathy upon all manner of people of varied religions, ethnicities, race, and any other target of choice. he avoids the “politically correct” avenue and simply does things his own way. trump’s age of distractions has thrown the country into a frenzy leaving people careening and disoriented. the real issue is the lack of focus is not limited to the realm of politics; it has shifted into other areas that have affected many on a personal level. this is not really about the distraction of politics, it is more centered on the politics of distraction. one of the things that continues to rise over the past 15 years or so is the increase in diagnosis involving focus. whether it is adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) or ocd (obsessive-compulsive disorder), the list of diagnosis that indicates a challenge in our ability to focus has america in the lead above any other country. the blame has shifted from the school system to the household, to the programmers of major television stations and now, trump’s age of distractions. famed novelist arthur golden said, “a mind troubled by doubts cannot focus on the course of victory.” with this in mind, it is evident that no matter who is to blame for the lack of focus, victims need to discover a remedy fast. focus, by definition, is the adjustment for distinct vision; a center of activity, attraction, and attention. it is the last part of the definition that really stands out, “the center of a person’s activity, attraction, and attention . ” here is the real deal, people do not possess focus if it has not arrested those three areas of life. that is the difference between hobbies and passions. the latter captivates all you are and all you do. many have failed simply because they have refused to bring their lives into a definite focus. focus allows us to harness our skills, intelligence, and resources and put them to work on our life goals. most, at one time or another, have fallen into the trap of being a “jack of all trades.” the part that is often missed is that we become masters of none. we spread ourselves thin in an effort to appear busy, but life’s successes come from a laser beam approach toward tasks. this may be the reason america ranks nearly last amidst other countries with regards to productivity. we have more stuff than ever, but we seem to be doing less. the issue lies in our inability to focus. where do we begin? in a society that is screaming at us from sun up to sun down, how will we find the time to focus? even on our jobs, we get assigned to one project only to be told the other five are really the priority. everything was due two days ago. people consume fast food at alarming rates because it is supposed to be fast and no one has time to cook a balanced meal. this, however, leads to fears of illnesses like cancer and diabetes. people of all nationalities seem to be in a losing battle with the clock and now experts are telling saying the biggest problem is really the lack of focus. listed below are solutions that can ease the pressure and help people to find focus in trump’s age of distractions: admit other things are important too: one of the first mistakes we make is trying to go “cold turkey” when it comes to our distractions. you have had them long enough for them to become a new normal. therefore, cutting them out will not be easy. first, devise a plan to lower a number of distractions by setting guidelines. by checking emails less frequently and turning the ringer off on your phone, you increase your ability to focus instantly. solicit the help of colleagues: people tend to interrupt you because that is what you have trained them to do. setting boundaries around yourself sends an instant message to people indicating you are in work mode. let them know your times of “on purpose” focus and that you are not to be disturbed. usually, people will honor it. utilize technology, sticky notes, and lists to your advantage: in your lap right now is the power to retake your focus. you probably have a smartphone, tablet, kindle or some other device capable of helping you organize your time. i find if we do not have a plan, we are planning to fail. set reminders to study in your phone, read your morning paper on your ipad while commuting, or set a to-do list the night before. all these small tasks add up to big time savers in the future. in trump’s age of distraction, it has become easy to blame the lack of focus on external events. in reality, the only thing we really do control is our behavior in any given situation. take back your life and readjust your focal point. you will be amazed at how closely life imitates a camera. until it is turned on and focused, no memories are ever clearly captured. remember, this is really not about the distraction of politics, but the responsibility of managing the politics of distraction. opinion by cherese jackson (virginia) source: new york times: the politics of distraction photo credits: top image courtesy of michael vadon- flickr license inline image courtesy of aaron brinker – flickr license featured image courtesy of nate steiner – flickr license donald trump , election , focus , self help",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.633846153846157,11.353846153846156,0.0,0.0
racists spew hate all over facebook after black people hold anti-violence #bikesupgunsdown rally (video),"when the black lives matter movement started gaining nationwide attention, racists across america were outraged. how dare the african-american community speak out against the institutionalized racism in this country! one of the most common statements from the hate-filled folks was, oh sure, they complain about white on black crime, but ignore black on black crime! and that sentiment is what makes the following story so ironic.on monday, a group of predominantly black bikers held a rally called bikes up, guns down. hundreds of young men took to the streets on their atv s and dirt bikes to promote peace in their communities. rapper project stacks, who is involved in the movement, explained what it was all about in an interview with the miami new times in april:bikes up, guns down is strictly to stop the youth violence. violence ain t cool. we re saying, let s stick together. we already deep in population. back then, when it was violence, it was probably one person droppin every three months or every six months. now you got two or three dropping every weekend. or two, three, or four dead bodies every weekend so it s kind of different, and it done raise the stakes. but i know they like to ride them bikes. give em something to do. i ma buy as many bikes as i can, man.however, when dozens of riders took to the streets on martin luther king, jr. day, the white supremacists went wild on facebook. fox 13 tampa bay posted a video of the riders on the streets, some of them were driving like idiots, but for the most part is was just a bunch of bike riders but the white folks were very displeased with this. that s right, calling out his vile stereotypes makes you the racist.the sad thing about this entire incident was the completely predictable way that the racists responded. the people who participated in the rally were branded thugs even when they were trying to do something positive for their community. yet, the same totally inclusive white people have nothing to say when hundreds of caucasian bikers hold rallies and disrupt traffic. hell, they didn t even say anything when a bunch of bikers got into a gun fight outside of a restaurant.as a person who is so white i can guide the way in a dark tunnel, i am truly disgusted by the way my community continues to treat other people. it s not that difficult to be a good human being, i promise.if you are one of those people who still believes that we live in a post-racial america, all you have to do is log on to the internet to be proven wrong.watch:featured image video screenshot",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.312857142857148,14.171428571428573,0.07142857142857142,0.0

will james comey change the outcome of the election?,"will james comey change the outcome of the election? is this the game-changing october surprise that many hope for -- and others dread? november 2, 2016 bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center. fbi director james comey’s reopening of the investigation into clinton’s emails has roiled once more the presidential election. donald trump has called the decision “courageous” and “bigger than watergate.” clinton, the doj, democrat senators, and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champion’s defection, calling the announcement “appalling,” “absurd,” “strange,” “deeply troubling,” an “attack,” and “unprecedented.” the bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to trump’s side and put him in the white house. there’s no doubt that comey’s announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying. not because it is “unprecedented” as the democrats keep squealing. they had no such qualms when the weekend before the 1992 election, special prosecutor lawrence walsh indicted a poll-surging george h.w. bush for his alleged involvement in the iran-contra scandal. no, the mystery is comey’s motives. is comey like conrad’s lord jim, now sacrificing his fbi career––sure to be over if the notoriously vengeful clinton is elected–– to atone for having besmirched his office, reputation, and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist self-interest? or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled fbi investigators? to quote one of our candidates, “at this point, what difference does it make?” the real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters. right now we don’t know if the content of the 650,000 emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter anthony weiner, estranged husband of clinton vizier huma abedin, will reveal something damning like, say, classified materials. but we already know that clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server, which didn’t bother comey back in july. so what could be in these new emails that rises above comey’s sophistic “extreme carelessness,” and reaches the statute’s “gross negligence”? or has comey found new evidence of hillary’s “intent,” his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law? there had to be something that made comey subject himself to the scorched-earth wrath of the democrats. whatever is found on the abedin laptop, one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters. they have shrugged off so many scandals, lies, and failures that should have sunk a candidacy, that it’s hard to calculate what level of incompetence, unpleasantness, dishonesty, sleaze, and crime is disqualifying anymore. here are the greatest hits from hillary’s catalogue: whitewater missing billing records from her tenure at the rose law firm renting out the lincoln bedroom to donors travelgate illegal possession of fbi files conducting illegal secret meetings of the task force on national health care reform cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail hounding the victims of her husband’s sexual assaults and philandering stealing $200,000 worth of china, furniture, and artwork from the white house claiming she landed under “sniper fire” in bosnia claiming she and bill left the white house “dead broke” shaking down wall street while assuring the orcs of capitalism that she’s got their back charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides calling 30,000 missing emails “personal” communications lying about the benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead americans’ families supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure internet video when she knew the same night that they weren’t perjuring herself before congress and the fbi about the emails and her private server the disastrous overthrow of ghaddafi in libya the disastrous “reset” with russia the disastrous nuclear deal with iran the disastrous withdrawal from iraq the corrupt clinton foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary, the pay-to-play state department using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planet’s most brutally misogynistic regimes serially flip-flopping on issues like same-sex marriage, the trans pacific trade deal, and the keystone pipeline promising to “raise taxes on the middle class” and “put coal miners out of work” her campaign staff’s dirty tricks against trump and his supporters her campaign staff’s incestuous relationship with the media her staff’s illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation her strong support of gruesome late-term abortions and, last but not least, the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health back in the day, just a few of these gaffes, deceptions, and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for congress, let alone the white house. and mr. trump’s offenses? he’s talks exactly as you’d expect a new york real estate developer, casino owner, reality television star, and beauty pageant mogul to talk he’s condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what bill clinton and every white-house-visiting rapper, movie star, or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity: “when you’re a star they let you do it,” as trump bragged of his crude sexual advances he’s ignorant of policy he doesn’t understand the economics of global trade he doesn’t know what the “nuclear triad” is he’s addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives he wants to build a wall with mexico he takes legal advantage of tax law he’s not “suitable” for office he does not have the right “temperament” he’s used bankruptcy as a business tool he’s accused of groping over a dozen women, including a polymorphously perverse porn star he’s mean and insulting he has orange hair in short, trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices. just ask hillary’s various secret service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be. the voters will decide for themselves which candidate’s catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous. but whatever happens, it’s clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates. this transformation happened decades before trump and hillary came along. after bill clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the white house, his approval ratings were 73%. he left the white house with a 66% rating, higher than any president since harry truman, including ronald reagan. think about it: the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the soviet union into its own dustbin of history. that was the inflection point for our political culture. no wonder that barack obama’s lack of any real-world experience or achievement, left-wing views, self-confessed drug use, friends like the anti-american racist jeremiah wright and unrepentant terrorist bill ayers, and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to 45 million voters. so why now are we shocked, shocked that off-brand candidates like hillary clinton and donald trump are vying for the presidency? decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue, wisdom, and decorum have already long gone. so absent a smoking howitzer in the next wikileaks dump, comey’s restart of the investigation, which in any case will take months to complete, will probably not be the game-changing october surprise many hope for and others dread, especially given a corrupt media’s studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate. then again, the rapid erosion of hillary’s support is drawing analogies to reagan’s late surge against carter. either way, on november 8, most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions, and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like “cares for people like me.” or they might just finally realize that hillary’s accumulated offenses are intolerable. but what that standard of selection will deliver is anybody’s guess.",1,9,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,3.653333333333336,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
"sanders, trump give union hope in fight for carrier jobs","indianapolis (reuters) - duane oreskowic was speechless when he learned last week that his job would be one of 1,400 lost when his employer, carrier corp, moved production to mexico. but he has found his voice again since learning that bernie sanders is interested in his plight. “i am a big-time sanders fan and i hope he can help us,” said the 37-year-old assembly specialist. “but even if he can’t, maybe we can stop this happening to other american workers.” the feb. 9 announcement by united technologies corp’s carrier unit that it would shift production to mexico from indianapolis has thrust the long-term trend of u.s. manufacturing job decline to the foreground of the nation’s election year agenda. republican presidential front-runner donald trump seized on the announcement to amplify his position that companies such as carrier should be taxed if they send jobs to low wage countries. democratic candidate sanders called carrier, a maker of air conditioners, an “example of how nafta and other trade policies have been a disaster for american workers.” the 2016 u.s. presidential election is in november. communities around indianapolis have witnessed a steady outflow of factory jobs over the past two decades. what made this action different was a youtube video of the workers getting the news that by thursday afternoon had more than 3.4 million views, and the political reaction to it. “i came here 30 years ago looking for the american dream,” said hatice lancaster, 51, originally from turkey. “maybe i should have gone to mexico instead.” chuck jones, president of united steelworkers local 1999, which represents the carrier workers, said he hopes to use the attention to force carrier to reverse its decision. jones faces a steep climb. carrier has told the union it can pay mexican workers $3 an hour versus more than $20 on average in indianapolis. a spokeswoman for carrier said the company pays a “competitive wage” based on local conditions and could not discuss pay levels. since 1998, the chain-smoking, plain-spoken and profane jones has watched the number of factories represented by his local dwindle to 12 from 38. he and his staff can rattle off the names of plants that have closed. “we didn’t ask for this fight,” jones said. “but we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere.” jones is now giving interviews to anyone who asks - he was interrupted by multiple phone calls seeking comment while talking to reuters - in the hope “this time america will pay attention and do something about rampant corporate greed.” jones is grateful that trump has drawn public attention to carrier, but he sees sanders “as a champion for our cause.” jones said he has been contacted by the sanders campaign. a member of the sanders campaign said the vermont senator’s team would be in touch with jones. some carrier workers interviewed outside the plant said they are drawn to trump. brian easton, 45, said he and his wife work for carrier, and are now coming to terms with what he said is likely to be a permanent drop in their living standard. “this country is run by corporate america and we need someone in office like donald trump who is not beholden to anyone,” easton said. “i don’t think he can save our jobs, but if we draw attention to this perhaps other workers won’t have to go through this.”",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.830000000000002,8.0,0.1,0.1
"as trump visits u.n., new york prepares for 'super bowl' of security","new york (reuters) - new york police and a host of federal agencies are preparing for the annual traffic and security nightmare known as the united nations general assembly, featuring a week of speeches by u.s. president donald trump and a parade of other dignitaries. the meeting of the world’s top leaders and diplomats, scheduled to begin on tuesday, will bring street closures, thousands of police officers and hundreds of protesters to midtown manhattan, an area already plagued with gridlock on an average weekday. “it’s the equivalent of the super bowl of security,” said j. peter donald, a spokesman for the new york city police department. trump will be on hand on monday and tuesday, when he will address the body of world leaders for the first time. it was not immediately clear whether he would stay at his manhattan penthouse about a mile away from united nations headquarters or sleep at his golf course in bedminster, new jersey. the event also comes just days after a homemade bomb on a packed commuter train in london injured 22 people, though it failed to fully explode. a handful of anti-trump protests in new york have been scheduled, with more sure to come. a march on monday to combat “white supremacy” will start from grand central terminal, while the left-wing activist group code pink has organized a tuesday march to the u.n. to protest trump and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. other protesters will gather outside the u.n. to call out specific countries, including a rally against iran president hassan rouhani. the nypd’s elite counterterrorism unit, along with detectives from the intelligence bureau and officers from the aviation, harbor, highway and traffic units, will be on hand throughout the week. donald said the department has plenty of “muscle memory” from previous years. “it’s a full assortment of personnel from nearly every part of the police department,” donald said. “we’ll be prepared for anything. we’ll have backup plans and backup plans for the backup plans.” the u.s. secret service, the fbi, the department of homeland security and various other federal agencies are also involved in providing security during both trump’s visit and the general assembly. vast swaths of the area near the united nations, on the far east side of midtown manhattan, will be closed to vehicle traffic, and the coast guard will heavily restrict boat traffic on the east river. police did not immediately offer an estimate on how much the week’s security and traffic measures would cost.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.450000000000003,5.733333333333334,0.0,0.0

why libertarians (and other 3rd parties) should thank donald trump,"with just three months to go before the long national nightmare that is election 2016 transmogrifies into a either a hillary clinton or a donald trump presidency(!), let's take a late-summer moment to squeeze some lemonade from lemons. whatever happens in november, all of us who have political perspectives that are routinely discounted or dismissed by the republican-democratic duopoly should thank donald trump for creating a blueprint to power for us. pull yourself out of the news cycle that he has been so expert in dominating with a daily—sometimes hourly—spew of sensational utterings, proclamations, and half-baked policy plans: extreme vetting! mexican rapists! crooked hillary! when he's not creating outrage himself, he brings it in other people, such as when his supporters get egged at rallies or unflattering naked statues of the billionaire crop up in cities around the country. the simple fact is, as conservative commentator and finding mr. righteous author lisa de pasquale, writes, there has been much hand-wringing among the right on where republicans go now that trump has ""destroyed"" the party. they complain that the republican party has left them, while millions of trump voters and libertarians believe party leaders and professional pundits left them decades ago. regardless of whether the #nevertrump crowd has valid points, it is clear that trump has done libertarians a favor in busting the old guard of republican kingmakers. the old guard isn't mad that trump doesn't represent their principles, but that they no longer hold any power in picking the top of the ticket. the proof is that rather than get behind gary johnson, they'd rather trot out a candidate with zero name recognition or campaign infrastructure. beyond revealing the emptiness of the power bases in the existing republican party (and party members' absolute lack of interest in moving toward their ostensible principles of limited, smaller government), de pasquale argues that trump is the shape of better things to come: the trump campaign has been a battering ram for libertarians. in just over a year, trump has succeeded in what the libertarian party hasn't been able to do in the 35 years since it was conceived. not only has he upset traditional party politics, but he's also paved the way for non-traditional candidates. who needs stuffy party leaders and pundits when you have social media and 100% name recognition?... in the current political climate, personality, authenticity, and even celebrity reign. trump has shown that at least in the primaries, the absence of a traditional ground game and campaign budget can be overcome. libertarians have an advantage because we already know they're authentic by going against the dominant parties.... libertarians also have a good celebrity bench that could help them replicate the trump campaign. i wouldn't necessarily endorse famous libertarian vince vaughn for president (though i would endorse myself as first lady), but i would enthusiastically get on the peter thiel train. set aside policy disagreements libertarians have with trump. they should be thankful that trump has created a new path for national office. he built libertarian candidates a path to success and he paid for it. read the whole piece and start thinking: who are the agents of libertarian influence that can either transform the existing major parties and bring a bold new ""free minds and free markets"" sensibility to independent runs at all levels of government? better yet, who are the crossover figures that might do for the libertarian party what athletes such as joe namath did for the old afl by legitimizing an upstart league as a major force? it's a given that americans know nothing and care even less about history. that's certainly true when it comes to journalism generally and political journalism specifically. did you ever wonder just why every election is the most important one in our lives? the answer is only mysterious to dead-enders within those group and to journalists, both of whom have no sense of history and really think that everything is on the line every four years and that whatever happened 10, 20, or 30 years ago is irrelevant to understanding the current moment. for the most part, we have simply been repeating the same play over and over again, but to less-and-less-engaged audiences. as matt welch and i wrote in the declaration of independents: how libertarian politics can fix what's wrong with america, all the trends of the past 40 to 50 years show that americans have weaker and weaker ties to the republican and democratic parties, just as we do with all consumer brands. whatever post-war coalitions those parties once represented no longer exist. everything in american life is vastly different than it was in, say 1964, when the current identities of the gop and democrats were being formed. these parties are designed to groups of people that either no longer exist in the same numbers as they once did (private-sector union members and socially conservative christians, say) or who don't link issues the way they used to (what's the necessary connection between before for marriage equality and higer marginal tax rates?). yet most party leaders and media ignore the at-or-near-historic lows in voter identification with the democrats and republicans. they also act as if the ideologies and policy platforms of parties can't or don't change over time. the result is a conversation about politics that is less and less moored to basic reality. we need a new operating system for politics in the 21st century, but the people most invested in the current one don't want to migrate or upgrade to anything different. we need windows 10, but they're fine sticking with 3.1, thank you very much. trump's rise—and the semi-successful insurgency of bernie sanders, too—puts the lie to the idea that the power structure is capable of maintaining a status quo that serves fewer and fewer people. given his absolute lack of consistent, coherent policies and his radically backward-looking agenda (anti-trade and migration in an increasingly globalized world?!?), he is not the future of anything, but the last gasp of a 20th-century politics that, in one final push, was able to reduce at least one of the major parties to rubble. it's up to those of us who actually want a new operating system for american governance to determine what comes next.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.370000000000001,8.0,0.0,0.0
"in rush to reclaim yemen, exiled leaders risk fracturing it","holed up in saudi arabia, the inner circle of president hadi is rallying tribal leaders to resist houthi rebels who control much of yemen. the risk is that if and when they regain power the central government will emerge with little authority. uber in court: is it a digital service, or an unlicensed taxi company? uber in court: is it a digital service, or an unlicensed taxi company? from the gilded suites and granite lobby of a luxurious five-star hotel here, the remnants of yemen’s embattled government sees a daily lineup of yemeni tribal leaders, western diplomats, and saudi military commanders. over countless cups of bittersweet coffee and dates, and lobster and seafood dinners, yemeni ministers calmly toss out phrases like “national dialogue” and “institution building” as they talk up their postwar political plans. they lack the air of urgency or desperation of a government forced to take refuge with its powerful neighbor. to hear them tell it, they are a government poised to reclaim power from the shiite houthi militia and allied fighters that call the shots in much of their country. but their blueprint for victory may contain the seeds of defeat for a unitary yemeni state. as in libya, the arming of local militia to oust a common enemy could make it even harder to restore central authority in the aftermath of a civil war. over the last two weeks, the un-backed yemeni president abed rabbo mansour hadi has been working feverously to patch together a broad coalition of yemeni tribes backed by arab military intervention against the iranian-allied houthis. the result is a tribal coalition of some 70,000 fighters – and the pledge of a saudi-egyptian expeditionary force. yemeni officials say they are preparing to retake the southern port city of aden “within days,” and thence fight for control over the rest of yemen. “from day one, we have been building a coalition across all segments of yemeni society to return the rule of law,” says yasseen makawi, a close aide to hadi who has led several talks here with yemeni tribal leaders. hadi is currently in riyadh, living under tight security. “we will be in aden soon to start the long fight,” mr. makawi says. so far, the saudi-led bombing campaign hasn’t stopped the advance of the houthis, which are backed by military units loyal to former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh. on thursday, these forces captured ataq, the provincial capital of oil-rich shabwa province, after days of clashes followed by negotiations with local sunni tribes, according to news reports. for hadi’s exiled government, the stakes are high. in order to win over the support of dozens of tribes in south and central yemen, officials have agreed in future to devolve more government powers to the provinces and tribal regions, threatening the unity of a state that was only reunified in 1990. yemeni tribal leaders see the situation as an opportunity to press for greater autonomy – and perhaps independence. “we are all for a democratic yemen with greater powers in the hands of the people,” says abdullah kathiri, head of the largest tribe in hadrawmout, a wealthy province in eastern yemen who speaks openly about independence. “with this understanding, tribes across the country are now willing to rise up.” such ambitions speak to the centrifugal forces being unleashed in yemen. exiled officials concur that by arming and militarizing sunni tribes across the country, they may create a “second libya” where tribal militias roam unchallenged and refuse to answer to a weak central government. “we do not want to place heavy arms into the hands of tribes and have them act outside the army,” says transport minister badr mubarak ba-salma, who has led talks with tribal representatives. “we don’t want to finally rid ourselves of ali abdullah saleh to find ourselves with dozens of more ali abdullah salehs,” mr. ba-salma adds, referring to the longtime ruler who stepped down in 2012. hadi replaced him as president under a saudi-backed transition that began to unravel last year. in private, hadi’s inner circle concedes it may be a drawn-out, year-long war against the better-armed houthi militias and military units loyal to saleh, which swiftly descended from their stronghold in the northern provinces of saada and amran to claim over 80 percent of yemen’s territory. the houthis boast a fighting force of between 80,000 and 100,000, while forces loyal to saleh number around 20,000, yemeni government officials and observers say. the houthi-saleh fighters boast superior firepower due to the fact that saleh’s supporters include entire military units with fierce allegiances to their political and financial backer. some of this equipment is a legacy of us military aid to yemen during saleh’s rule, which continued under hadi’s government. the houthis control vital military installations outside sanaa and warehouses of rpgs, tanks, and armor-piercing grenade and rocket launchers. given this superior firepower, the hadi government’s strategy is to overcome the militias with greater manpower and urge tribal and political factions to rise up town by town, village by village against what many yemenis view as houthi “invaders”. six military councils – regional groupings of officers loyal to hadi – have been tasked with coordinating with local tribal militias and the saudi-led aerial campaign. the councils have succeeded in fostering armed uprisings in aden, as well taiz in the oil-rich province of marib. however, due to the disparity in arms and lack of cohesive units, the pro-government militias have failed to even secure aden, where hadi had declared a provisional government after fleeing sanaa. to recapture aden, several hundred egyptian and saudi arabian special forces are preparing to deploy in the port city. with fighting intensifying in aden, saudi and yemeni official sources expect the operation ""within the next week."" however, weary of being dragged into a protracted fight, riyadh and cairo have stopped short of committing ground troops to a wider war across yemen. “we are committed to liberating aden and reinstalling the democratically-elected government, but that is all that is being discussed,” says a saudi military liaison close to the operations. instead, the joint arab force would be used with “surgical precision,” say government insiders, using force only to turn the tide in key battles in southern yemen. the hadi government has also received little commitment from the us and its western allies; officials say they left recent talks sessions with western diplomats “frustrated” and “dismayed.” “they want us to lead the war against terrorism and extremism in yemen, but they are allowing our country to be overrun by terrorist groups,” says a cabinet minister who refused to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. the us has begun conducting aerial refueling of saudi-led coalition warplanes. it has also vowed to speed up delivery of weapons to saudi arabia and other gulf powers. should it regain a foothold in yemen, hadi’s government is bracing for perhaps the largest obstacle in restoring control: the north. despite rounds of marathon talks with northern tribal and political leaders in riyadh, hadi and his team have reportedly failed to find “ready and willing partners” to stand up to saleh and houthi forces on their own home turf. “there are opponents to saleh and the houthis in the north, but they are afraid they are outmatched,” ba-salma says. “only by breaking their military power, will we break the fear and see people in the north willing to stand up.” in return for their participation, northern leaders want guarantees of greater power and influence for their region, which was an independent republic during 1962-90. it received a privileged status and government jobs during saleh’s three decades in power. the government has been non-committal so far on granting greater independence to the north beyond what it agreed in a national dialogue that ended two years ago. but it has agreed to permit it greater autonomy under the federal system. hadi is also trying to peel away saleh loyalists who might defect to the government side in return for an amnesty. as an olive branch, hadi officials have promised not to dissolve military units that defect or to cashier their officers. instead, they say the military must be reconstituted as an internal security service. “we don’t want to make the same mistakes in iraq and turn thousands of yemeni citizens into insurgents,” mr. makawi says. “we are prepared to include the supporters of saleh as an integral part of a stable, federal yemen state.”",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.09090909090909091,7.190000000000001,8.0,0.0,0.0

chicago launches ad campaign to counter trump's immigration efforts,"chicago (reuters) - chicago is starting an advertising campaign to reassure immigrants that they are welcome in the third-largest u.s. city, in a show of defiance to a crackdown by president donald trump on people who have entered the country illegally. mayor rahm emanuel said on monday he was not worried about the “one chicago” campaign upsetting the trump administration. starting this week, signs will appear at more than 200 locations including digital billboards, trains and newspaper racks with photos of chicago immigrants highlighting the diversity of their backgrounds. radio and tv spots will start this week with similar stories. a new website, onechi.org, features links for free legal aid and “know your rights” training.the campaign’s slogan is “three million residents, three million stories, one chicago.” the mayor’s office said the campaign was costing taxpayers nothing. the advertising was designed on a pro-bono basis by the ad agency ogilvy chicago and uses city-owned public-service advertising space. “i’m not worried because we’re not only on firm legal ground but firm moral ground,” emanuel said. “we’re all immigrants and we’re not going to let them divide us and say that person is not allowed here.” trump already has threatened to withhold federal funds from cities such as chicago that offer sanctuary to illegal immigrants who commit no serious crimes. the justice department in april singled out chicago and new york, saying they were “crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime,” even though experts say illegal immigration had little to do with chicago’s spike in murders. last month, a u.s. judge blocked a portion of trump’s executive order that sought to withhold most federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities as part of the administration’s efforts to toughen immigration enforcement. u.s. attorney general jeff sessions issued a memo on monday saying that only department of justice and homeland security grants would be at risk for cities that “willfully refuse” to comply with federal law. sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. emanuel, whose grandparents came to the united states as immigrants from moldova, said the campaign was meant to reassure those feeling frightened about deportation. chicago officials estimates there are about 300,000 undocumented immigrants in the city. “i see it with kids all across chicago – they are nervous about their parents and nervous about their own safety because of the government and the rhetoric,” he said.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.520000000000003,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0

list of comey’s 10 biggest screw ups as fbi director…why his firing was long overdue,"comey will inevitably be remembered for the controversial role he played in the 2016 presidential election, where his agency conducted surveillance of the trump campaign as well as investigated the clinton camp for mishandling classified materials, giving both sides arguments for how the fbi ultimately swayed the vote.but even before the 2016 campaign, the fbi endured a number of humiliations under comey s tenure. most damning were revelations that the fbi was generally aware of almost every terrorist who successfully struck america over the last eight years.1. before he bombed the boston marathon, the fbi interviewed tamerlan tsarnaev but let him go. russia sent the obama administration a second warning, but the fbi opted against investigating him again.2. shortly after the nsa scandal exploded in 2013, the fbi was exposed conducting its own data mining on innocent americans; the agency, bloomberg reported, retains that material for decades (even if no wrongdoing is found).3. the fbi had possession of emails sent by nidal hasan saying he wanted to kill his fellow soldiers to protect the taliban but didn t intervene, leading many critics to argue the tragedy that resulted in the death of 31 americans at fort hood could have been prevented.4. during the obama administration, the fbi claimed that two private jets were being used primarily for counterterrorism, when in fact they were mostly being used for eric holder and robert mueller s business and personal travel.5. when the fbi demanded apple create a backdoor that would allow law enforcement agencies to unlock the cell phones of various suspects, the company refused, sparking a battle between the feds and america s biggest tech company. what makes this incident indicative of comey s questionable management of the agency is that a) the fbi jumped the gun, as they were indeed ultimately able to crack the san bernardino terrorist s phone, and b) almost every other major national security figure sided with apple (from former cia director general petraeus to former cia director james woolsey to former director of the nsa, general michael hayden), warning that such a crack would inevitably wind up in the wrong hands.6. in 2015, the fbi conducted a controversial raid on a texas political meeting, finger printing, photographing, and seizing phones from attendees (some in the group believe in restoring texas as an independent constitutional republic).7. during its investigation into hillary clinton s mishandling of classified material, the fbi made an unusual deal in which clinton aides were both given immunity and allowed to destroy their laptops.8. the father of the radical islamist who detonated a backpack bomb in new york city in 2016 alerted the fbi to his son s radicalization. the fbi, however, cleared ahmad khan rahami after a brief interview.9. the fbi also investigated the terrorist who killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the pulse nightclub in orlando, fla. despite a more than 10-month investigation of omar mateen during which mateen admitting lying to agents the fbi opted against pressing further and closed its case.10. cbs recently reported that when two terrorists sought to kill americans attending the draw muhammad event in garland, texas, the fbi not only had an understanding an attack was coming, but actually had an undercover agent traveling with the islamists, elton simpson and nadir soofi. the fbi has refused to comment on why the agent on the scene did not intervene during the attack.via: grabien",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,9.140000000000004,14.0,0.0,0.0

“rigged to deny trump”: looks like elite trying to steal these states to block electoral path to 270,"tweet home » headlines » world news » “rigged to deny trump”: looks like elite trying to steal these states to block electoral path to 270 there are several states that are being surprisingly maneuvered for her advantage… and if successful, will block trump from even coming close the presidency. from mac slavo, shtfplan : will the 2016 election be rigged? that depends on what the definition of “is” is – and whether or not you count blatant media bias, operatives and instigators, shady quasi-voters, bizarre electronic voting “errors” and a heavy-handed advantage in the electoral college and the shifting demographics of a socialist state that promises much to certain groups. with the gop leadership turning its back on trump, and the democratic machine dedicated solely to providing for her, it will be a difficult win for trump, despite overwhelming enthusiasm at rallies across the entire country and lop-sided pro-trump crowds that literally dwarf pro-hillary gatherings of very few. but as most everyone knows by now, it isn’t the popular vote that counts – but only the delegates awarded state-by-state to the electoral college… and that is a game that hillary’s operatives are very good at playing. daily news brief: the 2016 election is in the process of being stolen with rigged voting machines there are several states – in particular – that are being surprisingly maneuvered for her advantage… and if successful, will block trump from even coming close the presidency. texas could turn “blue” for the first time in 20 years this is the big enchilada, so to speak. for the first time in many decades, texas is in play for hillary and the democrats. texas has been as solidly “red” as any state in the union, but 2016 could be different. with 38 electoral votes, the lone star state is the biggest prize on the map next to california, whose 55 electoral votes have gone to the democrats since before history began. since at least 2008, the dems have been massaging their electioneering strategy to capitalize on shifting demographics – with plenty of hispanics in the next generation of voters. on paper, hillary should be able to play well to hispanics with all the controversy over trump’s immigration stances and talk of a border wall. rumors of illegal immigrants be encouraged to vote could be a crucial factor, with polls in texas close to neck and neck… it could go either way. of course, there is every reason to think that team hillary is not taking any chances. as michael snyder and many others have reported , electronic voting machines have been mysteriously flipping votes for hillary in several counties in texas… and that doesn’t bode well for a massive electoral prize that is within range for her campaign: early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from donald trump to hillary clinton. the odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight republican ticket. if hillary clinton is declared the winner of the state of texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that donald trump should lose that state. i have said that it will be the greatest miracle in u.s. political history if donald trump wins this election, but without the state of texas donald trump has exactly zero chance of winning. at least one county is making an emergency switch to paper ballots after irregularities were found with the electronic machines during early voting. meanwhile, infowars confronted the head of texas’ elections about his decision to violate voter laws and abandon a manual count of a random sampling of 1-3% of votes (which should theoretically reflect the larger voting trend, unless something is fishy). without that count, there is less accountability than ever: this is major issue, and texas isn’t the only state… just the biggest. 2. utah’s independent republican could actually beat trump ok, so utah only has a grand total of 6 electoral college votes… and has never been a decisive swing state in a presidential election. but that is because the state has been so solidly “red.” however, this election is totally different. a little known independent candidate named evan mcmullin has actually taken the lead in several recent polls in utah, and is neck-and-neck with both trump and hillary in several other polls (at or around 30% apiece). libertarian gary johnson is also playing (relatively) well at about 5% – possibly enough to swing further momentum away form trump. but evan mcmullin is the real surprise hit – in a state that is suddenly considered an important battleground in the election. mcmullin is a mormon, which gives him a significant boost. he is officially tied to better for america, which is basically a #nevertrump operation – backed by neocons like william kristol. perhaps unsurprisingly, evan mcmullin has a pretty colorful and telling background : on top of being a former policy director for house republicans, he’s also a former cia operations officer; a member of the elite think tank council on foreign relations (cfr); a former goldman sachs investment banker and a volunteer refugee resettlement officer for the united nations high commissioner for refugees in jordan. wow! i wonder if there could be an agenda there. hillary probably won’t win utah, but trump may not either – and it could make a crucial difference if he is within striking distance of 270 electoral votes. 3. florida is a must win swing state for trump… but current polls show possible hillary win oh boy… florida all over again. with 29 electoral votes, it remains a major contender that is so often on the fence and swinging in the wind. it is considered essential for a trump victory, and indeed for just about any successful republican bid for the presidency. sure, we all know the polls are rigged, and may be oversampling dems to look better for hillary on paper – but nonetheless, that perception drives expectations. if she can create a convincing win there, it could change the course of the election once again. florida has consistently been the closest outcome – in 2008 and 2012 it went blue for obama; in 2000 and 2004 it went red for bush (and not without major controversy and some very shady recounting). her team is pushing heavily for early voting in florida, and so far they claim an early voting advantage. but campaign surrogate roger stone is now reporting that hillary has met secretly with broward county officials in florida, and there is speculation that problems with the voting machines may soon be happening all over again. pay very close to what happens there, because of course, florida could be the deciding state (again). right now polls are within 2 points , currently in favor of trump by a very narrow margin. 4. colorado has known voting fraud issues – with dead people on the voter rolls with 9 electoral votes, colorado is currently swinging “blue” but could go either way. cbs4 and the washington times reported that an investigation was started by colorado’s secretary of state after multiple examples were found of deceased people registered and in the voter rolls: “this is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in chicago, that kind of thing,” mr. maasssaid during a thursday evening broadcast. “tonight, that changes. we did find voter fraud in colorado that essentially waters down your vote.” […] “this is the kind of thing you hear rumored, joked about in chicago, that kind of thing,” mr. maasssaid during a thursday evening broadcast. “tonight, that changes. we did find voter fraud in colorado that essentially waters down your vote.” it’s not clear whether or not colorado could make a difference in the outcome, but the results could prove suspect. 5. hillary is “leading” in these key swing states while trump is expected to win the crucial state of ohio, and also north carolina, hillary is projected to take key states including pennsylvania, colorado, iowa, virginia and arizona. according to the washington post : if clinton can hold virginia, pennsylvania, and colorado, then she only needs one more out of many swing states — new hampshire, nevada, ohio, iowa, north carolina, or florida — barring any surprise trump win in a blue-leaning state like wisconsin. that is currently looking very plausible. while any of these could change in the actual outcome, it shows that hillary has definitely maneuvered to win where it counts – not with the people, but with the electoral college. the details are too numerous to follow here, and anything could happen. 6. you know voter fraud is happening if the media claim it isn’t what should be very telling to everyone is how loudly the major media – in concert – are trying to debunk trump’s claims of voter fraud and insist that all is well when it is quite clear that there are major issues. this is one claim that the system is very afraid of, because quite frankly, they have a great deal to hide. there is more reason than ever for accountability, reporting on any irregularities and an insistence that the will of the people be respected – because the system is desperate to hold onto control at any cost. this entry was posted in world news and tagged donald trump , mac slavo , rigged election , shtfplan , voter

secrets of the us election: assange talks to pilger,"secrets of the us election: assange talks to pilger november 5, 2016 wikileaks founder julian assange denies the russian government was the source of leaked emails about hillary clinton and says her “neo-mccarthy” russia-bashing is just part of a cover-up, in an interview with john pilger. by john pilger this interview was filmed in the embassy of ecuador in london – where julian assange is a political refugee – and broadcast on nov. 5, 2016 john pilger: what’s the significance of the fbi’s intervention in these last days of the u.s. election campaign, in the case against hillary clinton? wikileaks founder julian assange. (photo credit: espen moe) julian assange : if you look at the history of the fbi, it has become effectively america’s political police. the fbi demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the cia [general david petraeus] over classified information given to his mistress. almost no one is untouchable. the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us. but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbi’s investigation, so there’s anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak. we’ve published about 33,000 of clinton’s emails when she was secretary of state. they come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] clinton has kept about half – 30,000 — to herself, and we’ve published about half. then there are the podesta emails we’ve been publishing. [john] podesta is hillary clinton’s primary campaign manager, so there’s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. [these emails are] combined with the cover-up of the hillary clinton emails when she was secretary of state, [which] has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi increases. john pilger: the clinton campaign has said that russia is behind all of this, that russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for wikileaks and its emails. julian assange : the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-mccarthy hysteria: that russia is responsible for everything. hilary clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 had assessed that russia was the source of our publications. that is false; we can say that the russian government is not the source. wikileaks has been publishing for ten years, and in those ten years, we have published ten million documents, several thousand individual publications, several thousand different sources, and we have never got it wrong. john pilger : the emails that give evidence of access for money and how hillary clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. i’m thinking of when the qatari representative was given five minutes with bill clinton for a million dollar cheque. julian assange : and twelve million dollars from morocco … john pilger: twelve million from morocco yeah. julian assange : for hillary clinton to attend [a party]. john pilger: in terms of the foreign policy of the united states, that’s where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of isil, in the middle east. can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of isil, are actually those who have helped create it. speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at carl hayden high school in phoenix, arizona, by gage skidmore) julian assange : there’s an early 2014 email from hillary clinton, not so long after she left the state department, to her campaign manager john podesta that states isil is funded by the governments of saudi arabia and qatar. now this is email in the whole collection, and perhaps because saudi and qatari money is spread all over the clinton foundation. even the u.s. government agrees that some saudi figures have been supporting isil, or isis. but the dodge has always been that, well it’s just some rogue princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. but that email says that no, it is the governments of saudi and qatar that have been funding isis. john pilger: the saudis, the qataris, the moroccans, the bahrainis, particularly the saudis and the qataris, are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hilary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to saudi arabia. julian assange: under hillary clinton, the world’s largest ever arms deal was made with saudi arabia, [worth] more than $80 billion. in fact, during her tenure as secretary of state, total arms exports from the united states in terms of the dollar value, doubled. john pilger : of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation. julian assange : yes. john pilger: that’s extraordinary. julian assange : i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of [the reaction] to their ambitions. she represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. the question is how does hilary clinton fit in this broader network? she’s a centralizing cog. you’ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs and major elements of wall street, and intelligence and people in the state department and the saudis. she’s the centralizer that inter-connects all these different cogs. she’s the smooth central representation of all that, and ‘all that’ is more or less what is in power now in the united states. it’s what we call the establishment or the dc consensus. one of the more significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed and how half the obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from citibank. this is quite amazing. john pilger: didn’t citibank supply a list …. ? julian assange : yes. john pilger: … which turned out to be most of the obama cabinet. julian assange : yes. john pilger: so wall street decides the cabinet of the president of the united states? julian assange: if you were following the obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. julian assange : so i think you can’t properly understand hillary clinton’s foreign policy without understanding saudi arabia. the connections with saudi arabia are so intimate. u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton meets with saudi king abdullah in riyadh on march 30, 2012. [state department photo] john pilger : why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of libya? can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us, told you about what happened there, because libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in syria, the isil jihadism and so on, and it was almost hillary clinton’s invasion. what do the emails tell us about that? julian assange : libya, more than anyone else’s war, was hillary clinton’s war. barak obama initially opposed it. who was the person championing it? hillary clinton. that’s documented throughout her emails. she had put her favored agent, sidney blumenthal, on to that; there’s more than 1,700 emails out of the 33,000 hillary clinton emails that we’ve published, just about libya. it’s not that libya has cheap oil. she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state — something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for president. so in late 2011 there is an internal document called the libya tick tock that was produced for hillary clinton, and it’s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within libya; jihadists moved in, isis moved in, leading to the european refugee and migrant crisis. not only did you have people fleeing libya, people fleeing syria, the destabilization of other african countries as a result of arms flows, but the libyan state itself was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. libya faces along to the mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of africa. so all problems, economic problems and civil war in africa — previously people fleeing those problems didn’t end up in europe because libya policed the mediterranean. that was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by gaddafi: ‘what do these europeans think they’re doing, trying to bomb and destroy the libyan state? there’s going to be floods of migrants out of africa and jihadists into europe,’ and this is exactly what happened. john pilger: you get complaints from people saying, ‘what is wikileaks doing? are they trying to put trump in the white house?’ julian assange: my answer is that trump would not be permitted to win. why do i say that? because he’s had every establishment off side; trump doesn’t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies … big foreign money … are all united behind hillary clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. j ohn pilger : there is the accusation that wikileaks is in league with the russians. some people say, ‘well, why doesn’t wikileaks investigate and publish emails on russia?’ julian assange: we have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to russia. most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia, most of which are critical. our [russia] documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia, which they use our documents to back up. john pilger : do you yourself take a view of the u.s. election? do you have a preference for clinton or trump? donald trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at the arizona state fairgrounds in phoenix, arizona. june 18, 2016. (photo by gage skidmore) julian assange: [let’s talk about] donald trump. what does he represent in the american mind and in the european mind? he represents american white trash, [which hillary clinton called] ‘deplorable and irredeemable’. it means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. because he so clearly — through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies — represents people who are not the middle, not the upper-middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting trump in any way, including any criticism of hillary clinton. if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. john pilger: i’d like to talk about ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and [political asylum] in this embassy in london. now ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we’re doing this interview, in the embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the u.s. election campaign. can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on ecuador’s support for you? julian assange : let’s let go back four years. i made an asylum application to ecuador in this embassy, because of the u.s. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, i was successful in my asylum application. the embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the british government admits to spending more than £12.6 million. they admitted that over a year ago. now there’s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds — so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of london between ecuador, a country of 16 million people, and the united kingdom, and the americans who have been helping on the side. so that was a brave and principled thing for ecuador to do. now we have the u.s. election [campaign], the ecuadorian election is in february next year, and you have the white house feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. wikileaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of ecuador; we publish from france, we publish from, from germany, we publish from the netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on wikileaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. [it means] that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organization; [they] try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the american people and others about an election. ecuadoran president rafael correa. john pilger: tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. julian assange : i would be immediately arrested by the british police and i would then be extradited either immediately or to sweden. in sweden i am not charged, i have already been previously cleared [by the senior stockholm prosecutor eva finne]. we were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the u.s. has requested since at least 2000. so over the last 15 years, every single person the u.s. has tried to extradite from sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won’t happen]. john pilger: people often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. julian assange: look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that they’re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. they adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. so in my situation, frankly, i’m a bit institutionalized — this [the embassy] is the world … it’s visually the world [for me]. john pilger: it’s the world without sunlight, for one thing, isn’t it? julian assange: it’s the world without sunlight, but i haven’t seen sunlight in so long, i don’t remember it. john pilger : yes. julian assange: so, yes, you adapt. the one real irritant is that my young children — they also adapt. they adapt to being without their father. that’s a hard, hard adaption which they didn’t ask for. john pilger: do you worry about them? julian assange : yes, i worry about them; i worry about their mother. john pilger: some people would say, ‘well, why don’t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to sweden?’ julian assange : the u.n. [the united nations working group on arbitrary detention] has looked into this whole situation. they spent 18 months in formal, adversarial litigation. [so it’s] me and the u.n. versus sweden and the u.k. who’s right? the u.n. made a conclusion that i am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the united kingdom and sweden, and that [those countries] must obey. it is an illegal abuse. it is the united nations formally asking, ‘what’s going on here? what is your legal explanation for this? [assange] says that you should recognize his asylum.’ [and here is] sweden formally writing back to the united nations to say, ‘no, we’re not going to [recognize the un ruling],’ so leaving open their ability to extradite. i just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publicly in the press, because it doesn’t suit the western establishment narrative — that yes, the west has political prisoners, it’s a reality, it’s not just me, there’s a bunch of other people as well. the west has political prisoners. of course, no state accepts [that it should call] the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. they don’t call them political prisoners in china, they don’t call them political prisoners in azerbaijan and they don’t call them political prisoners in the united states, u.k. or sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. julian assange : here we have a case, the swedish case, where i have never been charged with a crime, where i have already been cleared [by the stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum. those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? john pilger: yes, it’s different. julian assange : the rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that i have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that i have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. [the rhetoric] is trying to avoid [the truth that] the u.n. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, i am subject to persecution by the united states. john pilger is an australian-british journalist based in london. pilger’s web site is: www.johnpilger.com . to support julian assange, go to: https://justice4assange.com/donate.html",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.2755555555555596,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
"obama helps cuban government, blocks emigration to u.s. - breitbart","outgoing president barack obama is using his power over u. s. immigration rules to help cuba’s dictatorial government shut down emigration from the island’s backward economy. [late thursday, obama cancelled the “ foot” migration policy, which allowed cubans to get a u. s. green card once they were officially “paroled” into the united states. the policy, which was established by president bill clinton in 1995, also forced cubans caught at sea back to the island dictatorship. since 2009, roughly 100, 000 cuban migrants have used the “dry foot” policy to migrate into the united states, although at enormous cost to taxpayers. currently, thousands of cubans are migrating through central america, heading to the california and texas borders in the expectation they’ll get asylum and green cards. clinton’s wet policy narrowed a 1966 law which provided green cards to all escapees from cuba’s regime. many cubans used the policy to migrate into florida and other states during the 1960s and even in the 1980s, when cuba’s leaders sent thousands of criminals to florida, causing a huge drop in wages for unskilled americans in miami. a white house statement said obama’s new ‘ ’ policy will treat migrating cubans like it treats ordinary migrants from mexico and many other countries, only a few of whom are allowed to file for asylum. “by taking this step, we are treating cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries,” said a statement from the white house. “the cuban government has agreed to accept the return of cuban nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea. ” but obama’s policy for cuban migrants is sharply different from his policy towards the people of honduras, guatemala and el salvador. since 2012, obama has used his administrative power to permit at least 350, 000 people from these three countries to cross the u. s. border and then quickly file for file for asylum and work permits, even though they are mostly fleeing for economic reasons. the cost to taxpayers of obama’s help for the unskilled central american adults, youths, and children will exceed $200 billion over the next 75 years, unless most are sent home, according to multiple estimates. obama’s statement sought to justify his shutdown of cuban immigration as a policy, not as a policy intended to drive up americans’ wages by reducing economic competition from unskilled migrants. the united states, a land of immigrants, has been enriched by the contributions of for more than a century. since i took office, we have put the community at the center of our policies. with this change we will continue to welcome cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws. during my administration, we worked to improve the lives of the cuban people — inside of cuba — by providing them with greater access to resources, information and connectivity to the wider world. sustaining that approach is the best way to ensure that cubans can enjoy prosperity, pursue reforms, and determine their own destiny. as i said in havana, the future of cuba should be in the hands of the cuban people. in 2014, obama declared the national socialist government of cuba was a legitimate government, and promised to boost trade with companies in the tropical island prison. “i believe that we can do more to support the cuban people and promote our values through engagement. after all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked. it’s time for a new approach,” obama said in december 2014. to the cuban people, america extends a hand of friendship. some of you have looked to us as a source of hope, and we will continue to shine a light of freedom. others have seen us as a former colonizer intent on controlling your future. josé martí once said, “liberty is the right of every man to be honest. ” today, i am being honest with you. we can never erase the history between us, but we believe that you should be empowered to live with dignity and . cubans have a saying about daily life: “no es facil” — it’s not easy. today, the united states wants to be a partner in making the lives of ordinary cubans a little bit easier, more free, more prosperous. obama’s new decision does not kill off a 1995 agreement, under which the u. s. accepts 20, 000 emigrants each year. advocacy groups praised obama’s new restrictions on cubans seeking to escape the dictatorship. “the obama administration has taken a positive step toward a more sensible cuban immigration policy, one that ends preferential treatment for cubans compared with others who arrive without visas,” said a statement from program director geoffrey thale, at the washington office on latin america. up until now, u. s. policy has permitted cubans who arrive at a u. s. border without a visa to be paroled into the country, and put on a path toward citizenship, an advantage that no other latin americans enjoy, and one that has seemed particularly unfair when children and families fleeing violence in central america are subject to deportation. this change ‘normalizes’ our treatment of cuban immigrants. cubans have been seeking entry into the united states primarily because of economic stagnation at home. the u. s. embargo is one of many factors that has contributed to that stagnation, and so wola and many colleagues have recommended to the administration that it should both end preferential treatment for cubans and increase the number of visas available to cubans who pursue regular immigration routes. the population of cuba is 11. 2 million.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.831111111111113,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0
obama details plans for chicago presidential center,"chicago (reuters) - former u.s. president barack obama on wednesday unveiled design plans for his chicago presidential center, which he hopes will serve as a training site for future generations of leaders. the obama presidential center will be built in the 500-acre (200-hectare) jackson park on chicago’s south side. the park was first developed as the site of the 1893 world’s fair. the development will feature three buildings - a museum, forum and library - forming a campus around a plaza. the museum, the tallest of the three structures, will include public areas, offices and classrooms in addition to exhibition space, the obama foundation said in a statement. “what we want this to be is the world’s premier institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world. that is our goal,” obama said at the design unveiling in chicago. obama has slowly started to return to the public eye since leaving office in january. last month he moderated an event at the university of chicago during his first major appearance since leaving the white house. the project will take around four years to complete, obama said, but educational programs will begin this year. obama said wednesday he would donate $2 million to a summer jobs programs in the community. obama grew up in hawaii and went to college in new york and california, but owns a home and spent most of his pre-white house political career in chicago, starting as a community activist before becoming an illinois state senator and then a u.s. senator. chicago beat out proposals by new york city and hawaii to be the home of the library. tod williams billie tsien architects partners of new york and interactive design architects of chicago were named last year as the firms that will lead the design of the center. residents of chicago’s south side, which includes many poor and crime-ridden neighborhoods, hope jobs and investment come with the library. some small businesses are concerned they may be forced out of the area if rental prices go up. the center could be a transformational project for the community, obama said.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.111428571428572,19.942857142857143,0.0,0.0

battle for rome's beachfront turns bloody with assault on journalist,"(please note: profanity in sixth paragraph) by isla binnie rome (reuters) - a bloody attack on a journalist has prompted outrage in italy and put the spotlight on suspected links between extreme right-wing politicians and organized crime in a notoriously unruly seaside suburb of rome. a local vote last sunday in ostia sent the anti-establishment 5-star movement and a center-right coalition to the second-round runoff, but also showed a sharp increase in support for neo-fascist group casapound. the vote is being closely watched as it is the first since the local government was dissolved two years ago by police, who said city hall - responsible for assigning lucrative beach concessions - had fallen under the influence of organized crime. ahead of the nov. 19 run-off, reporters from state tv rai went to interview roberto spada, the brother of an imprisoned mobster, who had expressed support for casapound on facebook and had been photographed with the local candidate. rai broadcast video showing reporter daniele piervincenzi repeatedly asking spada, on the doorstep of his gym, whether his family had supported casapound and if he thought it could change the down-at-heel neighborhood. i don t give a shit, spada eventually replies, before headbutting piervincenzi in the face and chasing the bloodied journalist with a baton. casapound s prime ministerial candidate simone di stefano told a news conference the attack was deplorable but said the party would not answer for spada s behavior as he was not a member. the local candidate said the photo taken of him with spada had happened to be snapped at a neighborhood event. rai said the blow broke piervincenzi s nose and doctors had told him he would need 30 days to recover. rome mayor virginia raggi tweeted the video, and wrote: unacceptable spada clan violence ... we will stop crime and extremism in rome. prime minister paolo gentiloni offered piervincenzi his solidarity for the brutal aggression suffered in ostia , and national police chief franco gabrieli said the incident showed the area still needs substantial work . a small player on the national stage, casapound won 9 percent of the vote in ostia, where it hands out food to poor and homeless italians, compared with 1.8 percent last time. casapound s di stefano challenged the judiciary to investigate whether there had been any arrangements by which votes were exchanged for money or favors in ostia, adding his group had won between 5 and 8 percent of the vote in three cities since early last year. if we had been in some way favored in ostia by a mafia clan, we would have had a boom there and in the rest of italy we would have got 0.4. that s not how it is, he said. spada was detained by police on thursday and a judge is due to decide on friday whether to formally arrest him.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.190000000000001,8.0,0.0,0.0
how obama is putting terrorist boots on the ground,"every american should be demanding answers about why barack hussein obama is in such a hurry to empty gitmo before he leaves office. illegal alien prisoners are being released at an unprecedented rate. our borders are being left wide open by a president who s demanded our us border agents stand down. visas are being given to people coming here with the sole intention of harming innocent americans. law enforcement has been ridiculed and weakened by a spiteful racist and his willing accomplices in the media. what do we need to do to alert the kim kardashian followers our united states of america is intentionally being destroyed by a radical in the white house?national security: the pentagon has cleared the release of 17 more terrorist detainees from guantanamo bay prison. president obama puts jihadist boots on the ground before mobilizing u.s. troops in the middle east.a congressional aide told fox news on thursday that the white house s strategy in the decision this week to set free more terrorist prisoners from the gitmo facility in u.s.-controlled territory in cuba is to get the number of detainees there to as low as they can get, even if it means a good deal of risk. the underlying reason is that closing gitmo was a major obama campaign promise in 2008, and he doesn t want to leave office with it still open.but the promise was to close it in 2009. upon taking office, however, obama found himself faced with the fact that gitmo was a rather brilliant idea that the bush administration came up with to prevent captured terrorists from exploiting the u.s. legal system.the spectacle of u.s. courts setting terrorists free, after trials in which the jihadists american legal teams might actually get access to and make public sensitive classified information, was not anything for which obama wanted to be blamed. he seems amenable, however, to his successor having nowhere to hold captured terrorists.release of the 17 supposedly low-level combatants, many of them from yemen, where war rages, brings the number of gitmo prisoners down to 90. we were told that osama bin laden s cook, ibrahim al-qosi, released by obama from gitmo in 2012, was low-level, but now he cooks up terrorist operations as a celebrity leader of al-qaida in yemen.the pentagon is going along with this politicized emptying of the guantanamo bay holding facility. and the decision coming right after an islamic state-inspired christmas party attack within the homeland, which slaughtered 14 innocent americans, suggests the u.s. military leadership has become a group of puppets.a major reason for former republican sen. chuck hagel s forced departure as obama s defense secretary last year after a brief tenure, let s not forget, was his hesitation in approving gitmo releases.in last week s gop presidential debate, it was a woman who promised that she would immediately reverse obama s emasculation of the pentagon. carly fiorina pledged to bring back the warrior class petraeus, mcchrystal, mattis, keane, flynn every one was retired early because they told president obama things that he didn t want to hear. obama calls gitmo a sad chapter in american history, but it was almost comic when the worst complaint shaker aamer, released from gitmo in october after nearly 14 years, could tell of in a british tv interview was they just suck all your feelings out of you, adding that torture is not about beating. torture is not about hanging from the ceiling with handcuffs and all that all that presumably being three square halal meals a day, courtesy of the u.s. taxpayer.curiously, the most transparent administration in history is now imposing new, severe restrictions on journalist access to guantanamo bay, with no more visits to the two detention centers where most detainees are housed, and no more interviews of guards and staff. outgoing u.s. southern command chief marine gen. john kelly told ap that the reason was: we really did have to get some organization to what was going on down there. after all these years?under obama, information on the frequency of prisoners assaulting guards and conducting hunger strikes has stopped being made public.it isn t torture or mistreatment that the obama administration is hiding from the world s eyes within the walls of guantanamo bay; it s that what we have down there is a luxury resort to house terrorists, and that the president is incrementally releasing those soldiers of jihad back onto the battlefield after america has spent years fattening them up. via: ibd",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.2755555555555596,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0
5 questions that now loom over tonight's debate,"5 questions that now loom over tonight's debate it's hard to be any more gobsmacked about the state of the presidential race right now, after a video of donald trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced friday, prompting more than 30 prominent republicans to call for him to step aside as the nominee. meanwhile, hillary clinton is also in headlines for a wikileaks email dump that included alleged excerpts of her speeches to wall street banks. but there is a debate sunday night, so its time to pick our jaws off the floor and contemplate 5 things we'll be watching: this is the big question of the night. trump, as usual, has given conflicting clues. in a video statement posted on facebook, he said he was sorry (""i said it. i was wrong. i apologize"") but also pivoted to an attack on bill and hillary clinton saying he abused women and she intimidated bill's accusers. later, he retweeted messages from juanita broaddrick, who claims bill clinton raped her. so what does trump prioritize: contrition or defiance? trump tweeted: ""the media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - i will never drop out of the race, will never let my supporters down! #maga"" mike pence, in an extraordinary show of disloyalty for a vice presidential candidate, briefly jumped off the tightrope he's been walking for weeks and issued trump an ultimatum for the debate. pence said he and his family were ""offended"" and said ""we look forward to the opportunity he has to show what's in his heart (tonight)"". something else might be going through trump's mind. the list of republicans calling on trump to step aside is growing, but the number is still tiny compared to the gop leaders who prefer to condemn trump's words while maintaining their support. house speaker paul ryan, for example, said he was ""sickened"" by trump's comments about grabbing women's genitals but he has not un-endorsed or called for him to step aside as the nominee. ryan was heckled by trump supporters at a campaign event in wisconsin saturday, which gives you an idea of how deep the split is inside the gop. trump's die-hard supporters are still the majority of the gop base. the administration believes russian security agencies authorized the hacking of democratic party officials emails in order to influence the u.s. elections (and hurt clinton). wikileaks posted emails from clinton campaign chairman john podesta — including ones from his gmail account that contain excerpts allegedly from clinton's paid speeches to wall street banks. in them she says she's for free trade and open borders and shows some sympathy for wall street bankers. they represent views that she subsequently moved away from as the campaign progressed, but you can see why she chose not to release the transcripts during her primary battle with bernie sanders .the hacked emails could hurt her with sanders supporters, (although sanders himself has dismissed them) younger voters ,and blue-collar democrats. if there is a contest for the october surprise prize, trump's hot mic probably beats wikileaks. still, tonight clinton will need to come up with a good explanation for why she said those things to a private room filled with wall street bankers. the debate format is unusual and presents lots of pitfalls for both candidates. there are two moderators (abc's martha raddatz and cnn's anderson cooper), but half the questions will come from ordinary voters. it's harder to attack your opponent in a room full of real people who want you to tell them how you will make their lives better. and any question from a voter has the presumption of validity — making it hard to ignore or to pivot away to boilerplate speech chunks or talking points (a favorite tactic of presidential candidates). but both campaigns claim this is a great format for their candidate. trump has spent more hours in front of a t.v. camera than any republican presidential candidate other than ronald reagan. even so, trump's ""practice town hall"" in sandown, n.h. on thursday night did not show that trump has learned how to connect with people the way a town hall format demands. the audience was handpicked supporters, the questions were vetted, friendly and read from notecards by the moderator. the clinton campaign says the town hall format is a good one for hillary clinton since she prefers small listening sessions and roundtables with small businesspeople or working moms over big set piece speeches at rallies. but most of the questions she gets in those forums are friendly softballs. clinton has been preparing diligently — as usual — for this debate. she presumably is working on better answers to questions about her emails, the wikileaks revelations and the line that was the most effective for trump in the first debate — that he represents change and she is the staus quo. winning means different things for clinton and trump. trump has a monumental task. even before the access hollywood hot mic audio was leaked, he was in a hole — a hole that he dug and kept digging for himself because of his poor performance in the first debate, his subsequent feud with former miss universe alicia machado, and the story about his $916 million dollar business loss/tax deduction. so tonight trump needs a performance so unexpectedly good that it will reverse that downward spiral. clinton, on the other hand, comes into the second debate with a small but growing lead in the polls. she needs to connect with voters and show them she's not the dishonest, unlikeable person they think she is. but most of all, her goal is to not screw up. a large number of issues have simply been absent from the conversation this campaign — such as health care, energy, job creation and economic growth. will voters tonight ask for specifics on any of these topics, or are they happy to watch another chapter in the food fight that campaign 2016 has become?

just in: mystery surrounds obama appointee judge who recused herself from fusion gps case also handling dnc corruption in awan brothers case,"a federal judge in washington, d.c. has recused herself from a second case involving trump dossier firm fusion gps.tanya s. chutkan, an obama appointee, recused herself on monday from a case involving a dispute over subpoenas issued for fusion gps, the firm that commissioned the dossier.this obama appointee is like so many others controversial. change.org has a petition calling for her impeachmenta supporter comment of the petition: there is clear and present danger, in our government and to our country. judge chutkin needs to do her duty, as sworn by oath, to let in all of the evidence pertaining to imran awan and hina alvi. as it stands today, 9/12/2017, judge chutkin is not doing her duty to protect the interests and lives of the citizens of the united states. for this reason, i am standing with others, shoulder to shoulder, and calling for the removal and impeachment of federal district judge tanya s. chutkin. aleksej gubarev, a russian tech executive accused in the dossier of hacking democrats computer systems, has sought to subpoena fusion gps records and to depose its employees to find out more about the research firm s work on the dossier.gubarev is suing buzzfeed for defamation for publishing the dossier earlier this year. he denies the allegations laid out in the document, which was written by former british spy christopher steele.chutkan recused herself last month from another case involving fusion gps. the firm had filed suit against its bank, td bank, to keep it from complying with a subpoena issued by the house intelligence committee, which sought fusion s bank records.chutkan presided over that case from oct. 20 to nov. 9. it was reassigned to judge richard leon, a george w. bush appointee. since taking over the case, leon has indicated that he plans to allow more transparency into the court proceedings involving the battle over fusion s bank records. he has ordered several documents be unsealed and made public.chutkan has presided over the case involving the lawsuit against buzzfeed since aug. 31. her replacement is trevor mcfadden, a trump appointee who assumed office in october.the reasons for chutkan s recusals remain a mystery chutkan refused to comment on the recusal but her work with a medical technology firm also represented by fusion gps could be the reason.in any case, this is yet another case of the obama hand in just about everything that has to do with corruption and intel agencies.read more: daily caller",1,22,0.0,0,0,0,0.043478260869565216,15.51727272727273,19.70909090909091,0.0,0.0
a massive screw up may have just cost trump the nomination – and it’s all his fault,"the people insisting the only thing standing in the way of donald trump s path to the nomination is donald trump himself may have finally been vindicated. in an explosive story first broken by time, republican officials in south carolina floated the idea that trump may have given away his landslide victory in the state by brashly announcing that he would no longer adhere to the loyalty pledge if he didn t get the nomination.south carolina republican party chairman matt moore gave credence to the anti-trump claims. breaking south carolina s presidential primary ballot pledge raises some unanswered legal questions that no one person can answer, he told time. however, a court or national convention committee on contests could resolve them. it could put delegates in jeopardy. what does this mean for trump? the 50 delegates he won in south carolina could simply walk away and over to his opponents. that sends his delegate count a lot further away from the crucial 1,237 finish line, and maybe give his opponents the push they need to realistically challenge him at a brokered convention. and adding to the problem: other states which include the loyalty pledge in their bylaws could also move to strip trump of his delegates.all of this to say, trump s massive ego is costing him the election. having early on floated the idea that he wouldn t support a republican candidate if it wasn t himself, trump eventually caved and signed a document stating: i, donald j. trump, affirm that if i do not win the 2016 republican nomination for president of the united states i will endorse the 2016 republican nominee regardless of who it is. suddenly, with opposition to his nomination mounting, trump has returned to saying he will not adhere to that pledge, telling anderson cooper matter-of-factly: no. i don t anymore, arguing that he s been treated unfairly by the gop.trump has repeatedly ignored conventional wisdom and used his gut to direct his campaign early on, trump s campaign manager told staffers that the motto of the campaign would be let trump be trump and while it often works to his advantage (who would have thought calling john mccain a loser for being a pow would pay off?), his increasingly erratic behavior makes him a ticking time bomb. cracks are beginning to emerge. his polls are tanking and there are signs that the anti-trump members of the republican party are finally coalescing around his chief rival, ted cruz. he may have enough momentum to get the nod, but needlessly handing away delegates isn t doing him any favors.in the end there was only one serious contender against trump and that was himself. for all of his arrogance, it is fitting that his own misplaced hubris would be the one thing that got the better of him. having run as an outsider for his entire campaign, trump is learning that bashing the party you plan to run for isn t welcomed with open arms. they let trump be trump and he didn t disappoint.featured image via darren hauck/getty images",1,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,5.400000000000002,8.9,0.058823529411764705,0.0
the daily traditionalist: jeff schoep and the nsm,"radio aryan october 29, 2016 matthew heimbach brings us the last show of the week accompanied by jason augustus and special guest jeff schoep from the national socialist movement. jeff tells us how he has been involved in white nationalism for around 25 years and reminds us of the sacrifices that many good men have made over that time to promote our cause, being imprisoned or physically attacked for their beliefs. the nsm is a political movement as well as being involved in street activism, so they are involved in a lot of community outreach work. jeff talks about how their roots go back to george lincoln rockwell and the only groups that have legitimate ties to his movement are the new order and the nsm. he was taught by the people who had learned from him and public service was always a part of what they were doing. jason asks what it was like to be a political skinhead involved in national socialism and what changes he has seen in his time. years ago a fight just used to be a fight, but nowadays you can be hit with hate crime charges as well, which can lead to lengthy prison sentences and ruined lives, just for a fistfight that may not have even involved racial politics. you cannot even defend your life any more without being charged with hate crime, as we have seen recently in britain, where activists have received serious jail time for defending themselves against violent antifa in kent. jeff is banned from britain as well as matt, not due to any criminal activity but just because his speech is politically incorrect. matt reminds us that the reason for this is because they have no answer to our talking points. they cannot debate us so they always seek to shut us down. the nsm will be taking an important role in the new nationalist front alliance with the twp and jeff talks about previous attempts to do this before, where good people have tried to broker a peace between the various organisations but due to petty reasons were never able to achieve it. he explains how the main problem has always been personality issues, where people have an issue with someone and then make up stories about them to cause problems. the twp and the nsm will be at a national rally together at the state capital of pennsylvania on november 5th and all are welcome, especially other organisations. jeff reminds us that although it is good to be promoting stuff on the internet, real political change has always been made on the streets. he suggests that if people are worried of being caught on camera, they should just wear a hat and sunglasses. matt points out that he has never met anyone at an event that he has ever then gone on to have problems with on the internet. for the last part of the podcast jeff talks about how he has worked to modernise the nsm, distancing them from german symbols and concentrating on american ones instead. he has taken some flak for this but believes that if we want to win, then we will have to start taking risks, after all, who dares wins. presented by matthew heimbach and jason augustus with special guest jeff schoep the daily traditionalist: jeff schoep and the nsm â dt 102816",1,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.705000000000002,8.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
"in jamaica, obama indicates that he will remove cuba from terrorism list","president obama indicated thursday that he is preparing to announce cuba’s removal from the u.s. state department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that should quickly lead to a full restoration of diplomatic ties and the opening of embassies in havana and washington. speaking at a gathering of caribbean leaders here, obama said the state department had finished a review of the issue. there is little doubt that it recommends he drop cuba from the list, and the only real question is when the announcement will be made. that could come as early as this week, as obama attends a summit of latin american leaders that for the first time will be joined by cuban president raúl castro. administration officials said a decision on when the president will take action has not been finalized and awaits formal consultation with other affected government agencies. [read: rare poll shows vast majority of cubans welcome closer ties with u.s.] but anticipation is already running high, and caribbean leaders with whom obama met on thursday voiced strong approval for the new era in u.s.-cuba relations. in washington, sen. benjamin l. cardin (md.), the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, issued a statement saying he welcomed what he said was the positive state department recommendation. obama confirmed that the white house had received the review but said he would “not make an announcement today.” he added, “i do think we’re going to be in a position to move forward on opening embassies.” as he began a meeting with jamaican prime minister portia simpson miller, obama noted that a new poll of cuban public opinion, published in thursday’s edition of the washington post, demonstrated “overwhelming support” for the normalization process and “overwhelming interest by most cubans to put one era behind us and move forward.” [read: what it means to drop cuba from list of terrorism sponsors] a positive announcement on the terror-list decision would be welcomed at the two-day summit of the americas, which obama will attend on friday and saturday in panama with up to 35 other leaders from across the western hemisphere. the summit is held every three years, and this will be castro’s first time in attendance. it will be obama’s third time, following meetings in 2009 and 2012 that were overshadowed by u.s. insistence that cuba be excluded. administration aides have strongly hinted that obama and castro will meet for more than a handshake at the summit, but they have not specified the nature of the encounter. a white house official said thurwday: “i can confirm that president obama spoke with president castro on wednesday, before president obama departed washington.” secretary of state john f. kerry also met with cuban foreign minister bruno rodríguez parrilla late thursday in panama city, the associated press reported. as delegations gathered on the eve of the summit, the presence of communist cuba made for some extraordinary and also ugly scenes. in one part of town thursday, at a forum for the chief executives of major u.s. companies including facebook, coca-cola and boeing, a cuban trade official invited america’s corporate leaders to visit the island, telling them his country was open for business. but at a parallel event at a different location, raucous pro- castro crowds disrupted a gathering of nonprofit and civil society groups, blocking cuban dissidents from participating and denouncing the event’s organizers for daring to invite them. the tensions, which had boiled over into a wild melee wednesday in a city park, were a reminder that cubans’ deep divisions will persist long after the united states reopens an embassy in havana. “we are deeply concerned by reports of attacks targeting civil society representatives in panama for the summit of the americas exercising freedom of speech and harassment of those participating in the summit of the americas civil society forum,” said state department spokeswoman marie harf, adding that the u.s. “condemns those who use violence against peaceful protesters.” the situation was also a sign that while the castro government is increasingly willing to tinker with its economic model, the experiment doesn’t extend to politics. the government also remains determined to stifle critics well beyond cuba’s borders. but rodrigo malmierca díaz, cuba’s minister of foreign trade and investment, said in a speech that although u.s. sanctions continued to limit american business with the island, obama’s recent moves were “a positive step.” malmierca said the castro government is seeking more than $8 billion in foreign investment in its new effort to spur growth. once obama approves the recommendation to delist cuba, congress will have 45 days to consider the proposal. but legislators have no power to alter such a recommendation except through new legislation, a move that is seen as unlikely. the administration has made the case to cuba that obama’s decision — even before the end of the 45 days — should be enough for the two countries to move forward on reopening embassies. cuba has said it cannot envision having full diplomatic relations with a country that has charged it with supporting overseas terrorism. in many ways, the u.s. designation, first imposed in 1982, is a cold war relic. although the united states strongly objects to cuba’s domestic policies, it has offered no evidence for decades that cuba is actively involved in terrorism abroad. leaders of 14 of the 15 members of the caribbean community, known as caricom, met here with obama. those in attendance ­welcomed the broader move toward normalization, which ­simpson miller called “a bold and courageous move . . . for the good of all of our people.” obama, she said, is “on the right side of history.” [obama moves to normalize relations with cuba as american is released by havana] while the focus of the caricom talks covered regional security and economic development, obama’s visit here is also part of a larger plan, which includes his outreach to cuba. the move is directly related to the administration’s efforts to improve u.s. standing in the region and to undermine venezuela’s attempts to draw the caribbean states into its orbit. for years, venezuela has used cut-rate oil to buy anti- american support from cash-strapped caribbean governments. in recent weeks, caracas, with money problems of its own, has rolled back energy subsidies to caricom members. with an energy security program announced in january by vice president biden, the obama administration hopes to help fund island infrastructure to receive and use u.s. gas and petroleum, and then to subsidize u.s. sales of energy products to the caribbean. as they try to wean island governments away from venezuela, administration officials have also attempted to play down their difficulties with caracas. thomas a. shannon, a senior aide to secretary of state john f. kerry, was in venezuela on thursday for meetings with president nicolás maduro. the visit aimed to give at least the impression that the united states is trying to smooth over its differences with the maduro government before the caricom meeting and the larger summit of the americas. miroff reported from panama city. david nakamura in washington also contributed to this story. where u.s.-cuba relations stand and what may change at the

trump humiliated at the beach this weekend with hilarious flying banner,"there s some funny business happening this weekend at the jersey shore, and it s not the usual shenanigans you have in mind. a democratic group is flying a huge banner today over the very busy beaches of the jersey shore with a hilarious anti-trump message.the banner that reads trump is on vacation with your $$ is being flown by the outspoken bridge project. they are flying it from beach haven all the way up north to sea bright.the group cleverly chose this location and weekend because the president is spending a leisurely weekend golfing at his nj beach resort. flying this banner is the perfect way to highlight the fact that trump is spending every weekend golfing at the beach rather than doing his job and to embarrass him about it, bigly.the irony of trump spending all his weekends golfing is that he used to slam president obama on twitter for playing golf while in the office. now, even trump s fellow republicans are recognizing that he is majorly out-golfing obama. senator joni ernst from iowa said in an april town hall speech that trump needs to spend way less time at mar-a-lago in florida if he wants to be an effective president. i do wish he would spend more time in washington, d.c. that s what we have the white house for. by april trump had spent as much time traveling during his presidency than obama did during the entire two terms in the white house. besides not being in d.c. doing his job, just one of trump s weekend getaways cost taxpayers $3.6 million.maybe this banner will help trump to see the error of his ways? ok, probably not, but at least it will embarrass the shit out of him.photo by mike ehrmann/getty images",1,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.22727272727273,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
putin offers transcript to prove trump did not pass russia secrets,"sochi/moscow (reuters) - vladimir putin said on wednesday that u.s. president donald trump had not divulged any secrets during a meeting in washington with russian officials and offered to prove it by supplying congress with a transcript. but a leading u.s. republican politician said he would have little faith in any notes putin might supply. two u.s. officials said on monday trump had disclosed classified information about a planned islamic state operation to russian foreign minister sergei lavrov when they met last week, plunging the white house into a fresh controversy just four months into trump’s tenure. trump, whose administration has been dogged by allegations that russia helped him win the white house and that he and his allies are too cozy with moscow, has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the russians after media reports of the meeting alarmed some u.s. and foreign politicians. president putin deployed his trademark sarcasm on wednesday to make clear he thought the accusation that trump had divulged secrets absurd. “i spoke to him (lavrov) today,” a smiling putin told a news conference with italian prime minister paolo gentiloni in the russian black sea resort of sochi. “i’ll be forced to issue him (lavrov) with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us. not with me, nor with representatives of russia’s intelligence services. it was very bad of him.” putin, who still hopes moscow can repair battered ties with the united states despite a deepening political scandal in the united states related to trump’s purported russia ties, said moscow had rated lavrov’s meeting with trump highly. if the trump administration deemed it appropriate, putin said russia could hand over a transcript of trump’s meeting with lavrov to u.s. lawmakers to reassure them that no secrets were revealed. a kremlin aide, yuri ushakov, later told reporters that moscow had a written record of the conversation, not an audio recording. u.s. republican senator marco rubio was unimpressed with putin’s offer and alluded to alleged russian hacking of democratic groups during the u.s. presidential election. “i wouldn’t put much credibility into whatever putin’s notes are,” rubio said on fox news. “and if it comes in an email, i wouldn’t click on the attachment.” representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, which is among those probing alleged russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election, called putin’s offer “quite amusing.” “the last person trump needs to vouch for him right now is vladimir putin,” schiff said in an interview with cbs news. “if they want to send something, you know, hats off. send it our way... it’s credibility would be less than zero.” russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the u.s. election. trump is also under pressure over accusations he asked then-fbi director james comey to end the agency’s investigation into the russia ties of former white house national security adviser michael flynn. the allegation stems from a memo written by comey and seen by a source familiar with the contents of the memo. in washington, republican and democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the comey memo. u.s. representative adam kinzinger joined a small but growing number of republican lawmakers who have said they would back some sort of independent investigation into russia’s role in the 2016 election. “if in fact what was in the memo is true, it’s very concerning and we need to get to the bottom of that,” kinzinger said on cnn. complaining about what he said was “political schizophrenia” in the united states, putin said trump was not being allowed to do his job properly. “it’s hard to imagine what else these people who generate such nonsense and rubbish can dream up next,” said putin, referring to unnamed u.s. politicians. “what surprises me is that they are shaking up the domestic political situation using anti-russian slogans. either they don’t understand the damage they’re doing to their own country, in which case they are simply stupid, or they understand everything, in which case they are dangerous and corrupt.” russia has repeatedly said that trump’s opponents are trying to damage him and moscow by making what it says are false accusations about the billionaire president and the russian government which initially had high hopes of a rapprochement. officials have told reuters trump’s alleged disclosure of classified information to russia’s foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with washington from cooperating. that view was reinforced on wednesday when british prime minister theresa may said her government had confidence in its relationship with the united states and would continue to share intelligence with britain’s most important defense and security ally.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.863636363636363,4.4,0.0,0.0

somali lawmakers seek to impeach president amid political crisis,"mogadishu (reuters) - some somali lawmakers said on wednesday they plan to impeach the president in a mounting political crisis that could put the fledgling government on a violent collision course with one of the country s most powerful clans. the political turmoil endangers fragile gains against the islamist al shabaab insurgency and could derail the government of president mohamed abdullahi. universally known by his nickname farmajo , the dual u.s.-somali citizen took power earlier this year in a u.n.-backed process. the horn of africa state s parliament adjourned last week until the end of february, but some legislators want it to reconvene on an emergency basis, lawmaker mahad salad told reuters. ninety-six lawmakers have asked the speaker to reopen the session so that the impeachment against the president kicks off. the president is accused of violation of the constitution, treason, destruction of the federal states and so on, he said. the letter had not yet been delivered to the speaker. there are 275 lawmakers and two-thirds would have to vote against the president to impeach him. the motion follows a deadly raid on sunday on the home of an opposition leader, abdirahman abdishakur warsame, who ran for the presidency against farmajo. somali security agents arrived at his house around midnight and engaged his guards in a firefight, killing five people. the minister of security said warsame resisted arrest and he would be charged with treason. he appeared in court on tuesday but no warrant was shown for his arrest, a witness said. a wednesday court hearing was postponed until thursday. the information minister did not return calls seeking comment. a statement from the security minister and attorney general said they were investigating the crimes of somalis who were involved in treason, terror and the destruction of government systems . warsame comes from somalia s formidable habar gidir clan, which is spread across south-central somalia. although both his supporters and the government stress that his detention is political, rather than a clan issue, it will further sour relations between the two sides. if that sparks fighting it could split somalia s security forces, which are composed mostly of clan-based militias. in september, a battle between the police, intelligence, and military killed nine people in mogadishu s habar gidir district. it s a lose-lose situation for the government. if they pursue this, they face a showdown with the habar gidir, who are powerful, wealthy and well-armed and provide many units in the sna, said a somalia security analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, referring to the somali national army. if they back down, they look weak. it s very hard to see how the administration could survive this crisis. in august, a joint u.s.-somali raid in the town of bariire killed 10 habar gidir members. the u.s. military said they were islamist militants but clan elders said they were civilians. in may, a soldier accidentally killed the minister of public works in a case of mistaken identity. a habar gidir clan member, the soldier was sentenced to death, angering clan members who felt that blood money should have been accepted. somalia s new government has won plaudits from diplomats for trying to assess the extent of mismanagement and corruption in the armed forces and the international monetary fund has praised it for fiscal reforms. but at home, the government has many problems. it has hired and fired a string of top security officials. al shabaab militants, skilled at exploiting clan divisions, stepped up a campaign of deadly bombings in mogadishu. one october bomb killed more than 500 people. a split between qatar and the united arab emirates, both of which have supported somali factions, has fuelled a spat between the president and leaders of somalia s regional administrations, damaging security cooperation. this month, the u.s. government announced it was suspending aid to most of the military over accountability concerns. now many parliamentarians are angry that a government that promotes itself as reformist is arresting critics like warsame, said abdirizak mohamed, a lawmaker and former security minister. mps are concerned about freedom of expression and association. this was an unnecessary crisis when they already had a lot on their plate.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,15.453333333333337,21.37777777777778,0.0,0.0
"how trump rallies the faithful: belittle clinton, news media","charlotte, n.c. (reuters) - republican presidential nominee donald trump’s campaign rallies have turned into eruptions of barely contained emotions from his impassioned followers, who urge him to fight on despite a series of gut punches that have put his chances of winning in doubt. with the nov. 8 election now only weeks away and polls turning against him, trump is spending precious time in campaign speeches defending himself from accusations from several women who say he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. what he would do if elected is covered, but much of his speeches are spent belittling his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. he also accuses the u.s. news media of a plot to bring him down, and charges that the women who have made the accusations against him might be doing it for a taste of fame. opinion polls show a gloomy picture for trump. a week after a video surfaced of him bragging in lewd terms about groping women, the latest reuters-ipsos poll on friday showed clinton up, with 44 percent to trump’s 37 percent. and the crowds have gotten more protective of their hero. one woman at a rally in cincinnati, ohio, on thursday wore a homemade t-shirt that said “trump can grab my,” with an arrow pointing to her crotch. on friday in greensboro, north carolina, a man wearing a “gays for trump” shirt punched a protester who held up an upside down american flag. both were ejected. trump’s message has gotten through to his supporters in a big way about clinton, who trump calls a criminal for her handling of classified information as secretary of state. “she would be the most dishonest and corrupt ever elected to high office,” he said. a crowd of young voters had a ready response when he brought up clinton at an event in columbus, ohio, on thursday. “lock her up!” they chanted, mimicking the lines voiced by older voters at other events. trump could only smile and shake his head. “so young and so jaded already,” he said. the new york businessman feeds off the energy generated by crowds that pack his rallies by the thousands. but he is easily distracted, lurching from topic to topic based on whatever happens to sprint to mind. on wednesday in lakeland, florida, trump jumped from bashing the news media as “the most dishonest people you’ll ever see,” to tout his performance at a debate in st. louis on sunday - “which i won big league” - to clinton’s stroll across the stage in front of him at that event. “and the papers said i invaded her space,” he said. “believe me, the last space i want to invade is hers.” there are moments of levity. a woman who recovered from a brief fainting spell in the heat of lakeland was pointed out by trump. “that woman was out cold and now she is recovered — a little ding to the head,” he said, approvingly. trump can form an attack line against clinton out of pretty much anything that springs to mind. venting about chinese trade practices before a raucous crowd of perhaps 20,000 in cincinnati on thursday night, trump suddenly imagined how china might treat clinton given her bout of pneumonia a month ago, which had caused her to nearly collapse at an event in new york. “if she goes down in tiananmen square, they’ll just leave her,” he said. “they’re tough people.” trump’s crowds sometimes get agitated. many of his supporters are upset at the news media, whipped into a frenzy by both trump and former new york mayor rudy giuliani, who in cincinnati introduced trump by condemning “the insanity of the media, the insanity of the way they cover him.” upon entering the arena, trump’s traveling press corps was booed by thousands of people who chanted “tell the truth.” trump boosters near the media work area repeatedly cursed and taunted reporters. “when are you all going to be ashamed of yourselves?” one man shouted. “lower than congress — that’s what your approval rating is.”",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.89777777777778,12.488888888888889,0.0,0.0
"dennis byrd, former jets player, is killed in car crash in oklahoma - the new york times","dennis byrd, a former jets defensive lineman who made an inspiring recovery from paralysis after a neck injury in 1992, died on saturday in a crash near claremore, okla. officials said. byrd was 50. a boy driving a sport utility vehicle north on oklahoma highway 88 veered into the oncoming lane about 11:15 a. m. striking an s. u. v. driven by byrd, who was pronounced dead at the scene, the oklahoma highway patrol said. the boy was taken to saint francis hospital in tulsa, okla. where officials said he was in stable condition. a boy was also injured in the crash. against the chiefs, on nov. 29, 1992, byrd and a teammate, scott mersereau, collided while chasing kansas city quarterback dave krieg. byrd broke a bone in his spine and could not move his lower body. “an eerie silence gripped the stadium as jets doctors and trainers attended to byrd for seven minutes,” according to a new york times article about the game. “hopes were raised when byrd moved his left arm. a few of his teammates drifted over to talk to him and hold his hand, then slowly they began to realize just how seriously injured he was. ” three days after byrd was injured, he underwent a operation at lenox hill hospital in manhattan to stabilize his spine. doctors thought it could take two years to determine whether he would be able to regain use of the lower half of his body, although they were already encouraged that byrd had been able to flex his ankles and move some toes. by the end of january 1993, byrd had made extensive progress in a therapy program at mount sinai hospital in manhattan. weeks later, using crutches, he appeared for an emotional news conference to mark the end of his rehabilitation program at the hospital. the story of byrd’s recovery was told in an autobiography, “rise and walk: the trial and triumph of dennis byrd,” and a television movie in 1994. byrd was born oct. 5, 1966, in oklahoma city, and he played for the university of tulsa before the jets drafted him in the second round in 1989. derrick gragg, the university’s vice president and director of athletics, said in a statement that byrd “exemplified true determination, tremendous heart and humility throughout his life. ” “he overcame great personal adversity after a injury on the football field,” gragg added. “we know that dennis touched numerous lives and will be missed by many. ” byrd became a motivational speaker and traveled across the country, sharing his life story, writing hundreds of letters a year and spending time with others who had neck and injuries. the jets presented him with an award as the team’s most inspirational player of 1992, and they have given the dennis byrd award to the most inspirational jet every year since. in 2010, byrd sent rex ryan, then the jets’ head coach, the no. 90 jersey that had been ripped from his torso after he was injured. in 2012, byrd became the fifth player in the franchise’s history to have his number retired. byrd lived in talala, okla. about 40 miles northeast of tulsa, with his wife, angela, and their four children, according to the jets’ website. the website quoted byrd as having said: “football has always been, for me, a cornerpost of strength and a way to accomplish things in life, whether it’s on the field or just in maintaining a quality of life. all those lessons — dedication, perseverance, teamwork — they all dovetail nicely into living a blessed life. ”",0,17,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.8750000000000036,8.9,0.058823529411764705,0.0
"with far-right in turmoil, france's le pen softens anti-eu stance","paris (reuters) - far-right leader marine le pen has said it is possible to improve the lives of french citizens without leaving the single european currency, in a marked shift from the anti-eu stance she pushed during her failed presidential bid. le pen s national front party has been in turmoil since her heavy defeat to emmanuel macron in may s presidential election, split by deep internal divisions over its view on europe that forced the departure of le pen s deputy last month. in numerous areas it is possible to improve the daily life of the french without quitting europe or the euro currency, le pen told weekly magazine valeurs actuelles in comments to be published on thursday. we have heard the french people, she said. her remarks are the clearest indication yet that the national front will focus on policies around immigration and national identity, and soften the anti-eu rhetoric that cost her dear in the election. while public discontent toward brussels has fueled nationalist sentiment in france, in particular in rural and low income areas, opinion polls show there is little appetite for france to follow britain out of europe, or to drop the euro. the departure of florian philippot, for years le pen s closest aide and a staunch advocate of an anti-euro, protectionist line, split the national front but also paved the way to a policy change as the far-right party seeks to rebrand itself. during her election campaign, le pen promised a referendum on eu membership. after suffering a bruising defeat to macron in the may run-off vote, le pen s national front won just eight seats in the national assembly, leaving it with a weak voice and unable to form a parliamentary group. last month, already toning down her language, she said that national sovereignty would be a mainstay of the party s struggle. we will continue to fight the european union with all our soul because it is an instrument for the impoverishment of people, she said in the wake of philippot s resignation.",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.830000000000002,4.0,0.0,0.0

(washington, dc) citing sources at the fbi, fox news anchor bret baier said the fbi’s renewed investigation of hillary clinton’s email server will almost certainly end in an indictment, unless some sort of “obstruction” arises. baier made the claim wednesday night during a broadcast of “on the record” with brit hume. he said that a “lot of evidence” had been recovered from anthony wiener’s laptop, and made an eventual indictment appear very likely, even if it came months after the election. “i pressed, again and again, on this very issue,” baier told hume. “these sources said, yes, the investigations will continues [sic], there’s a lot of evidence, and barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they’ll continue to, likely, an indictment.” baier didn’t say exactly who would be the most most likely target of an indictment, and what the timeline on such an indictment would be. baier also said that his sources had greater than 99 percent confidence that clinton’s private email server had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies. when fbi director james comey first announced last summer that no charges would be recommended regarding clinton’s server, he said the fbi had no way of knowing whether the server had been hacked. clinton’s presidential campaign aggressively downplayed the severity of the renewed investigation into her private email server, and criticized the judgment of comey for publicly announcing it. daily caller copy, trunews analysis please contact trunews correspondent edward szall with any news tips related to this story. email: | twitter: @edwardszall | facebook: ed szall download the trunews mobile app on apple and google play ! donate today! support trunews to help build a global news network that provides a credible source for world news we believe christians need and deserve their own global news network to keep the worldwide church informed, and to offer christians a positive alternative to the anti-christian bigotry of the mainstream news media top stories",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.520000000000003,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0

service. “it’s abysmal,” he said. nationwide, only 4 in 10 callers to the agency’s toll-free help line are getting through to a real person. the number of “courtesy disconnects” — a euphemism for an overloaded system hanging up on the customer — has reached 5 million so far this year, the agency reported. when callers do get a real person, they can forget about asking questions that require expertise. these are now considered “out of scope.” the customer-service agents have been instructed to only tell callers what tax forms they need, where to get them and where to look for online information. staff can no longer offer line-by-line assistance, provide guidance on tax planning or tax law, or help make payment arrangements. and with 5,000 fewer agents than four years ago to go after tax cheats, officials estimate that $2 billion in revenue will go uncollected. at the dallas tax assistance center, there’s an empty space where the office printer sat before it was yanked out. the maintenance contract was too expensive. the shelves in the forms room are mostly bare. the 40-page p-17, the bible of tax-return preparation, now costs $23 and must be ordered online. overcrowding at the dallas center came to a head in february when the fire marshal showed up and notified its manager, johnny holiday, that he couldn’t have customers sitting on the floor and blocking exits and walking space. so now, no one gets in the door unless the person has a seat in one of the 40 chairs in the waiting area. late last month, holiday called security officers when a man lunged at an employee, cursing, after waiting two hours to drop off documents for an audit. holiday spends his time devising strategies to bring order to an office that, this being the irs, should thrive on order. twenty minutes before the doors open at 8:30 a.m. on a recent morning, he’s making sure that the line elimination team is in place. its job is do triage on the line, pulling customers out of the queue who have straightforward requests, such as asking to make a payment or to get a copy of an old return. employees move along the line, handing out paper tickets as at the deli counter, asking customers in spanish and in english why they are here. this task takes three of his specialists. that leaves only eight others to meet with taxpayers and answer their questions. as money has gotten tighter, the demands have grown. two years ago, another walk-in center in desoto, 16 miles south of dallas, closed, leaving the irs office in the earle cabell building to absorb the business. with its gray carpets, dropped ceilings with fluorescent lights and keypad-coded doors five blocks from where john f. kennedy was shot, the 16-story building in downtown dallas built in 1968 is a monument to a time when there was more optimism about the federal government. since 2010, republicans on capitol hill have slashed the irs budget by $1.2 billion, or about 17 percent, adjusting for inflation. just this fiscal year, $346 million was cut. by contrast, cuts across the rest of the government have been far more modest and concentrated. between 2012 and 2014, automatic spending reductions shrank non-defense spending, as adjusted for inflation, by 1.3 percent, while irs spending was chopped 5.6 percent, according to scott lilly, a budget expert at the center for american progress. even in an era of shrinking government, conservatives’ antipathy toward the tax-collection agency stands out. it is punishment for a string of missteps: an extravagant conference for employees in anaheim, calif., the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax exemptions, $1 million in bonuses given to agency employees who didn’t pay their federal taxes. “we deliberately lowered irs funding to a level that will make the irs think twice about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it,” rep. ander crenshaw (r-fla.), who chairs the house panel that sets the agency’s budget, said at a hearing last month. the irs, he said, should “focus on core missions providing taxpayer services.” leslie paige, vice president for policy and communications at citizens against government waste, said every government agency could sustain deep cuts and in particular the irs. “i think taxpayers and their representatives need to think long and hard about throwing more money at an agency that has proven that it persistently mismanages and wastes the money they have gotten in the past,” she said. as funding has declined, the agency’s workload has grown. the irs is helping to administer subsidies and compliance under president obama’s health-care law and dealing with other new wrinkles in the tax code. it is also battling an epidemic of identity theft and new, sophisticated cheating schemes. since the budget cuts, employees have processed 11 percent more returns, the irs said. koskinen, hired to restore trust in the irs, is also looking for money to upgrade a system that still runs on cobol, the computer language that debuted half a century ago. he needs more revenue agents. in dallas, they only go after people who’ve cheated the government out of $1 million or more. “at this point it is a little frustrating when people say, ‘we keep cutting your budget so you’ll be more efficient,’ ” koskinen said. when jerry reed finally made it to a cubicle inside the dallas center, andrew concha apologized for the long wait. reed just shrugged his shoulders. reed’s tax return had been flagged because it reflected a refund of more than $10,000. the irs suspected that reed was a victim of identity theft. in reality, reed was due the refund because he had taken a large business loss when his consulting business failed. he tried to resolve the confusion online but couldn’t figure how to proceed. he called the toll-free line, waited on hold for 90 minutes and hung up. then he drove to the federal building one day after work, but he was too late to get a ticket. in the past, irs employees would work as late as midnight during tax season, but now, with the elimination of overtime pay, they go home at 4:30 p.m. “because of the cuts, people have really lost patience with us,” concha said. in the high-rise building next door, money ran out for 200 seasonal employees a full month before the april 15 deadline, and they are being sent home, agency officials said. “they know the minute we say, ‘i’m going to have to transfer you to someone who can answer your question,’ they’re going to be on hold for a number of hours,” said donna miller, an agent working for the local chapter of the national treasury employees union. just then, an announcement came over the loudspeaker inviting all employees to room 212 at 1 p.m. for a retirement party for a woman named peg. peg was not being replaced because of an irs hiring freeze. no choice but to wait it has fallen to chris caroll, the operations manager, to buck up his beleaguered staff. bald with a goatee, he walks the seven floors of cubicles every day, urging employees to e-mail, call and knock on his door if they need to talk. “we knew we had to be empathetic versus the typical management style,” he said. yet he cannot even order them calendars, calculators or rulers. back downstairs, laurence zeigler had figured out that he wouldn’t get to see anyone at the irs on this day. all he needed, he said, was to give them his correct address. near the exit, his credentials in a faded gray folder that long ago carried his vo-tech diploma, he vented to a friendly security guard. “man, i just got laid off,” he said. “it’s like, i really need that money.” his $400 refund had been held up by an incomplete return. “i would just call them,” the guard offered. waiting on hold did not sound like a great idea to zeigler. concha had come back out to check on the line. “if you get in this line, the wait will be two hours,” he told an anxious woman, who wanted to make sure her automated tax payment went through after her bank changed. “if you get inside, it will be another two hours.” “did you say, another two hours?” someone called out. it was kim garrett, on her fifth visit to clear up the matter of her social security number, which she said the irs didn’t have. “you can’t call,” garrett said, to anyone who would listen. “you can’t get online, and you can’t see anybody. what are your options?” the others in line nodded in agreement.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.705000000000002,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0

california lawmakers approve hiking minimum wage to $15,"sacramento, calif. (reuters) - a plan to raise california’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 passed both houses of the state legislature on thursday, putting the state on track to become the first in the nation to commit to such a large pay hike for the working poor. the measure, incorporating a deal governor jerry brown reached with labor leaders and progressive democrats in the legislature, was approved in the state senate thursday afternoon after winning approval earlier in the day in the assembly, and now goes to brown for his signature. “if you work full time, your family shouldn’t live in poverty,” assembly speaker anthony rendon, a southern california democrat, said in support of the bill to raise the state’s minimum wage from its current level of $10 per hour. lawmakers from the state’s poorer regions said the measure could harm small businesses that are barely hanging on amid double-digit unemployment, ultimately leading to job losses. if enacted, the bill would put california, home to one of the world’s biggest economies, among a growing number of u.s. states and cities that have moved in recent years to surpass the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. a proposal to raise the minimum wage in parts of new york state to $15 was announced thursday by governor andrew cuomo and legislative leaders. the california measure would gradually raise the state’s hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022 for large businesses and by 2023 for smaller firms. the measure would also head off two competing ballot initiatives lacking a provision to allow the governor to suspend increases in hard economic times, a deal breaker for brown. the proposal sped through the legislative process after the governor’s office reached a deal last week with labor unions pushing a similar minimum wage hike in the form of two ballot initiatives. with polls showing strong support for those measures at the ballot box, brown emphasized that a version passed through the legislature would allow lawmakers to amend it if needed over time instead of going back to voters to request amendments in expensive and uncertain campaigns. moreover, the deal allows the state to opt out of minimum wage increases if the economy is doing poorly, a provision not in either of the union-backed ballot initiatives. even so, several moderate democrats and most republicans complained that it was being rushed through, and would disproportionately harm businesses in poorer parts of the state, where the cost of living is not high enough to warrant such a dramatic wage hike. the deal reached in new york would raise wages in costly new york city to $15 in three years, but would stagger increases in other parts of the state, some to just $12.50 per hour unless further approval is granted. it still must pass the legislature, where negotiations on the details are ongoing.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.605000000000004,18.2,0.0,0.0

over $500 million in thai bank shares transferred on behalf of king: sec,"bangkok (reuters) - shares worth over $500 million in thailand s siam commercial bank have been transferred on behalf of king maha vajiralongkorn from the crown property bureau, which manages palace assets, a filing with thailand s securities and exchange commission (sec) said on friday. the filing by the crown property bureau did not identify the ultimate beneficiary of the shares, nor did it indicate if any money had been paid for the shares. the transfer took place on oct 2, the filing said. the law was changed in july to formally give the king control of the crown property bureau. details of its assets are not made public, but they are estimated to be worth more than $30 billion. the crown property bureau confirmed the transaction but declined comment on how the transfer fitted with changes to the way palace finances are run since the king took the throne late last year after the death of his revered father. it is his majesty s private affair so i cannot comment further, said an official of the crown property bureau who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of anything to do with thailand s palace. the king has put an increasingly assertive stamp on the monarchy since succeeding his father king bhumibol adulyadej, who will be cremated on oct. 26 in a ceremony that marks an end to more than a year of mourning in thailand. siam commercial bank, thailand s third-largest bank by assets, declined to comment on the transaction in its shares. the filing said that the shares transferred amounted to 3.33 percent of the total value of the bank. after the transfer, the crown property bureau still had a holding of 18.14 percent, it said. based on the latest share price, the shares had a value of 16.9 billion baht ($505 million). at the latest dividend yield of 3.62 percent, the shares would give a payout of around $18 million a year. shares in scb closed 0.66 percent down on friday compared to a 0.22 percent fall in the banking index. the crown property bureau s stakes in scb and siam cement pcl are together worth around $8.3 billion. according to a former official within the crown property bureau, they have accounted for up to 80 percent of the agency s income in recent years. although its real estate holdings are bigger, the returns from those are much lower.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.91076923076923,5.2,0.0,0.0
"china's communist party to discuss amending constitution, graft fight","beijing (reuters) - china s ruling communist party will meet next month to discuss amending the constitution and to talk about the ongoing fight against graft, state media said on wednesday, ahead of march s expected passing of a new anti-corruption law. fighting deeply ingrained graft has been a key policy plank for president xi jinping in his first term in office, and that battle will take on a new hue with the setting up of the national supervision commission as he begins his second term. trial work has already begun for that commission, which is likely to be formally codified in law in march at the meeting of china s largely rubber stamp parliament. the new body will take over from the central commission for discipline inspection (ccdi) and merge multiple anti-graft units into a single body. it will also expand the graft campaign s purview to include employees at state-backed institutions rather than just party members. in a short report, xinhua news agency said the party s politburo, one of its elite ruling bodies, had met and decided to hold two important meetings next month - one on amending the state constitution and the other specifically on fighting corruption. xinhua gave no details of what the constitutional amendment might entail, but chinese legal scholars have said the country needs to amend its constitution before it can set up the new supervision commission to ensure there is a proper constitutional basis for its powers. the constitution clearly defines china s top political institutions, such as the judiciary and the prosecutor, in order to grant them state power and changes need to be made to these definitions to make room for a similarly powerful supervision system, scholars argue. the party will discuss the amendment, or amendments, at a plenum next month, xinhua said without giving an exact date or saying whether it was one amendment or more. the constitution, which is different from the party constitution, was last amended in 2004 to include guarantees to protect private property and human rights. the other meeting, a full session of the anti-corruption watchdog the ccdi, will be held from jan. 11-13, the report added, again without giving details. xi has vowed that his war against graft will not ease until officials at all levels dare not, cannot and do not want to be corrupt. xi told top party leaders in october revision of the anti-graft architecture would include the scrapping of a controversial shuanggui system of secret interrogations, and the introduction of a new detention system. the latest draft of the new supervision law, unveiled last week, adds protections for graft suspects as part of efforts to revise the interrogation system.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.831111111111113,16.933333333333334,0.1111111111111111,0.0

uzbek writer plans cautious return from exile,"almaty (reuters) - when uzbek writer nurulloh muhammad raufkhon s new book came out last year, security forces raided his home and put the author - who was in turkey at the time - on their blacklist, effectively forcing him to stay there in exile. now, after being removed from the list by the new government, the 62-year-old raufkhon plans to return to his central asian homeland - despite harboring some misgivings. a safe return of prominent dissidents such as raufkhon might herald a genuine thaw in uzbekistan and mark a significant step toward restoring ties with the west and attracting foreign investment after decades of political and economic near-isolation under the late president islam karimov. no prominent dissidents have returned home yet though since karimov died a year ago and raufkhon said some of his fellow emigres were still unconvinced it was safe to do so. raufkhon s book, entitled bu kunlar (these days), was a critique of uzbekistan s development since it became independent from the soviet union in 1991. by publishing it, he went against a well-established taboo on criticizing karimov, who ran the nation of 32 million with an iron fist from 1989, first as a communist apparatchik and then as an elected leader. he died in september last year from a stroke aged 78. they all but made me an enemy of the people , traitor of the motherland , raufkhon, who lives in istanbul, said in an interview with reuters conducted by email and telephone. last month, the government of shavkat mirziyoyev, a former prime minister who has succeeded karimov, removed some 16,000 people, including raufkhon, from its security blacklist. that prompted him to start thinking about a return home. but he had second thoughts very soon - and he is still slightly apprehensive of possible action by a karimov old guard . after they removed me from the blacklist, somebody decided to put up a list of wanted criminals with photos in the district where i am registered, he said. my name was among them. local officials quickly corrected the mistake and covered up his photo, he said, but the incident all the same made him uneasy. i didn t understand this. do we have a parallel state? he said. (but) in the end, i dismissed this as a mistake and decided to return. to address mistakes like that you need to be back home. raufkhon said there could be more setbacks. of course, it is impossible to swiftly change a regime based on violence, he said, adding that a karimov-era elite was strongly resisting reforms. one of the new government s moves that has raised eyebrows was the sacking last month of khurshid mirzohidov, a reformist chief executive of state television company mtrk. mirzohidov, previously minister for information technology development, was appointed to mtrk in february as part of a broad reshuffle which followed mirziyoyev s election last december. a major change brought on by mirzohidov was a series of q&a sessions broadcast live on national television in which senior officials had to answer tough questions - such as those about the use of forced labor in cotton harvesting. after mirzohidov was sacked, alisher khajayev, who had run state television under karimov, took back the top job. though live broadcasts have continued after the reshuffle, khajayev has yet to show he will maintain the same probing tv programs as mirzohidov. speaking of fellow emigres, raufkhon said: they would have come back in an instant, but what stands in their way is uncertainty about what is going to happen to them upon return. he urged the government to amnesty all opposition activists and guarantee their safety upon return. raufkhon said he would announce the date of his own return this week.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.368571428571428,2.8000000000000003,0.0,0.0
comey must explain why he advised obama not to publicly accuse russia of hacking democrats,"by sarah jones on tue, nov 1st, 2016 at 1:26 pm comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the u.s. presidential election, and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as ""partisan"". share on twitter print this post russia did hack the democrats. so all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the u.s. election. but fbi director james comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the u.s. presidential election, and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as “partisan”. republican fbi director james comey advised the obama administration not to publicly accuse russia of hacking the dnc and more “on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the nov. 8 election,” officials “familiar with the deliberations” told the washington post. these sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the post on the condition of anonymity. there are a few reasons why comey might want to keep his agency’s investigation of russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of clinton’s emails, which resulted from a republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless benghazi investigation that also cleared clinton, it seems odd that comey was going to stay silent on the russia matter. comey’s decisions is especially odd given the reports that the russians have been communicating and coordinating with republican presidential nominee donald trump to the point that he is already “compromised.” only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the united states president. the same sources tell the post that comey made the decision to reveal the clinton emails to congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. not sure i’m buying that because if comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldn’t have said anything at all, but that doesn’t mean that his motives were nefarious. there might well be good reason for this – after all, this is the fbi and they can’t tell us everything, but as of right now comey has mishandled this `and appears to be trying to influence an election to help republicans. just because he is a republican and just because he has donated to republicans doesn’t mean he isn’t doing his job properly. but comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. he is under fire for good reason, as the explanations he’s giving for these decisions don’t make sense and are contradictory.",1,15,0.0,0,0,0,0.06666666666666667,10.713333333333338,14.0,0.0,0.0
trump's son-in-law kushner to become senior white house adviser,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president-elect donald trump’s son-in-law, jared kushner, will become a senior white house adviser working on trade and the middle east, transition officials said on monday, in a rare case of a close presidential family member taking a major job. kushner, 35, who is married to trump’s daughter ivanka, is taking the post after receiving legal counsel that doing so would not violate u.s. anti-nepotism law, transition officials said. the position, unlike cabinet posts, does not require u.s. senate confirmation, and kushner will not be paid. trump, in a statement on monday announcing the choice, said kushner was a “tremendous asset and trusted advisor throughout the campaign and transition.” kushner, who like trump is a new york real estate developer, emerged as an important voice early in his father-in-law’s presidential campaign and was involved in almost every aspect of it from personnel decisions to strategy and fundraising. ivanka trump, who like her husband has been a close adviser to the president-elect, will not take on a role in her father’s white house but will focus on settling her family in washington. kushner and his wife will undertake significant divestments of their wide-ranging financial portfolios as they prepare for their move to washington from new york and face inevitable questions about a potential conflict of interest. senior transition officials and a lawyer for kushner laid out the arrangement in a conference call with a small group of reporters. kushner is to work closely with incoming white house chief of staff reince priebus and senior strategist steve bannon in advising the new president, and the officials said he would focus at least at first on trade policy and the middle east. trump, who takes office on jan. 20, has vowed to rewrite international trade deals to make them more favorable to the united states. he has also pledged to move the u.s. embassy in israel from tel aviv, where it has been for 68 years, to jerusalem, all but enshrining the city as israel’s capital despite international objections. jamie gorelick, a new york lawyer who served as deputy attorney general for democratic president bill clinton and helped advise kushner, said his new post would not violate a 1967 anti-nepotism statute. she said congress in 1978 authorized the president to hire personnel for the white house office “without regard” to federal personnel laws like the anti-nepotism statute and that court rulings had determined the white house was not an “agency” under the anti-nepotism law. “i’m not saying that there isn’t an argument on the other side, and i respect the people who have made the argument on the other side. i just think we have the better argument,” gorelick said. richard briffault, a government ethics expert at columbia law school, disagreed, saying: “given the fact that the president is specifically mentioned, you would think that someone that is working for the president would be covered” by the anti-nepotism law. bill clinton aroused controversy in 1993 when he named his wife, hillary clinton, to lead his healthcare reform drive. she lost the nov. 8 election to trump. after john f. kennedy was elected president in 1960, he chose his brother robert as attorney general. late on monday, a group of six democrats on the house of representatives judiciary committee said they had written to the justice department and u.s. office of government ethics asking them to review concerns about nepotism and conflicts of interest arising from kushner’s appointment. in order to comply with federal ethics laws and after consulting the office of government ethics, kushner will take a number of steps to divest substantial assets, gorelick said. kushner will resign from his positions as chief executive of the kushner companies and as publisher of the new york observer newspaper and divest from any interests in the new york observer, thrive capital, the 666 fifth avenue office building in midtown manhattan and any foreign investments. in addition, kushner will recuse himself from participating in matters that could have a direct effect on his remaining financial interests. those interests include real estate in the new york area, ivanka trump’s interest in the new trump hotel in washington and the ivanka trump brand fashion business, the officials said. kushner will file a public financial disclosure form. norman eisen, a former ethics chief under president barack obama, said in an email that kushner’s ethics and disclosure moves appeared to be a “positive step.” “i hope his father-in-law takes a page from his book and does the same, as presidents have for the past four decades, by divesting into a blind trust or the equivalent,” eisen said. trump has said he would transfer control of his business to his children, but he has given no details. a planned news conference in december on the topic was canceled. trump is expected to take questions from reporters this week.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.58666666666667,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
michele bachmann confuses direct-to-dvd movie plots with reality in new obama antichrist theory,"picture it. a marginalized but divinely inspired individual (michele bachmann) makes the huge discovery that the bible predicts a global conspiracy. it s engineered by the antichrist (president obama) to get the world to declare war on israel, steal their energy and usher in the end of the world. will michele be able to beat the odds and save us all from destruction?spoiler alert she already did. it seriously sounds like the plot to a 99 cent movie in the discount dvd bin, but sadly it isn t anything so harmless. right wing watch reported that america s most adorable prophetic savior, michele bachmann, announced how the bible told her the syrian civil war is just a false flag operation to cover up a plan by obama to kick-start armageddon. bachmann also said that world leaders were set to grant legitimacy to the islamic state, russian and iranian intervention in syria was a setup to invade israel by those nations and china will be helping russia and iran to help make sure it matches biblical prophecy better.bachmann then linked this all to president obama becoming the antichrist by transforming into an evil world leader secretary-general of the united nations. bachmann was quoted as saying obama would only go into an empowered, powerful un, that was powerful enough to see the united states come under the un s authority. since we won t be getting anything sensible out of michele, right wing watch thankfully found where she got her idea. it turns out it wasn t from the bible but from a report in the right-wing rag investor s business daily. ibd cited what may be a non-existent report from al-jarida that this is happening. al-jarida is the same publication that suggested obama will shoot down israeli aircraft if they try to attack iran, so their credibility is dubious at best. either way you look at it, it seems michele saved the world yet again by letting obama s secret out and ruining his plans.listen to michele bachmann tell you about obama, the antichrist, and all that nonsense below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244927649 params= color=ff5500 width= 100% height= 166 iframe= true /]featured image from flickr",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.895384615384618,17.50769230769231,0.0,0.0

"in rural america, a startling prospect: voters obama lost look to sanders","shelley brannon, 62, can sum up the obama presidency with three words. well, three words and an exclamation. “he screwed us,” said brannon, a coal miner from wise county, va., as he sat outside a rally for the united mine workers of america. “man, he screwed us.” he shook his head under a camouflage hat that matched his camouflage umwa t-shirt, and he described his fantasy of dumping nuclear waste in the yards of environmentalists, “if they think coal’s so bad.” he mulled over the mistake he says the umwa made in 2008, when it endorsed barack obama over hillary rodham clinton. then he explained why he would probably be voting for sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) in the next democratic primary. “for one thing, he knows what union is, and he respects it,” brannon said. “that’s all we need is respect. he’s just a likable fellow, trustworthy. i don’t think she has the same respect for the union, and she really shot herself in the foot over, you know, all that secretive stuff.” west virginia has rejected the obama-era democratic party more dramatically than any other state outside the south, with appalachian counties that voted for michael dukakis and walter mondale turning blood red over the past eight years. but if you think it’s in places like this where the insurgent sanders campaign faces its most formidable test, here’s what he thinks: it is also one of his greatest opportunities. the vermont socialist believes that white, working-class voters — the sort of people obama once self-defeatingly said “cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren’t like them” — are just one honest argument away from coming back. “we have millions of working-class people who are voting for republican candidates whose views are diametrically opposite to what voters want,” sanders said in an interview. “how many think it’s a great idea that we have trade policies that lead to plants in west virginia being shut down? how many think there should be massive cuts in pell grants or in social security? in my opinion, not too many people.” this state, one of the last to vote in the 2016 primary race, is supposed to be clinton country. seven years ago, in the 2008 primary, west virginia democrats gave clinton a landslide victory over obama. she won 69 percent of the white vote and did even better with voters who lacked a college education. a democrat who improved a few points on obama’s 39 percent of the national white vote in the 2012 general election would stroll into the white house. sanders, who has won elections only in a white, rural state, thinks his brand of bold democratic socialism can sell. he has never campaigned here, yet at friday’s rally in morgantown, miner after miner said they basically agreed with the former mayor of burlington more than they agreed with clinton. several were aware that sanders had walked picket lines, something that resonated as they packed a hotel ballroom to demand that washington fully fund umwa pensions. when the room quieted, a man recited a prayer against greed. “lord, we know that satan has those corporate thieves,” he said, “and they’re still trying to rob us.” then a singer-songwriter started in: it’s a long way to wall street from 12th and main and the back roads of my home town. there’s a new world order and times have changed, so they let these deals go down. sanders’s campaign theory may be that there’s a larger electorate hiding in plain sight. over the summer, as he gained in polls, sanders was criticized for bringing seemingly every issue back to the sediment of economics and class. black lives matter activist marissa johnson dubbed it “class reductionism.” clinton allies had trouble seeing how his support could grow beyond white liberals. sen. joe manchin iii (d-w.va.), who has endorsed clinton, said sanders has a weakness in west virginia greater even than the socialist label: coal. although the economics-first focus makes sense, manchin said, sanders’s support for every major obama initiative on the environment makes his candidacy a “nonstarter” here. “his environmental stance?” manchin asked. “oh, my, it would be awful.” but sanders believes that such naysayers are missing the weight of his cardinal argument — for greater economic fairness — and voters’ willingness to look past the other issues where they disagree. he has won elections in vermont, a white, rural, gun-owning state, as a socialist. the social-issue “distractions” bemoaned by red-state democrats have seemed to bounce right off his armor. (he has taken mixed positions on gun control, supporting a ban on assault rifles, for instance, but opposing the brady bill.) in the end, is the white guy who voted for him in vermont any different than the white guy in west virginia or kentucky or ohio who was told to blame liberals for his problems? [a key to the southern vote lies centuries ago on another continent ] “what i’ve found in vermont and around the country is that we go to people and say, ‘look, we do have differences,’ ” sanders said. “ ‘i believe in gay marriage. i’m not going to change your view if you don’t. i believe climate change is absolutely real, and some of you do not. but how many of you think we should give hundreds of billions in tax breaks to the richest 1 percent?’ ” conservative sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) has made a similar argument — that his party can win, with no changes to its message, if more evangelical voters are inspired to come out. bolstering sanders’s case are his strong numbers in independent polls. a national quinnipiac survey last month found him polling marginally better against leading republican candidates than clinton did. a marquette university poll last week indicated that sanders is running just as strong as clinton in wisconsin, home to some of the white voters who have abandoned the democrats in off years. something similar may be happening in west virginia. in morgantown, home to west virginia university, a 62-year-old activist named andy cockburn went to an early organizing meeting for clinton and found only 10 other people. in july, more than 100 people packed a bar basement and started organizing for sanders. railing against oligarchies and “the 1 percent” means one thing in new york or san francisco. it means more in west virginia, where coal magnate don blankenship is standing trial and patriot coal is trying to spend most of a $22 million settlement for miners on its own attorneys. on friday night, at the democrats’ jefferson-jackson dinner in the state capital, charleston, bill clinton echoed his wife and condemned patriot. but sanders is the candidate with consistency on corporate greed — a fact that has helped him slow down some labor endorsements for clinton. according to the new york times, the international association of fire fighters hit the pause button on its expected endorsement after too many local leaders blanched. on saturday, sanders lost the endorsement of the national education association but only after a similar protest made clinton work for it. the umwa has never endorsed clinton. in 2008, it went for the doomed campaign of john edwards, switching to obama only after he had basically sewn up the nomination. in 2012 it made no endorsement, in an avowed protest of the administration’s environmental regulations. this year, the union, with 32,354 of its 71,160 members based in west virginia, is not yet close to a decision. “what we’re going to do is base our decision on our future here,” umwa president cecil roberts said in an interview — “whether we’re going to have health care, have pensions, have jobs for people in appalachia.” that question could vex sanders just as much as clinton. in his energy talking points, sanders notes that he “introduced the gold standard for climate-change legislation with sen. barbara boxer to tax carbon and methane emissions,” a résumé item that would be about as welcome in west virginia as a university of maryland terps jersey. asked what he would say to a coal miner who blames environmental protection agency regulations for the loss of his job, sanders said he could only be straight with him. “what we have to say is, ‘look, through no fault of your own, you’re working in an industry which is helping to cause climate change and in fact having a negative impact on the country and world,’ ” sanders said. “what the government does have is an obligation to say: ‘we’ll protect you financially as we transition away from fossil fuel. we are going to create jobs in your community, extended unemployment benefits. if you lose your job to a trade deal, you get benefits for two years. you get job training.’ i would take that same approach to energy jobs that are lost because of the threat of climate change.” nothing about sanders’s pitch is easy, but this piece is especially rough. state rep. mike caputo (d), a miner and a union member, said his brothers need jobs, not pity. in an interview at the umwa office in fairmont, he asked: “you can train a guy to be a truck driver, but what’s he going to haul? coal miners don’t want unemployment. they want work.” still, on thursday, at his farm in grafton, democratic former state legislator mike manypenny was firm that enthusiasm for sanders is big and getting bigger. manypenny, one of the many casualties of a 2014 republican sweep, is running for congress on the theory that the progressive politics he shares with sanders — a living wage, the return of glass-steagall’s repealed restrictions on banks — are the way to break the conservative grip on voters’ imaginations. “the problem last year was that everybody focused on getting the vote out from the historic democratic voters,” he explained. “those are the seniors — i don’t need to tell you that each year you lose a little more of them. this is something new. barring anything happening in the democratic debate, like bernie stumbling badly, i don’t see anything changing the momentum. i think he wins.”",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.723333333333333,8.133333333333335,0.08333333333333333,0.0

wife of vanished british lord at heart of murder mystery found dead,"london (reuters) - the wife of british aristocrat lord lucan, who vanished without trace 43 years ago after the murder of his children s nanny, has been found dead, london police said on wednesday. the mystery of what happened to richard lucan, a dapper, moustachioed lord known as lucky , has fascinated the public for decades and speculation about his whereabouts has long been a staple of the british press. lord lucan disappeared hours after nanny sandra rivett was found bludgeoned to death in his house in central london in 1974. a car he was using was later found on the south english coast with a length of lead piping. it was alleged the peer had mistaken the nanny for his estranged wife veronica, who was also attacked and fled to a nearby pub covered in blood to raise the alarm. she later identified her husband as the assailant. police said on wednesday they had found the body of 80-year-old lady lucan after forcing entry to a house in the upmarket belgravia area of london. the death is being treated as unexplained but is not believed to be suspicious, police said. over the years, the british press have reported supposed sightings of lord lucan across the world, including in australia, india, the netherlands and south africa but his relatives believe him to be dead. the london high court declared him dead in 1999 and last year a judge issued a death certificate allowing his son george bingham to inherit his title. my own personal view, and it was one i took i think as an eight-year-old boy, is he s unfortunately been dead since that time (of his disappearance), bingham said last year. one of numerous theories about what became of lucan, who would now be 82, was that he shot himself and was then fed to tigers at the zoo of his friend john aspinall. aspinall himself said in 2000 that lucan had weighted himself down with a stone and drowned himself in the english channel.",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.806666666666668,8.133333333333335,0.08333333333333333,0.0
peru's business community sours on kuczynski: survey,"paracas, peru (reuters) - support from business leaders for peru s president pedro pablo kuczynski has plummeted, a survey showed, as he spars with an opposition-controlled congress and struggles to revive economic growth. the survey by ipsos peru, taken at a business forum in paracas to the south of lima last week and released late on friday, showed participants approval for kuczynski fell to 37 percent from 89 percent a year earlier at a similar event. kuczynski took office in july 2016 promising to modernize peru and strengthen its economy with solid backing from lima s business elite after a tight runoff election against right-wing populist keiko fujimori. but the 79-year-old former investment banker s first year in power was hampered by congress, which is dominated by fujimori s popular force party and voted to oust his cabinet in september. meanwhile economic growth in what was once one of latin america s fastest growing economies slowed after heavy flooding and a corruption scandal involving brazilian builder odebrecht stalled investment in public works projects. the economy and politics cannot continue on separate lines, their progress is interdependent and deficiencies in politics and institutions can block the path of our development, the president of the business forum, drago kisic, told reporters. peru s central bank president julio velarde also warned during the event that the clashes between the government and congress could hinder growth in the future, saying the finance ministry had lost influence over the legislature. it is absolutely necessary in the long term that there be a better consensus among political forces in terms of agreeing on the essential elements to underpin growth, he said. finance minister claudia cooper said on friday peru s economy could grow more than 4 percent in 2018, up from 2.8 percent expected in 2017, if private investment in the metals exporting nation recovered. the ipsos survey showed that among hundreds attending peru s best known business forum, disapproval with kuczynski had risen to 63 percent from 11 percent a year earlier. closing the conference on friday, kuczynski defended his government and called on attendees and congress to unite in a fight against populism. i want to ask you to speak out more clearly about the challenges that we are facing politically, this is a determined government, not a confrontational one, he said.",0,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,14.111428571428572,14.228571428571428,0.0,0.0
the “american conservative movement” has ended. the american right goes on.,"here's something interesting from the unz review... recipient name => horatius defends the bridge at rome. credit: vdare.com. vdare.com editor peter brimelow writes: i spoke at the h.l. mencken club conference in baltimore last saturday, november 5. it seems like a thousand years ago. subject: “the right and american conservatism.” reading the transcript, i see it’s almost as f i thought donald j. trump might lose the november 8 election . silly me. [see also: america`s egalitarian temptation—stalinism`s unquiet ghost , peter brimelow’s address to the 2008 inaugural meeting of the h. l. mencken club]. peter brimelow: ladies and gentlemen: some of you may recall i gave the banquet address at the h.l. mencken club last november. it’s been lost to history because (to my intense rage!) h.l, mencken club chairman paul gottfried didn’t have it recorded. in it, i praised ann coulter’s great book adios america! , which came to the same conclusions about immigration (moratorium, sealed borders, attrition through enforcement etc.) that i had in alien nation 20 years earlier. and a questioner said: “why is she doing this? why is she taking this risk?” and i said: “well, look on the bright side, maybe trump will win.” there was sort of a shocked silence, as i recall. [ laughter ] this was before the primaries had even begun. i was pretty shocked at the idea myself! but, you know, he’s come very close . he’s come very close. the moral of this is: we should not give into despair. amazing things happen—completely unexpectedly. the subject i’ve got now from paul is: “the right and american conservatism.” and i think it’s right that we should use the term “american conservatism” because it’s on the point at becoming a term of art. it represented a specific intellectual eddy , which came into existence relatively recently. i don’t know how widely the term “conservatism” was used in american politics prior to 1950s —paul, do you? paul gottfried: it was not used often at all. robert taft described himself as a “liberal.” pb: right. in britain, of course, it didn’t exist at all before the 1840s. anyway, the american conservative movement came into existence in the 1950s—and now it’s ended. i may say i immigrated to the american conservative movement. i discovered it when i was at university in england in the late 1960s, reading national review, which we found in great bundles in the history basement of the university of sussex library . they had discontinued their subscription —because they thought national review was irrelevant and pointless. we of course were fascinated by the fact that there’d been a story on the cover proposing that the americans nuke china, which struck us as very enterprising, the sort of initiative that was unthinkable in the british political context. [ january 12, 1965 ] so we made them re-subscribe. and i’m not one of these people that thinks the american conservative movement did not achieve anything. it ended in failure, as all political movements do. but it did win the cold war and that’s really significant. some of you are old enough to remember the despair that prevailed in the mid1970s after the fall of vietnam. and we had reason to despair. american society and american politics was riddled with no-goodniks who absolutely planned to staff the gulags after the soviets arrived. absolutely planned to do that. and, of course, now they’ve simply mutated into cultural marxists. they’re still planning to staff the gulags. i was talking to paul [gottfried] a little earlier about tom fleming, our mutual friend, who was the long-time editor of the chronicles . he’s a sort of wayward genius and i have learned to respect him because he told me more than 20 years ago that the great lawrence auster , the blogger , was in effect “mad, bad, and dangerous to know,” to use lady caroline lamb’s description of lord byron. and he was understating the matter, although i do think larry was a great man and we’ve missed him sorely in the immigration wars. and tom also said about 20 years ago that we had to give up the term “conservatism”—because it had been co-opted by, basically, corporate lobbyists and rent-seekers. i didn’t like this at all because i thought “conservatism” was one of our very few—but there are a few—victories in the culture. another one, for example, is the idea of political correctness. everyone knows what political correctness is. it’s not that the cultural marxists wanted us to know, it’s just that somehow it made it to the front. we saw romney describe himself in one of the 2012 primary debates as “ severely conservative .” now, of course, he’s not conservative at all, and he doesn’t strike me as particularly severe, he strikes me a rather a wimp as a matter of fact. but he felt obliged to say this because of the power that the word has achieved in the culture. so, i was kind of sorry to give it up. but i’m afraid that we are going to have to. a few years ago, i learned with delight that the indian army has inscribed, on the monument erected in tawang province to its soldiers who fell in the 1962 border war with china, now completely forgotten, the famous lines from the lays of ancient rome by lord macaulay—also now completely forgotten: and how can man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods? it`s always seemed to me that macaulay`s verse is a litmus test for conservatism—or perhaps i should more accurately say, the right. it either it speaks to you or it doesn`t. it`s vital to note that this verse is not vainglorious and chest-thumping, but somber and stoic. the scene, of course, is that horatius is about to make a stand on the bridge to stop the storming of rome by lars porsena and the deposed king of rome, tarquin the proud. the previous lines are: then up spake brave horatius the captain of the gate: “to every man upon this earth death cometh soon or late…” in other words, horatius` point is not that death facing fearful odds is so wonderful—but that there is no wonderful alternative. so why not? note also that macaulay has horatio fight for “ashes” and “temples”—that is, not in the hope of saving any living family members, or in the service of any gods in whom he has confident faith. the implication: he could have no family members and no hope of divine providence—but his death in battle would still have symbolic resonance. the core of conservatism, it seems to me, is this recognition and acceptance of the elemental emotions. conservatism understands that it is futile to debate the feelings of the mother for her child—or such human instincts as the bonds of tribe , nation , even race . of course, all are painfully vulnerable to deconstruction by rationalistic intellectuals—but not, ultimately, to destruction. these commitments are jungian rather than freudian, not irrational but a-rational—beyond the reach of reason. this is one of the problems, by the way, with the american conservative movement. i was completely astonished when it fell apart at the end of the cold war—i never thought it would. that’s because i assumed that everybody realized that america standing up to the soviet union was, in some sense, a nationalist resistance. americans just didn’t want to be conquered by russians. but, it turned out that there were people who had joined the anti-communist coalition who harbored messianic fantasies about “global democracy” and and america as the first “universal nation” (i.e. polity. nation-states must have a specific ethnic core.) they also had uses for the american military which hadn’t occurred to me. but they didn’t care about america—about america as a nation-state, the political expression of a particular people, the historic american nation. in fact, in some cases, it made them feel uneasy. i thought about this this spring when trump was debating in new hampshire. abc’s john muir asked three candidates: “what does it mean to be conservative?” i’m going to quote from john kasich: blah, blah, blah, blah. balanced budgets—tax cuts—jobs—“but once we have economic growth i believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows.” by this he meant, not illegal aliens, although he did favor amnesty , but “the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor…[and] our friends in the minority community.” that’s because the republican party has lots of friends in the minority community. marco rubio said: …it’s about three things. the first is conservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal level…it’s about free enterprise…and it’s about a strong national defense. it’s about believing, unlike barack obama, that the world is a safer and a better place when america is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet. that’s conservatism. kasich and rubio’s answers, of course, are not remotely “conservative” but utilitarian, economistic, classical liberal. note that rubio even felt obliged to justify “strong national defense” in universalistic, wilsonian terms: it will make the world “a safer and a better place.” in contrast to all that, donald trump said: i view the word conservative as a derivative of the word conserve. we want to converse our money. we want to conserve our wealth…we want to conserve our country. we want to save our country. now, this caused a considerable amount of harrumphing among conservative inc. intellectuals and various republican politicians. somebody called john hart , who writes a thing called opportunity lives —has anybody heard of it? it’s a very well-funded libertarianism inc. website in washington. nobody has heard of it? good. hart said: trump’s answer may have been how conservatives described themselves once: in 1957. but today’s modern conservative movement isn’t a hoarding or protectionist philosophy. conservatism isn’t about conserving; it’s about growth. “growth”? well, i don’t think so. and not just because i remember 1957 . as i said, i think it turned out that american conservatism was just a transitional phase. and now it’s over. why did it end? after buckley purged john o’sullivan and all of us immigration patriots from national review in 1997, we spent a lot of time thinking about why he had done this. and there were a lot of complicated psychological explanations: bill was getting old, he was jealous of his successor, the new editor, john o’sullivan, he was terrified of the neoconservatives who didn’t like the emphasis on immigration because of their own ethnic agenda, and he was very inclined to listen to the congressional republicans, who didn’t want to talk about immigration because they are terrified too—because they are cowards, basically—and also because they have big corporate donors . and, i think that is part of the explanation. but there was a similar discussion in the 1950s and 1960s, which i’m old enough to remember, about why the old bolsheviks all testified against themselves in the treason trials during stalin’s great purge . they all admitted to the most fantastic things—that they had been spies for the americans and the british and the capitalist imperialists all along, that they’d plotted to assassinate comrade stalin. and there were all kinds of discussions as to why this was, and in fact a wonderful novel, darkness at noon [ pdf ] by arthur koestler , one of the most remarkable novels in the last century, describing the exquisite psychological process by which an old bolshevik in prison came to the conclusion that he was going to have to say all these things in the long-term interest of the revolution. do you agree about darkness at noon , paul? [ paul gottfried indicates assent ] good. well, when nikita khrushchev got up and denounced stalin in at the party conference in 1956, he was asked about this. why did all these old bolsheviks turn turtle like this? and his answer was: “beat, beat, beat.” in other words, there is no complex psychological explanation : they were just tortured. i think that goes to what happened to the american conservative movement. it wasn’t tortured; it was bought . it was simply bought . i think the dominance of the donorist class and the donorist party is one of the things that has emerged analytically within the past 10 years. when i was first writing about american politics and got involved in american politics–and i started by working for john ashbrook (not ashcroft , ash brook ) against nixon in 1972 –nobody thought about donors. we have only gradually become conscious of them. and their absolute dominant role, and their ability to prohibit policy discussions, has really only become clear in the last five to ten years. i think, in retrospect, with buckley , who subsidized his lifestyle out of the national review to a scandalous extent, that there was some financial transaction. i think that now. it’s an open secret that rich lowry did not want to come out and with this anti-trump issue that they published earlier this year, but he was compelled to do it. that’s not the type of thing that lowry would normally do. he wouldn’t take that kind of risk, he’s a courtier, he would never take the risk of not being invited to ride in trump’s limousine in the case that trump won. but, apparently, someone forced him to do it. and i think that someone was a donor and i think i know who it was. so i think that is the reason for the end of the american conservative movement. it really goes back to what eric hoffer said: “every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket .” it’s a racket. but the good news is, as john derbyshire said a few minutes ago, that ultimately conservatism—or rightism— is a personality type. it underlies politics and it will crop up again—just as, to our astonishment, donald trump has cropped up. so, i guess my bottom line here is: “ don’t despair .” peter brimelow [ ] is the editor of vdare.com. his best-selling book, alien nation: common sense about america’s immigration disaster , is now available in kindle format.

two palestinians killed in anti-us protests after u.n. vote on jerusalem-gaza ministry,"gaza (reuters) - israeli troops shot dead at least two palestinians and wounded about 60 with live fire on friday, the health ministry in gaza said, as protests intensified against washington s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital. a u.n. general assembly resolution passed on thursday, rejecting u.s. president donald trump s dec. 6 jerusalem declaration, did little to calm palestinian anger over his reversal of decades-old u.s. policy on the contested holy city. instead, thousands of palestinian protesters, many of them throwing rocks, confronted israeli security forces along the gaza border fence, in all of occupied west bank s seven cities and in east jerusalem. in bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of jesus, smoke from burning tires billowed in the street, just two days before christmas celebrations. israeli gunfire killed two palestinians in a confrontation in the southern gaza strip, a spokesman for the palestinian health ministry said, putting the number of wounded at 120, half of them shot with live ammunition and the rest struck by rubber bullets or hit by tear gas canisters. in a statement, the israeli military said some 2,000 palestinians had faced off against the troops at the gaza border fence. it said the crowd threw stones and rolled burning tires at soldiers, who responded with riot dispersal measures and fired live rounds selectively towards main instigators . protesters chanted trump is a coward. trump is a fool . among the wounded was a man dressed as santa claus. palestinian health officials said at least one palestinian suffered a live bullet wound in the west bank and some 30 protesters were hit by rubber bullets. the military, putting the number of demonstrators at about 1,700 and the injured at six, said troops faced firebombs, rocks and burning tires. the protests died down after sunset. demonstrations have been held daily since trump s announcement. palestinian president mahmoud abbas, in a christmas message, called the u.s. leader s move an insult to millions of people worldwide, and also to the city of jerusalem . israel considers jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital. palestinians want the capital of an independent palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. most countries regard the status of jerusalem as a matter to be settled in an eventual israeli-palestinian peace agreement, although that process is now stalled. a total of 128 countries voted for the u.n. resolution. nine opposed it and 35 abstained. twenty-one countries did not cast a vote. sami abu zuhri, a spokesman for gaza s dominant hamas islamists, called the u.n. vote a defeat for trump, while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected the resolution as preposterous and branded the u.n. a house of lies . but michael oren, israel s deputy minister for diplomacy, seemed to play down the support for the resolution shown by many countries israel considers friends. we have an interest in tightening our bilateral relations with a long list of countries in the world, and expect and hope that one day, they will vote with us, or for us in the united nations, oren said on tel aviv radio station 102 fm. but i am not prepared to suspend all cooperation with important countries, such as india, he said. netanyahu, who hosted indian prime minister narendra modi in july, is due to visit new delhi next month. friday s deaths in gaza raised to 10 the number of palestinians killed by israeli gunfire since dec. 6, palestinian health officials said. gaza militants have also fired rockets into israel, and two gunmen were killed in an israeli air strike after one such attack. there have been no israeli fatalities or significant injuries. amnesty international on friday called on israeli authorities to stop using excessive force . the fact that live ammunition has been used during protests in gaza and the west bank is particularly shocking, it said. in the run-up to the u.n. vote, trump threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that supported the resolution. his warning appeared to have some impact, with more countries abstaining and rejecting the document than usually associated with palestinian-related resolutions. but most of the european union, israel s biggest trading partner, and countries such as greece, cyprus and india, with which netanyahu has pursued closer relations and economic ties, backed the resolution. i prefer we have tight bilateral relations over a situation in which we don t have close bilateral relations, and they vote in our favor in the united nations, oren said, describing india s vote as certainly disappointing .",0,12,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.400000000000002,9.066666666666668,0.08333333333333333,0.0
watch: anderson cooper humiliates trump supporter for whining about jay-z at hillary rally,"anderson cooper only needed a single sentence to put a trump supporter to shame.during a panel discussion at a hillary clinton campaign rally in philadelphia, which featured a performance by bruce springsteen, the cnn host listened as trump minions jeffrey lord and kayleigh mcenany whined and complained.lord got the whine party started by claiming that most people in the crowd at hillary s rally are only there to see springsteen while trump s audience is only at his rallies to see trump.lord then shifted to talking about michelle obama and how trump s past statements about grabbing women by the p*ssy caused her to get more involved in the election, which lord claims makes her a hypocrite because she likes jay-z and beyonce. one of the things that got her interested in this all of a sudden was that access hollywood tape, in which the p-word was mentioned, lord said. and yet there is hillary clinton with jay-z who has a song, specifically titled with the p-word. cooper responded by pointing out that jay-z is not running for president. it should also be noted that jay-z was not singing about sexually assaulting women, which is exactly what trump was bragging about on that bus.still, lord claimed that michelle obama and hillary clinton are hypocrites, and mcenany agreed. the difference is for jay-z to shout these expletives on a stage at a political rally while the democrats are trying to stand on a moral high ground saying we re better than that and hillary clinton is putting out commercials with little girls looking in the mirror, she said.but cooper was ready for that and promptly humiliated her by pointing out something that a conservative musician did at a recent trump rally. ted nugent grabbed his package at his concert, didn t he? cooper asked as mcenany sat in stunned silence for a couple seconds.here s the video via vidme.trump supporters will literally say anything to criticize hillary clinton. their attacks are nothing more than petty jealousy because their candidate is so embarrassingly bad.but at least we have anderson cooper to call them out and smack them down when necessary.featured image via screenshot",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,13.080000000000002,17.50769230769231,0.0,0.0

another clinton casualty? activist murdered after openly blaming hillary for meddling role in honduran coup [video],"when far left publications like democracy now and global research start questioning hillary s involvement in the murder of honduran environmental activist, berta c ceres, there is probably good reason to look a little deeper into the controversy. former secretary of state hillary clinton is facing a new round of questions about her handling of the 2009 coup in honduras that ousted democratically elected president manuel zelaya. since the coup, honduras has become one of the most violent places in the world. last week, indigenous environmental activist berta c ceres was assassinated in her home.before her murder on march 3, berta c ceres, a honduran indigenous rights and environmental activist, named hillary clinton, holding her responsible for legitimating the 2009 coup. we warned that this would be very dangerous, she said, referring to clinton s effort to impose elections that would consolidate the power of murderers.berta c ceres was an award-winning land activist, a leader in her community and a mother of four. she was shot four times while in bed, at 1am on 2 march. as a founding member of the civic council of indigenous and popular organizations of honduras (copinh), c ceres fought against logging, hydro-power and mining projects threatening indigenous people in honduras. her death has exposed the poor judgement of impact investor bank fmo, the bully tactics of mining corporations, and murky situations from clinton s time as secretary of state. we re coming out of a coup that we can t put behind us. we can t reverse it, c ceres said. it just kept going. and after, there was the issue of the elections. the same hillary clinton, in her book, hard choices, practically said what was going to happen in honduras. via: democracy nowthe military coup in 2009 did nothing to protect honduran land or people. president manuel zelaya had moved towards grassroots social movements, the kinds of social reforms that the united states has always opposed (chomsky), and deals with venezuela. the military kidnapped president zelaya at gunpoint and flew him out of the country in his pyjamas. this was certainly a coup d etat and was defined as such by the un, the eu and other latin america nations and dictionaries everywhere.as obama s secretary of state, clinton refused to call what had happened a coup in public. doing so would have automatically cut off us non-humanitarian aid to honduras. members of clinton s own party wrote to barak obama about the outrage. but hillary did not relent, despite being informed that the coup question was an open and shut case in us embassy cables.in a video interview, given in buenos aires in 2014, c ceres says it was clinton who helped legitimate and institutionalize the coup. in response to a question about the exhaustion of the opposition movement (to restore democracy), c ceres says (around 6:10): the same hillary clinton, in her book hard choices, practically said what was going to happen in honduras. this demonstrates the bad legacy of north american influence in our country. the return of mel zelaya to the presidency (that is, to his constitutionally elected position) was turned into a secondary concern. there were going to be elections. clinton, in her position as secretary of state, pressured (as her emails show) other countries to agree to sideline the demands of c ceres and others that zelaya be returned to power. instead, clinton pushed for the election of what she calls in hard choices a unity government. but c ceres says: we warned that this would be very dangerous. the elections took place under intense militarism, and enormous fraud. the clinton-brokered election did indeed install and legitimate a militarized regime based on repression. in the interview, c ceres says that clinton s coup-government, under pressure from washington, passed terrorist and intelligence laws that criminalized political protest. c ceres called it counterinsurgency, carried out on behalf of international capital mostly resource extractors that has terrorized the population, murdering political activists by the high hundreds. every day, c ceres said elsewhere, people are killed. interestingly, hillary clinton removed the most damning sentences regarding her role in legitimating the honduran coup from the paperback edition of hard choices.according to bel n fern ndez, clinton airbrushed out of her account exactly the passage c ceres highlights for criticism: we strategized on a plan to restore order in honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of zelaya moot and give the honduran people a chance to choose their own future (see fern ndez s essay in liza featherstone s excellent false choices: the faux feminism of hillary rodham clinton).aside from hard choices shape-shifting account of the crisis, clinton has ignored criticism of her role in enabling the consolidation of the honduran coup. that is, until c ceres s murder forced a response. last week, her campaign answered my nation post on her broader responsibility for c ceres s execution: simply nonsense, a spokesperson said: hillary clinton engaged in active diplomacy that resolved a constitutional crisis and paved the way for legitimate democratic elections. we still don t have a clear idea of the events surrounding c ceres s murder. there is one witness, gustavo castro, a mexican national, activist, and journalist, who was with c ceres when gunmen burst into her bedroom. berta died in his arms. castro was himself shot twice, but survived by playing dead.the honduran government that unity government clinton is proud of has castro in lockdown, refusing him contact with the outside world. via: the nationin clinton s memoir, she admits thatin the subsequent days [after the coup] i spoke with my counterparts around the hemisphere, including secretary [patricia] espinosa in mexico we strategized on a plan to restore order in honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of zelaya moot.clinton s emails revealed that she played a crucial role, delaying any action that could quickly restore zelaya.grahame russell from rights action is not alone in describing the coup as us and canadian-backed . media lens has bemoaned the under-reporting of hillary clinton s connection to the state of affairs in honduras in the us print media, as has fair. but it is online. the nation ran an article titled, the clinton-backed honduran regime is picking-off indigenous leaders the day after c ceres murder.the clintons have a great ally in canadian billionaire frank giustra. along with media outlets, giustra has gold mining interests in africa. he is known in the industry as a mining promoter and presumably connects investors and miners. although bill and frank like to fly around latin america, and do philanthropic work together, bill did bump into frank in kazakhstan when frank was doing a spot of uranium shopping.the clintons connection with the canadian mining magnate is labeled a threat to her campaign by bloomberg politics. certainly, the clintons ties to big business have dogged her campaign, and many democrats are uncomfortable with her performance as secretary of state. revelations about the clinton foundation do little to dispel the image of hillary as an entrenched member of the establishment let alone the oligarch hegemony. given that her nomination looks increasingly insecure, c ceres murder is untimely for them both. via: global

how trump is accelerating the decline of us global influence,"it should also be said that the current us administration is merely finishing the job which started under three consecutive two-term presidents; bill clinton, george w. bush, and barack obama something to bear in mind as trump ends his first year in office.this new year, let us not forget who re-ignited the middle east crisis, with the consecutive sackings of libya and syria the ""moderate rebel"" terrorists in syria certainly miss you barack, you were so generous to all of them. patrick henningsen (@21wire) december 29, 2017while make america great again might be the political campaign de jour at home, these next four years are likely to coincide with an overall decline in us influence in the world.mehr news reports during the past decades after world warii and disintegration of the former soviet union and the end of the cold war, the world has been dominated by the us in terms of politics, military and economy. but the rising of new world powers at the end of the 20th century and beginning of 21st century has challenged the us global domination. washington s challenges with the new multipolar world order in recent years has resulted in the decline of us influence in the world, which is expected to be accelerated withtrump s term in white house.recognizing al-quds (jerusalem) as israeli regime s capital by trump created lots of negative reaction and resulted in a resolution by the un general assembly despite the us threats is a clear example of declining us global influence.decline of us domination over world trade and financial regimesafter the end of world warii until 1960, the us held 40 percent of the world economy but after the rise of new economic powers like china, japan and eu, in 2013 the us just held 25 percent of the world economy. considering the recent decisions made by trump to withdraw from tpp and nafta and tensions with eu, more decline is expected in near future.the dollar dominated global financial, trade and banking regimes until the beginning of 21th century. the first blow to the dollar global stand was inflicted in 1999 when euro appeared as official currency of the eu. in recent years rise of chinese renminbi has inflicted more blows to the dollar global stand, so that in 2015 only 50 to 60 percent of world trades and transactions were done in dollar, according to eu central bank.during the past years, us sanctions against some countries like russia, iran and white house pressure on other countries to avoid transaction with these sanctioned countries, has resulted in some agreements between states to do their business in their own national currencies instead of dollar like the agreements between iran, russia, turkey and china. continuation of such agreements and trend will definitely lead to further decline of dollar global stand in future.decline of the us strategic importance in terms of politics and militarytrump s serious pressure on nato the most important strategic achievement of the us till now with member states to pay more for the costs of the alliance, has inflicted serious damages to the solidarity of the member states and has created many doubts so that some us old european allies are seriously after formation of a european army.us inability to solve south korea s missile and nuclear program issues despite trump s rhetoric and bluffs, us inability to materialize its regional policy and plans in the middle east to change the map of the region to the benefit of its own strategic interest and israel s due to close cooperation of iran, russia, turkey, iraq and syria all these us failures and its wrong policies which have even forced some of its old regional allies like turkey to recalibrate its relation and cooperation with white house in the region shows the us limitations and incapability resulting in increasing decline of washington s influence.also the us inability to settle the issues in east of ukraine and crimea as its european allies expected has been a serious blow to its strategic stand among the washington s european allies, and even worse nowadays as some of the europeans consider us measures in east europe as a blackmailing to gain the energy market of the europeduring the last one year in office, trump s moves to withdraw from paris climate change accord, tpp, his wrong approach toward the nuclear deal with iran (jcpoa), his insatiable immigration policy which has resulted in significant reduction in the number of foreign students in us for the first time, and finally his partial recognition of al-quds as israeli regime s capital all have inflicted serious blows to global credibility and influence of the country which cannot be at least mended in short-term.read more trump news at: 21st century wire trump filessupport 21wire subscribe & become a member @21wire.tv",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.55,12.0,0.0,0.0
"james bond wouldn’t make the grade in modern mi6, says britain’s top spy","james bond wouldn’t make the grade in modern mi6, says britain’s top... james bond wouldn’t make the grade in modern mi6, says britain’s top spy by 0 41 fictional super-spy james bond’s lack of a moral compass would quickly rule him out of the intelligence services today, the head of mi6 said in a rare public statement. in a question-and-answer session for the black history month website, spy chief alex younger said 007’s lack of an ethical core would have seen him rejected from training. “ we know that if we undermine british values, even in the name of defending them, then we have failed. our staff are not from another planet ,” younger said. “ they are ordinary men and women operating in the face of complex moral, ethical and physical challenges, often in the most forbidding environments on earth .” read more “ in contrast to james bond, mi6 officers are not for taking moral shortcuts. in fact, a strong ethical core is one of the first qualities we look for in our staff, ” he added. younger insisted that bond’s erratic individualism would certainly have rendered him unable to “get through our recruitment process.” “ whilst we share his qualities of patriotism, energy and tenacity, an intelligence officer in the real mi6 has a high degree of emotional intelligence, values teamwork and always has respect for the law… unlike mr. bond, ” younger said. some, however, would contest claims that mi6 is a bastion of ethical conduct, not least during the uk’s heavy involvement in kidnap and torture in the post-9/11 world. a libyan kidnapped and delivered to the libyan regime for torture recently questioned the commitment to morality of a previous mi6 head. in july, abdul hakim belhaj said former mi6 chief mark allen was mistaken if he thinks a recent article he wrote for a christian magazine means his “account is settled with god.” in 2004, abdul hakim belhaj was kidnapped in hong kong with british complicity, along with his pregnant wife, and rendered back to his native libya. he was then held and tortured by the regime of colonel muammar gaddafi for six years. a note faxed from allen to the libyan authorities told the regime’s spy chief moussa koussa: “ i congratulate you on the safe arrival of… the air cargo. ” on august 4, a day before the crown prosecution service (cps) decided it would not press charges against allen, the ex-spook published a piece in the catholic herald on “ christian ” approaches to terrorism. belhaj’s response, which had been offered to the herald, was published on the website of the reprieve human rights charity. “ his words on the power of faith to see us through bloodshed are too rich to swallow, ” the torture victim wrote in reference to the now infamous ‘ air cargo ’ fax. via rt . this piece was reprinted by rinf alternative news with permission or license.",1,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,4.003076923076925,5.2,0.0,0.07692307692307693

say what? obama gives go ahead for new un “regional hub” in washington dc…what they plan to use center for is disturbing,"if seven years ago, someone told americans that the un would be allowed to place a regional hub in our nations capitol, they would have been dismissed as a tin foil conspiracy theorist. but then, who would ve imagined that it was possible we d have an anti-american community organizer as the president of our united states of america?exclusive: the chief united nations human rights agency, with the obama administration s apparent blessing, is creating a new regional hub for itself in washington, to use as a center for organizing against the death penalty, among other things, and for affecting the legal frameworks, policies, and strategies of american counterterrorism.in a management plan covering its activities through 2017, the agency, known as the office of the high commissioner for human rights, or ohchr, puts the u.s. in the same category for that counterterrorism alignment effort as countries like iraq and uganda.the fast-tracked human rights hub also has a number of more nebulous thematic objectives for the u.s., which include, according to an ohchr information document, the establishment of national participatory bodies for reporting and implementing recommendations of human rights mechanisms and the aim of widening the democratic space with the aid of undefined national human rights institutions. it may also involve, as ohchr notes in its management plan, increasing advocacy for ratification of human rights treaties and withdrawal of treaty reservations meaning exceptional carve-outs that nations including those like the u.s., with a federal division of power can make to limit their acceptance of international agreements.in the case of the death penalty, for example, u.s. refusal to join in a u.n- sponsored global moratorium is based on the fact that such criminal justice measures also are the responsibilities of individual states.nonetheless, as ohchr s management plan notes, in addition to global efforts to abolish the death penalty by 2017, ohchr expects to have contributed to a moratorium on the application of the death penalty or pending a moratorium, increased compliance with relevant international human rights obligations in countries such as iraq, kenya, liberia, libya, palestine, papua new guinea, somalia, south sudan, the united states of america and other countries in asia and the americas. the ohchr puts the u.s. in the same category for its counterterrorism alignment effort as countries like iraq and uganda.all of those themes, along with ohchr s view of itself as the principal advocate for human rights within the u.n. system, seem likely to bring the u.s. into closer proximity to the u.n. s tangled, proliferating and often sweepingly contradictory notions of international human rights law and also, perhaps, to the notoriously dictatorship-riddled, 47-member u.n. human rights council.among other things, the council, which has been far more enthusiastic about condemning alleged human rights transgressions in israel than in any other nation, creates mandates for ohchr, which also serves as the council s bureaucratic support.the obama administration reversed the policies of george w. bush to join the council in 2009, and served consecutive three-year terms that ended last month, claiming victories during that time in focusing the council on gay rights and criticism of human rights practices in north korea and iran.while no longer on the council, the administration now seems comfortable with bringing the u.n. s human rights approach into closer contact with u.s. legislators, lobbyists, human rights activists and, perhaps most importantly, financial appropriators, before it leaves office at the end of next year.indeed, the ohchr hub which will cover not just the u.s. but north america and the english-speaking caribbean already has a warm advance welcome from the administration that also seems aimed at letting the new u.n. outpost arrive smoothly under washington s political radar.last month u.s. ambassador to the u.n. in geneva, pamela hamamoto, wrote to tell the aggressively expanding human rights body that it didn t need any additional legal agreement to establish the washington hub, complete with full legal privileges and immunities, since it already is covered by legal agreements for the u.n. headquarters in new york, where ohchr maintains a strong presence.if ohchr felt otherwise, hamamoto said on behalf of the administration, we would be happy to discuss alternative ways in which we might accommodate ohchr s specific requests. on the surface, the hub is part of a sweeping change initiative being promoted by the u.n. high commissioner, zeid ra ad al hussein, which aims at decentralizing the geneva-based organization, extending its outreach and human rights monitoring capability, and ostensibly improving its efficiency through, among other things, concentration on eight global hubs as focuses of activity.as it happens, the initiative is not that much of a change: six of the hubs already exist, including one in panama city for latin america. the only new ones are intended for washington and istanbul.according to zeid, the initiative would mostly involve the reshuffling of existing personnel shipping them away from geneva headquarters, where more than half of the agency s roughly 1,100 staff is located. zeid says that exercise, including the establishment of the new washington venue, would be revenue neutral. that assumption, however, was received skeptically by the u.n. s chief financial oversight committee, which called the calculation preliminary, and recommended against approving the restructuring until zeid came back with a clear and detailed proposal with a lot more detail.recommendations of the committee are usually adopted uncritically by the u.n. general assembly s fifth committee, which approves financial measures.but zeid has been lobbying the fifth committee energetically to break that tradition in his case in part because, as ohchr s fact sheet observes, the 2016-2017 budget that the advisory committee was assessing will cover the majority of the remainder of the high commissioner s [four-year] term of appointment. (zeid was appointed in 2014.)the issue came up in so-called informal meaning closed discussions of the fifth committee earlier this week. questions from fox news to zeid s spokesman about the discussions went unanswered.questions to the state department from fox news about the issue were referred to the u.s. mission to the u.n., headed by ambassador samantha power.questions from fox news to the mission about the discussion, and the overall u.s. government view of the hub, were not answered.beyond the fact that his career clock is ticking, another reason for zeid s gung-ho approach to the hub could be the possibility that no future u.s. president will be as enthusiastically multilateral as barack obama, giving a now-or-never urgency to the chance to bring the u.s. further under the u.n. human rights umbrella.and yet another reason might be that the reorganization could coincidentally help to bring down the curtain on a sensitive political problem for zeid.as part of the change initiative, he has announced that one of ohchr s important units, the field operations and technical cooperation division, which deals with human rights issues at the country level and also incorporates human rights observation of u.n. peacekeeping operations, will be disbanded in geneva and pieced off to the hubs.that division is headed by anders kompass, the senior human rights officer who kicked up a firestorm when he passed on an unredacted human rights report about alleged sexual abuse of children by non-u.n. peacekeepers in the central african republic to french authorities.for entire story: fox news",1,22,0.0,0,1,0,0.037037037037037035,10.153636363636362,16.072727272727274,0.0,0.0
ft. lauderdale terrorist says he carried out attack for islamic state,"esteban santiago ruiz told the fbi that he carried out an attack on fort lauderdale on behalf of the islamic state ( ) michael ferlazzo, an fbi special agent, reportedly testified at the attacker’s bond hearing tuesday. [santiago is the new iraq war veteran of puerto rican descent who killed five people and wounded six others at fort international airport in florida earlier this month. citing public records opened last week, sunshine state news adds that santiago converted to islam and created a “jihadist identity” for himself, assuming the islamic name aashiq hammad, prior to joining the u. s. army. he reportedly downloaded islamic terrorist propaganda and recorded muslim religious music online. however, the miami herald, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, reported that despite rumors to the contrary, nothing in santiago’s social media history suggests he was “an islamic convert inspired by terrorist organizations. ” on tuesday, the attacker was ordered held without bond. cnn notes that fbi agency ferlazzo “did not elaborate on whether santiago was purporting to be linked to isis or simply inspired by the terrorist organization. ” isis has not claimed responsibility for the attack. nevertheless, ferlazzo revealed that, during the interview conducted after the attack, santiago claimed “to be fighting for isis and that he’d been in touch with people via jihadi chat rooms who were planning attacks as well,” reports cnn. moreover, the “fbi agent confirmed that the 9 mm gun used in the jan. 6 shooting rampage at fort international airport is the same weapon anchorage, alaska, police seized and later returned to esteban santiago last year,” reports cbs news. “the agent also testified that santiago mentioned after the shooting that he was under government mind control. ” the terrorist has already been charged with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime performing a violent act against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury and killing a person with a firearm. of the charges, the latter two are punishable by death, while the first charge carries a maximum penalty of life behind bars. santiago revealed before the attack that he was hearing voices and that the cia had been controlling his mind, federal authorities and the killer’s brother bryan santiago have revealed. nearly a month prior to the attack, esteban santiago specifically confessed to the fbi in alaska where he was living at the time, that he was suffering from government mind control linked to isis videos. the fbi reportedly contacted law enforcement in anchorage and told them the veteran had been having “terroristic thoughts” and believed he was being influenced by isis. although authorities did take santiago to a mental facility, he was ultimately released along with his weapon. santiago has confessed to the mass shooting. “at tuesday’s hearing, the defense did not argue the prosecution’s assertion that santiago posed a flight risk, as well as a danger to the community, and said that the defendant was prepared to be detained throughout his trial,” reports cnn. “the judge ruled he be held without bond. his next court appearance is january 30. ”",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.08333333333333333,9.081818181818182,15.30909090909091,0.0,0.0

feds: dozens of muslim girls had genitals mutilated at michigan clinic…the landmark defense is shocking,"changing the name of something doesn t change the truth of what it is female genital mutilation is the name used for the secretive practice in the muslim world of making sure young girls never have a chance to feel sexual pleasure. it is a horrific practice of destroying the genitals of a girl to make sure she isn t promiscuous. a doctor in michigan was doing this under the radar on as many as 100 girls. we cannot accept this as a religious and cultural right as the lawyers for this doctor are trying to do. freedom of religion doesn t include the criminal act of mutilating a woman s genitals. this is what the lawyer said to defend this horrible practice: the defense has argued that the attars did not engage in any criminal act and that the procedure at issue is a protected religious rite-of-passage that involves no cutting, but rather a ***scraping of genital membrane. they also argued the attars are not a danger to the society and have no reason or desire to flee, convincing u.s. district judge bernard friedman to release them on bond.***the scraping comment is a lie. the girls were looked over by a doctor who said the injuries were far worse that first thought.here s the latest:a federal prosecutor dropped a bombshell in court wednesday, telling a federal judge that the government estimates that as many as 100 girls may have had their genitals cut at the hands of a local doctor and her cohorts.assistant u.s. attorney sara woodward disclosed the information while trying to convince a judge to keep a doctor and his wife locked up in the historic case. it involves allegations that two minnesota girls had their genitals cut at a livonia clinic in february as part of a religious rite of passage and were told to keep what happened a secret. due to the secretive nature of this procedure, we are unlikely to ever know how many children were cut by dr.

texas gives houston $50 million for hurricane harvey costs,"(reuters) - texas governor greg abbott on friday gave $50 million to houston to help cover costs related to hurricane harvey, a move the mayor said will allow the city to avoid a temporary property tax hike that was up for a city council vote in october. mayor sylvester turner, who accepted the money from the republican governor at a city hall press conference, said he will pull his proposal for a one-year tax increase to cover the city’s share of debris removal expenses and for insurance-related payments. parts of houston suffered severe wind and flood damage after hurricane harvey made landfall on aug. 25. it was the strongest hurricane to hit texas in more than 50 years. earlier this week, abbott rejected turner’s request for the state to immediately tap its $10 billion rainy day fund to aid its largest city. on friday, the governor said he had the flexibility to withdraw $50 million from a state disaster relief fund for houston. “this looked like the best solution at this point,” abbott told reporters. he added that once the state gets a handle on total hurricane expenses, the texas legislature will consider tapping into the rainy day fund when its next regular session begins in january 2019 or sooner in a special session.",0,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,7.58666666666667,8.044444444444444,0.0,0.0
ethics questions dogged agriculture nominee as georgia governor - the new york times,"washington — in sonny perdue’s telling, georgians were growing weary of the corruption and scandals in their state when he took over as governor in 2003 — a time when he gave his own version of a “drain the swamp” pledge. “my first goal as governor is to restore public trust in state government by changing the culture of state government,” mr. perdue told a leadership conference at kennesaw state university in april 2003. “our form of government depends on a mutual bond of trust between the people and their government. but people have become cynical about their government. ” but mr. perdue, a republican who is awaiting confirmation to serve as president trump’s agriculture secretary, became a target of frequent criticism that he was failing to honor his own ethics pledge during his eight years as governor. the criticism centers on the fact that, as mr. trump has, he continued to own or help run his family business ventures — four companies — while serving as governor. mr. perdue is one of the last cabinet members awaiting senate confirmation. no date has been set for his confirmation hearing a holdup in the release of paperwork accompanying his nomination by the federal office of government ethics has been blamed for the delay. the office must examine mr. perdue’s proposal to avoid conflicts of interest while running the u. s. d. a. as the department is known, which may include selling off some of his farming assets. before his tenure as governor ended in 2011, 13 complaints had been filed against mr. perdue with the state ethics commission, which on two occasions ruled that the governor had violated state ethics laws. the commission took the unusual step of fining mr. perdue while he was governor. there were numerous other questions, including some about the role of mr. perdue’s personal lawyer — also a state legislator — in pushing a bill through the legislature that included a special provision that gave mr. perdue $100, 000 in state tax relief. and, when his tenure as governor was coming to a close, mr. perdue met with georgia officials who oversee the state’s ports to discuss use of a terminal for a family business, according to documents obtained by the atlanta . soon after he left office, in fact, he opened a new company that specialized in exporting products through savannah. “when you are a public official you are supposed to be acting entirely on behalf of the public and not for ” said yasha heidari, former senior legal counsel to the state ethics commission. “looking at his record, as both an attorney and a citizen of the state, i had serious concerns. ” in a written statement, a spokeswoman for mr. perdue rejected that assessment, saying that the frequent criticism he faced while governor was largely politically motivated. “there hadn’t been a republican governor in georgia for 135 years,” the statement said. “governor perdue was the david who slew the democrats’ goliath. ” during the wait for mr. perdue’s confirmation hearing, some in the farming industry have come to his defense. “i don’t think you are going to find a man any more honorable than sonny perdue,” said zippy duvall, a georgia cattle and poultry farmer who is the president of the american farm bureau federation, adding that he had known mr. perdue for about a decade. “he is as ethical as they come. ” born into a family of farmers, mr. perdue played college football as a at the university of georgia, and later worked briefly as a practicing veterinarian. he rose through the ranks of the state legislature and, in the late 1990s, switched his party affiliation from democrat to republican because, he said, the state party had lost its focus on family values. one of mr. perdue’s first acts after he was sworn in as governor in january 2003 was to sign an executive order establishing a new code of ethics for executive branch employees. the order, which applied to the governor himself, prohibited state employees from using their powers for “any financial or other personal benefit” and barred them from taking any gifts worth more than $25. “in carrying out their official duties and obligations, all officers and employees of state government must work solely for the public good, striving vigilantly to avoid even the appearance that their actions are motivated by private or personal interest,” the 2003 executive order said. but mr. perdue ended up collecting at least $25, 000 worth of benefits or gifts during his years as governor, state records show. the gifts ranged from tickets to a nascar race and football games to flights paid for by altria, the tobacco company, and by csx, the railroad giant, according to a 2010 report by citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, a liberal nonprofit group. mr. perdue’s spokeswoman, in the written statement, said that none of these gifts violated the ban because the “trips were for official state business and were perfectly acceptable as saving taxpayer funds. ” “the gifts were to the state,” the statement read, “not to the governor. ” the fine by the state ethics commission in 2005 came after the commission concluded that mr. perdue had failed to properly report the use of an airplane owned by one of his family’s businesses for a trip. the commission also found that he had taken campaign contributions in amounts that exceeded state limits from several donors — including a political action committee run by suntrust, the bank. mr. perdue called the violations technical, and the investigation politically motivated. teddy lee, the executive secretary of the state ethics commission, was fired from his job in january 2006, and in an interview he blamed mr. perdue for his firing. mr. lee had served in the job under four governors. “this looked like a political hit to me,” mr. lee said. mr. lee’s dismissal came as mr. perdue was seeking and just months before his largest scandal emerged, over a $100, 000 state tax break he received thanks to a legislative maneuver engineered by a lawmaker who was also his personal lawyer. the focus of the controversy was a piece of property in florida that mr. perdue purchased in 2004. the purchase allowed him to defer paying federal capital gains taxes on a separate piece of georgia land — which he had previously sold at a profit. when that transaction was completed, mr. perdue still owed georgia about $100, 000 in state taxes. then, mr. perdue signed a bill the following year eliminating that state tax obligation — as state law was changed to allow rollover relief on capital gains, even if the new property being purchased was out of state. during deliberations on the legislation, larry o’neal, a member of the georgia house of representatives who also worked part time as a personal lawyer for mr. perdue, intervened to make the change in that provision retroactive. that meant it would cover mr. perdue’s 2004 land deal, saving the governor $100, 000, the reported at the time. mr. perdue’s spokeswoman said the change in state law was not intended to benefit mr. perdue. “it benefited all georgians,” the statement said. scott faber of the environmental working group, a nonprofit organization that keeps a close watch on policies at the agriculture department, said he had questions about mr. perdue’s fitness to take over the department. “given his record of and conflicts of interest as governor of georgia, it is fair to ask if he is fit to run a $ federal agency,” mr. faber said. but mr. duvall, of the american farm bureau federation, believes the opposite. mr. duvall said that as a former farmer, mr. perdue is just what the nation needs to run the department. “he has worked on a farm and owned businesses that buy and sell grain domestically and internationally,” mr. duvall said. “it ought to be a requirement that someone who runs the u. s. d. a. knows something about farming. and sonny certainly does. ”",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.723333333333333,14.8,0.0,0.0
nato confirms major troop buildup in eastern europe,"( antiwar ) a day after reports nato was soliciting even more ground troops for their deployment into eastern europe, officials are reporting “progress” in recruiting more troops from more member nations to participate in the deployment, intended to be around 40,000 troops along the baltic states, near russia’s border. nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg claimed to have been “ very inspired ” by the response of nations he sought troops from, after yesterday’s report quote: d diplomats as saying the deployment was meant to both “confront” russia and to undercut republican presidential nominee donald trump’s complaints nato isn’t participating enough in its own defense. the new participants in the deployment include albania, slovenia, luxembourg, the netherlands, croatia, belgium, and norway. the size of individual deployments from different nations is unclear, but there will be four battalions, and the us is expected to provide the majority. with all these troops headed to the baltic coast, reports out of russia’s media suggest that they are planning some new warship deployments into their baltic fleet, with an eye toward enhancing their targeting capacity along the shore.",1,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.180000000000003,3.2,0.0,0.0

u.s. taxpayers rush to claim deductions under threat from tax bill,"new york (reuters) - financial advisers and accountants are working overtime as many u.s. taxpayers scramble to pay the rest of their 2017 taxes before jan. 1 when the proposed republican tax overhaul would sharply cut the amount they can deduct on federal tax bills. the tax legislation, which top u.s. republicans said on sunday they expected congress to pass this week, caps the amount of state, local and property taxes individuals can deduct from their federal tax bills at $10,000. the average american who itemized his or her tax bill in 2015 claimed more than $27,000 in deductions. while taxpayers have until jan. 15 to pay the final installment of their 2017 taxes, tom holly of the accounting firm pwc said he received dozens of calls over the weekend from concerned clients eager to pay sooner. “it’s going to be a very busy holiday season for advisers,” said holly, who heads the firm’s wealth and asset management division. lisa featherngill, managing director of wealth planning at wells fargo’s abbot downing, said she was skipping a family trip to the valero alamo bowl football game in texas on dec. 28 in order to work. featherngill said wealthy clients and their accountants were not just trying to figure out if it makes sense to estimate and pay the rest of their 2017 itemized taxes this year, but also working to see if they should itemize at all. some taxpayers, particularly those in high-tax states who have income above $100,000, may end up paying the alternative minimum tax, which limits the deductions a person can take against his or her federal income tax. “people really have to run the numbers because ... if they are subject to alternative minimum tax, some of those taxes wouldn’t be deductible anyway,” said featherngill. last week, according to media reports, state officials in new york received calls from residents asking to pay their 2018 state, local and property taxes before jan. 1 in an effort to claim the higher amount of deductions before the republican tax bill takes effect. in response, the u.s. treasury department issued guidance over the weekend saying that any pre-payments for 2018 tax liabilities would not be deductible on federal tax bills. if passed, the tax bill would be the biggest u.s. tax rewrite since 1986. the legislation would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent but offer a mixed bag for individuals, including middle-class workers, by roughly doubling a standard deduction that does not require itemization, but eliminating or scaling back other popular itemized deductions and exemptions.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.863636363636363,11.672727272727274,0.0,0.0
three quarters of americans oppose gun control,"record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban steve a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures . the survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. the findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. the poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are “against” a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or “assault weapons”as the corporate media refers to them. that figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. in addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. in a summary of the new poll, gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a “paradox”: perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. these guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino, california, and orlando, and the mass shootings in aurora, colorado, and newtown, connecticut. the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clinton’s position on gun control is with the majority of americans. hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt–and eventually end–gun manufacturing in the united states. this article was posted: thursday, october 27, 2016 at 10:30 am share this article",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,9.054285714285715,8.514285714285714,0.0,0.0

fitton: documents confirm that obama irs improperly targeted conservatives - breitbart,"we continue to undercover the details of the obama irs’s arbitrary and capricious behavior toward those presumed to be “enemies” of president obama. [last week we released 695 pages of new documents containing admissions by irs officials that the agency used “inappropriate political labels” to screen the applications of conservative organizations. other records reveal that the irs was going to require 501( c)(4) nonprofit organizations to restrict their alleged political activities if they opted for “expedited consideration” of their applications. the documents were produced after a revelation by the irs that it had located “an additional 6, 924 documents of potentially responsive records” relating to a 2015 judicial watch freedom of information act (foia) lawsuit about the obama irs targeting scandal. these new records are the first batch of nearly 7, 000 documents that had been hidden from jw, congress, and the american people. (our foia lawsuit seeks records about the irs’ selection of individuals and organizations for audits based upon applications requesting nonprofit tax status filed by tea party and other 501( c)(4) organizations (judicial watch v. internal revenue service (no. 1: )). of the 695 pages of documents released by the irs, 422 (61 percent) were completely blacked out. again, this new material was not in the “congressional database,” which the irs created in 2013 to house records responsive to congressional inquiries into the irs scandal. nevertheless, we extracted some key info — such as a june 20, 2013, memo from karen schiller, director, eo (exempt organizations) rulings and agreements, suspending use of the controversial be on the lookout (bolo) and touch and go (tag) lists: eo rulings and agreements is undertaking a comprehensive review of screening and identification of critical issues. we intend to develop proper procedures and uses for these types of documents. until a more formal process for identification, approval and distribution of this type of data is established, rulings and agreements will not use this technique to elevate issues. in an august 9, 2013, memo, schiller admitted the irs used political labels in targeting the groups for special scrutiny and possible audit and that, going forward, the agency would screen organizations based only on their activities, “not words” or “labels of any kind:” as acting commissioner danny werfel has said, the irs has taken decisive action to eliminate the use of inappropriate political labels in the screening of 501( c)(4) applications. irs policy is now clear that screening is based on activity, not words in a name. the new steps and current policies were outlined in the june 24 report, which noted: “in the absence of bolo lists, the determinations unit will continue to screen for information affecting the determination of applications for tax exempt status, including activity tied to political campaign intervention, but it [will] be done without regard to specific labels of any kind. ” the report also reflects the june 20, 2013 memorandum, which was issued to officially suspend the use of the bolo list in the screening process. the documents also include a “dear [applicant]” letter that offers an “expedited process” for 501( c)(4) groups in exchange for restriction on their activities: this optional expedited process is currently available only to applicants for 501( c)(4) status with applications pending for more than 120 days as of may 28, 2013, that indicate the organization may be involved in political campaign intervention. in this optional process, an organization will represent that it satisfies, and will continue to satisfy, set percentages with respect to the level of its social welfare activities and political campaign intervention activities (as defined in the specific instructions on pages ). these percentage representations are not an interpretation of law but are a safe harbor for those organizations that choose to participate in the optional process. in short, the obama irs, after lawlessly delaying the approval of tea party group applications, tried to extort restrictions — which had no basis in law — on these very same groups. on september 30, 2013, acting director, exempt organizations, kenneth c. corbin, sent a memo to irs staff providing detailed guidance on classifying applications when “‘merit approval’ is not an option,” emphasizing that the determination is to be based on “facts and circumstances,” not “words and labels:” classifier reviews the application and determines if it should be routed to a specialty group. this determination is based upon facts and circumstances of the stated activities within part ii of the application rather than names or labels. this is consistent with karen schiller’s august 9, 2013 memorandum … the schiller and corbin memos came on the heels of the may 14, 2013, inspector general report revealing that the irs had singled out groups using terms such as “patriot” and “tea party” when applying for status. the ig probe determined that “early in calendar year 2010, the irs began using inappropriate criteria to identify organizations applying for status (e. g. lists of past and future donors)” and “delayed processing of targeted groups’ applications” in advance of the 2012 presidential election. no wonder the obama irs hid these records. these new documents contain admissions by the obama irs that it inappropriately targeted conservative groups. but the records also show that the abuse continued — as the obama irs tried to force conservative applicants to give up their first amendment rights in order to finally get their applications granted.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,21.349999999999998,32.0,0.0,0.0

flashback: evidence shows “crooked” hillary has been burying e-mails since she was first lady,"if anyone were to tell you 20 years ago that a career criminal, habitual liar and an enabler of husband who is a serial sexual offender was going to be a frontrunner for president of the united states in two decades simply because of her genitalia, would you have believed them?while the state department s own internal probe found former secretary hillary clinton violated federal recordkeeping laws, it s not the first time she and her top aides shielded her e-mail from public disclosure while serving in a government position.as first lady, hillary was embroiled in another scheme to bury sensitive white house e-mails, known internally as project x. in 1999, as investigators looked into whitewater, travelgate, filegate and other scandals involving the then-first lady, it was discovered that more than 1 million subpoenaed e-mails were mysteriously lost due to a glitch in a west wing computer server.the massive hole in white house archives covered a critical two-year period 1996 to 1998 when republicans and special prosecutor ken starr were subpoenaing white house e-mails.despite separate congressional investigations and a federal lawsuit over project x, high-level e-mails dealing with several scandals were never turned over. and the full scope of bill and hillary clintons culpability in the parade of scandals was never known.to those well-versed in clinton shenanigans, this all sounds distressingly familiar. thanks to another server-related problem, clinton so far has gotten away with withholding more than 30,000 e-mails from congressional committees investigating the benghazi terrorism cover-up, clinton foundation foreign-influence peddling and other scandals. this clinton e-mail scandal is nothing new, judicial watch president tom fitton told me. there were previous efforts to hide e-mails in the clinton white house. his washington watchdog group filed a lawsuit to recover the missing white house e-mails back then, just as it has against the state department now, though it has had better luck in this case.the parallels don t end there.during the project x e-mail scandal, career white house staffers and contractors found that someone close to the first lady had basically turned off the white house s automated e-mail-archiving system. they fingered white house special assistant laura crabtree callahan, who was overseeing the computer contractors despite obtaining computer-science degrees from diploma mills.read more: nyp",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.05263157894736842,10.098571428571429,14.171428571428573,0.0,0.0
"u.s. presidential race, north dakota, syria: your weekend briefing - the new york times","here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. north korea conducted a powerful nuclear test that showcased its increasing mastery of atomic weaponry and confronted the u. s. with new diplomatic and security challenges. military experts said the increasing expertise, paired with headway in developing intercontinental ballistic missiles, could bring the continental u. s. in reach of a nuclear warhead by 2020. analysts say that north korea cultivates a sense of unpredictability verging on irrationality, but that, in fact, the government remains coldly calculating, edging up to the brink of war to keep aggressors at bay and its savagely oppressed people cowed. above, a protest in south korea. _____ 2. president obama is back in washington after a trip to asia. he visited laos to recognize the scars of the u. s. secret war there during the vietnam conflict and, standing alongside the leader of china, formally committed the world’s two largest economies to the paris climate agreement. mr. obama has pushed hard on measures to fight climate change, logging historic achievements abroad but frustrating setbacks at home. watch our interview with mr. obama here. _____ 3. the race to succeed mr. obama has just about eight weeks to go, and it’s getting even more intense. hillary clinton and donald trump clashed over national security, as mr. trump proposed dropping spending caps on the military and mrs. clinton pledged to never send u. s. soldiers back into iraq or into syria. each candidate made statements that drew intense criticism: mr. trump’s backing for vladimir putin drew reminders of the russian leader’s harshly oppressive tactics and territorial aggression, and mrs. clinton’s characterization of half of mr. trump’s supporters as being “in a basket of deplorables” — “the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamaphobic, you name it” that he has empowered. _____ 4. the u. s. today commemorates the 15th anniversary of the sept. 11 attacks, the deadliest terrorist attack on u. s. soil. the national september 11 memorial museum, at ground zero, has portraits of almost all of the nearly 3, 000 people killed that day in new york, washington and pennsylvania, but seven are still being sought. can you help? there may be no better way to understand how the passengers of flight 93 fought their hijackers and brought their plane down in shanksville, pa. killing all aboard, than listening to robert franz, a interpretive park ranger at the memorial there. _____ 5. uber will introduce a fleet of about 100 cars in pittsburgh within days, each with a human monitor in the driver’s seat. this is not just a test of the technology. it’s also a demonstration of “greenlight governing,” i. e. giving tech companies help and lots of freedom. pittsburgh officials helped uber lease riverfront land for a testing track and warded off new state regulations. “you can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,” the mayor said. “if you want to be a laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet. ” _____ 6. college campuses around the nation are stepping up discussions of microaggressions and triggers as they address racism, diversity, sexual consent and excessive drinking in their fall orientation programs. but the schools can find themselves in a bind. racist episodes sharply depressed enrollment for at least one university, but alumni upset over the currents in college culture, including efforts to silence those whose opinions differ, are closing their wallets. _____ 7. the obama administration made an unusual intervention in a protest in north dakota, temporarily blocking construction of part of the dakota access oil pipeline minutes after a federal judge had cleared the project. thousands of native americans and activists have been protesting, warning that a section of the pipeline that is to go under a river has the potential to foul tribal water supplies and ancestral cultural sites. the justice department and other agencies called for discussions on giving greater consideration of tribes’ views for “these types of infrastructure projects. ” _____ 8. public health experts have raised more alarms on zika, but partisan fighting has kept congress from adding to funds to combat the virus. urgently needed measures in puerto rico and florida are at risk, and fears of zika spreading along the gulf coast are growing. peak mosquito season there will not end until november. and lawmakers are going to the wire again on funding the government. at this point, only stopgap measures will keep the lights on after sept. 30. president obama invited congressional leaders to the white house on monday to discuss that and other priorities. _____ 9. the u. s. and russia, after 10 months of failed talks, agreed to embark on a new approach to syria. the deal depends on russia restraining syria’s loyalist forces, and on the u. s. persuading opposition groups it supports to separate from the nusra front, an affiliate of al qaeda. above, a wounded syrian boy comforted another. the u. s. has now accepted 10, 000 syrian refugees. here’s where they’ve been placed. and here’s a look at what it’s like when young refugees from all over try to fit in at an ordinary american high school. _____ 10. clothes you can buy now, or at least order, are the big news from the opening of the fall fashion season. new york fashion week (followed by fashion weeks in london, milan and paris) also proved that the clothes are no longer enough — the shows have to provide an experience. our critic looked at two representative cases: kanye west’s performance piece and tom ford’s evening of dinner theater. it doesn’t matter that only a select few can physically attend, she writes: their instagram and facebook posts invite followers to try to get closer by getting “a product that was in the room. ” _____ 11. finally, researchers have found fascinating new aspects of the lives of the bonobo, the endangered primate that is one of our closest relatives. famed for their hypersexuality, bonobos also form strong bonds among females and weak ones among males, in sharp contrast to the closely related chimpanzee. in fact, senior females will lead coalitions of two or more juniors to drive off harassing males. “it’s a matriarchy,” a primatologist said. “females are running the show. ” have a great week. _____ your weekend briefing is published sundays at 6 a. m. eastern. and don’t miss your morning briefing, weekdays at 6 a. m. eastern, and your evening briefing, weeknights at 6 p. m. eastern. want to look back?

review: ‘rogue one’ leaves ‘star wars’ fans wanting more and less - the new york times,"the great mystery of “rogue one” — the big payoff, the thing people like me would be pilloried for divulging, the puzzle you will congratulate yourself for solving — is where it fits in with the rest of the “star wars” cycle. there are scattered hints early on, and later appearances by familiar characters that elicit chuckles of recognition from fans. the very last shot tells us exactly where we are, and why we should have cared about everything we just saw. whether that is enough — whether the fractures in the rebel alliance and the power struggles in the imperial ranks quicken our pulses and engage our emotions — is the big question, but it really isn’t a question at all. millions of people will sit through this thoroughly mediocre movie (directed with basic competence by gareth edwards from a surprisingly hackish script by chris weitz and tony gilroy) and convince themselves that it’s perfectly delightful. it’s so much easier to obey than to resist. the spoiler warning sent by the disney empire instructed journalists to “continue to be our partners on this journey,” and defiance is unthinkable, even if “partner” is taken as a synonym for “shill. ” but the injunction not to ruin anyone’s good time by “revealing spoilers and detailed story points” is itself revealing, an indication of the meager and disposable pleasures this movie is meant to provide, and also of the low regard its makers have for the audience. it hasn’t always been this way, of course. the first “star wars” trilogy had a fresh, insurgent energy, and learning the names of all those planets and galactic adventurers has seemed, to generations of fans, like a new and special kind of fun. now, though, it is starting to feel like drudgery, a schoolbook exercise in a course of study that has no useful application and that will never end. “rogue one,” named for the call sign of an imperial cargo ship appropriated by rebel fighters, is the opposite of that vessel. masquerading as a heroic tale of rebellion, its true spirit is empire all the way down. like the fighters on the planet scarif, which is surrounded by an atmospheric shield, you are trapped inside this world, subjected to its whims and laws. you can’t escape, because it is the supposed desire to escape that brought you here in the first place. maybe i’m exaggerating. the cast is wonderful. felicity jones is a fine addition to the “star wars” tradition of heroines. she plays jyn erso, the daughter of galen erso (mads mikkelsen) a scientist whose allegiances are a little ambiguous. not at all ambiguous is ben mendelsohn’s orson krennic, a marvel of sneering, vainglorious villainy in an impeccable white uniform, complete with a cape that billows behind him when he strides down a starship catwalk. jyn’s idealistic tendencies are at first checked by a hint of cynicism. she’s suspicious of the rebels and contemptuous of the empire, and has complicated feelings about saw gerrera (forest whitaker) the extremist militant who cared for her in her father’s absence. when a mission announces itself — i don’t think i’m supposed to say too much about it, other than that it’s highly perilous and requires a lot of and aerial battling — jyn gathers up an appealing, motley guerrilla crew. there’s a renegade imperial pilot (riz ahmed) a resistance type (diego luna) a blind monk (donnie yen) and a bearded berserker (wen jiang). and naturally, a wisecracking droid, speaking in the dry, sarcastic tones of the indispensable alan tudyk. all the pieces are there, in other words, like lego figures in a box. the problem is that the filmmakers haven’t really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them. a couple of on a rainy afternoon would come up with better adventures, and probably also better dialogue. plots and subplots are handled with clumsy expediency, and themes that might connect this movie with the larger lucasfilm mythos aren’t allowed to develop. you’re left wanting both more and less. there are too many characters, too much tactical and technical explanation, too much prattle. and at the same time, there isn’t quite enough of the filial dynamic between galen and jyn, and not enough weight given to the ethical and strategic problems of rebellion. when might ends justify means? what kind of sacrifice is required in the service of a righteous cause? popular art — “star wars” included — has often proved itself capable of exploring these kinds of questions with clarity, vigor and even a measure of nuance. but “rogue one” has no such ambitions, no will to persuade the audience of anything other than the continued strength of the brand. it doesn’t so much preach to the choir as propagandize to the captives, telling us that we’re free spirits and partners on the journey. the only force at work here is the force of habit.",0,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.633333333333333,6.0,0.0,0.0

physician aid in dying gains acceptance in the u.s. - the new york times,"judith katherine dunning had been waiting anxiously for california to adopt legislation that would make it legal for her to end her life. the cancer in her brain was progressing despite several rounds of treatment. at 68, she spent most of her day asleep and needed an aide to help with basic tasks. more centrally, ms. dunning — who, poignantly, had worked as an oral historian in berkeley, calif. — was losing her ability to speak. even before the end of life option act became law, in october 2015, she had recorded a video expressing her desire to hasten her death. the video, she hoped, would make her wishes clear, in case there were any doubts later on. “she felt she had completed all the important tasks of her life,” recalled her physician, dr. michael rabow, director of the symptom management service at the university of california, san francisco. “when she could no longer communicate, life was no longer worth living. ” in recent months, this option has become available to a growing number of americans. last june, legislation took effect in california, the most populous state. in november, colorado voters approved a ballot measure by nearly a majority. the district of columbia council has passed a similar law, and the mayor quietly signed it last month. aid in dying was already legal in washington, vermont, montana and oregon. so even if the district of columbia’s law is blocked, as a prominent republican representative has threatened to do, the country has arrived at a remarkable moment: close to 20 percent of americans live in jurisdictions where adults can legally end their lives if they are terminally ill and meet eligibility requirements. the laws, all based on the death with dignity act oregon adopted in 1997, allow physicians to write prescriptions for lethal drugs when patients qualify. the somewhat complicated procedure involves two oral requests and a written one, extensive discussions, and approval by two physicians. patients must have the mental capacity to make medical decisions. while that process took shape in oregon two decades ago, the cultural and political context surrounding it has changed considerably. the states recently considering the issue differ from earlier adopters, and as opposition from some longtime adversaries has softened, new obstacles have arisen. historically, aid in dying has generated fierce resistance from the catholic church, from certain activists, and from others who cite religious or moral objections. even the terminology — aid in dying? assisted suicide? death with dignity? — creates controversy. but the concept has long drawn broad support in public opinion polls. polltakers for the general social survey, done by norc at the university of chicago have asked a representative national sample this question since 1977: “when a person has a disease that cannot be cured, do you think doctors should be allowed by law to end the patient’s life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it?” the proportion of americans responding affirmatively, always a substantial majority, has bounced between 66 and 69 percent for 15 years. but support was not evenly distributed: such laws initially were enacted in states with predominantly white populations like oregon, and to date the vast majority of patients who have used them are white. “i hear people talk all the time about this being a rich white person’s issue,” said donna smith, legislative manager for the district of columbia at the group compassion and choices, who is . “now, we have proof on the ground that that is not true. ” indeed, aid in dying has expanded to more diverse locales. whites represent a minority of californians. colorado is more than 21 percent latino. in the district of columbia, nearly half of whose residents are five of six black council members voted in favor of the legislation. state medical societies, once active foes of initiatives, also have begun shifting their positions, citing deep divisions among their members. the california medical association, the colorado medical society and the medical society of the district of columbia all took officially neutral stances as legislators and voters debated, depriving opponents of influential allies. so has the state medical society in maryland, where legislators plan to reintroduce a bill (the third attempt) this month. the american medical association, an opponent since 1993, has asked its council on ethical and judicial affairs to look at the issue and submit a report in june, though without recommending any policy. but even as the idea gains acceptance, passage of a bill or ballot measure does not always make aid in dying broadly available to those who want it. in addition to the safeguards the law requires, its practice can be balky — at least in the early stages. state provisions allow any individual or institution to decline to provide prescriptions. in california, catholic health care systems have opted out, predictably, but so have a number of others, including vitas, the nation’s largest hospice chain. moreover, california hospitals and hospices can forbid their affiliated physicians to write the necessary prescriptions, even if they are acting privately. some health systems with hundreds of doctors have done so. (vermont, colorado and the district of columbia allow doctors to make individual decisions.) “the shortage of participating providers has led to a lot of patient and family frustration,” said dr. laura petrillo, palliative care physician at the san francisco v. a. medical center, in an email. “they had the expectation that it would be available and happen seamlessly once the law went into effect, and then find themselves needing to do a lot of legwork” to find doctors willing to prescribe lethal drugs and pharmacies to fill prescriptions, she said. sometimes, when patients have waited until late in their illnesses, they die before they can become eligible for assisted death. or they become too physically or mentally incapacitated to take the drugs themselves, as legally required, even if they do qualify. in areas where many providers opt out, very sick patients may have to travel long distances to use the law. and costs can also prove a barrier. some private insurers pay for the necessary doctors’ visits and drugs. in california, most do, said matt whitaker, state director of compassion and choices, the leading advocacy group. but congress has long prohibited the use of federal dollars for aid in dying, so medicare and the department of veterans affairs will not cover it. states like california and oregon have agreed to cover the costs for medicaid recipients others do not. cost mattered less years ago, when a lethal dose of barbiturates ran a couple of hundred dollars. but in 2015, as california legislators introduced their bill, valeant pharmaceuticals acquired seconal, the most commonly used drug. the company, known (and condemned) for a similar strategy with other medications, spiked the price, a move mr. whitaker called “ethically and morally bankrupt. ” now, patients whose insurers will not cover aid in dying face paying $3, 000 to $4, 000 for the drug. valeant has denied the suggestion that it was exploiting the new law. as a result, physicians are turning to alternative — and — combinations of opioids and sedatives for those who cannot afford the standard medication. despite such obstacles and disappointments, an emboldened compassion and choices, with a staff that has tripled since 2008 and an annual budget that has nearly quadrupled to $16. 9 million — is eyeing its next targets. over several years, its leaders think they can help legalize aid in dying in maryland, hawaii and new york. aid in dying, it should be noted, may be a vehemently debated issue, with campaigns that can involve thousands of participants and millions of dollars — but it ultimately has affected a tiny proportion of people. the number of residents taking advantage of these laws in oregon and washington has climbed in the past two years. still, after nearly 20 years in oregon and eight in washington, far fewer than 1 percent of annual deaths involve a lethal prescription. (of those residents who do receive one, about a third do not use it.) it’s not the way most americans choose to die, even when they have the legal option. yet the end of life care most people receive needs substantial improvement. while partisans fight over aid in dying, skeptics like dr. rabow note, the complicated and expensive measures that could improve care for the great majority — overhauled medical education, better staffed and operated nursing homes, increased access to hospice and palliative care — go largely unaddressed. still, ms. dunning was dr. rabow’s longtime patient. when california’s act took effect, she began the process of requesting lethal medication. her speech had slurred further, but not yet enough to render her unintelligible. dr. rabow did not want to see her die, and he is no fan of the movement. but ms. dunning had been clear, consistent and determined. he wrote the prescription. “she was ready to have her life end, and no amount of support or medication or counseling would change the situation,” he said. in september, she invited him to her home, where she planned to swallow the fatal slurry of barbiturates. on the appointed day, dr. rabow arrived to find “a house full of people who didn’t want her to end her life, but were there to support her and respect her decision. ” over the course of the day, people said their goodbyes, then withdrew to leave ms. dunning with her closest relatives, her hospice nurse and her doctor. her son mixed her seconal solution and she swallowed it, no simple task for someone with advanced cancer. she lost consciousness almost immediately and died several hours later. “i wished she could have had a natural life span,” dr. rabow said. “and i would have made a different choice. but i was honored to be there to watch this very dignified woman live her life the way she wanted to. ”",0,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,3.283461538461541,8.753846153846155,0.07142857142857142,0.0

'gates of hell': iraqi army says fighting near tal afar worse than mosul,"(story corrects third paragraph to show mosul fell in july, not june, after nine, not eight, months of urban warfare in august 29th instance.) by ahmed rasheed baghdad (reuters) - iraqi forces battling to retake the small town of al- ayadiya where militants fleeing tal afar have entrenched themselves, saying on tuesday the fighting is multiple times worse than the battle for mosul s old city. hundreds of battle-hardened fighters were positioned inside most houses and high buildings inside the town, making it difficult for government forces to make any progress, army officers told reuters. iraqi government troops captured the town of mosul from islamic state in july, but only after nine months of grinding urban warfare. but one iraqi officer, colonel kareem al-lami, described breaching the militants first line of defense in al- ayadiya as like opening the gates of hell . iraqi forces have in recent days recaptured almost all of the northwestern city of tal afar, long a stronghold of islamic state. they have been waiting to take al- ayadiya, just 11 km (7 miles) northwest of the city, before declaring complete victory. tough resistance from the militants in al- ayadiya has forced the iraqi forces to increase the number of air strikes, as well as bring in reinforcements from the federal police to boost units from the army, air force, federal police, the elite u.s.-trained counter-terrorism service (cts) and some units from the shi ite popular mobilization forces (pmf). up to 2,000 battle-hardened militants were believed to be defending tal afar against around 50,000 government troops last week. military intelligence indicated that many militants fled tal afar to mount a staunch defense in al- ayadiya. many motorcycles carrying the islamic state insignia were seen abandoned at the side of the road outside al- ayadiya. though the exact numbers of militants on the ground in al- ayadiya was still unclear, al-lami, the iraqi army colonel, estimated they were in their hundreds. daesh (islamic state) fighters in their hundreds are taking positions inside almost every single house in the town, he said. sniper shots, mortars, heavy machine guns and anti-armored projectiles were fired from every single house, he added. we thought the battle for mosul s old city was tough, but this one proved to be multiple times worst, al-lami said. we are facing tough fighters who have nothing to lose and are ready to die. two army officers told reuters that no significant advances had yet been made in al- ayadiya. they said they were waiting for artillery and air strikes to undermine the militants power. the extra federal police troops that were called in said late on tuesday that they had controlled 50 percent of the town, deploying snipers on the high buildings and intensified shelling the militants headquarters with rockets, a federal police spokesman said in a statement. tal afar became the next target of the u.s.-backed war on the jihadist group following the recapture of mosul, where it had declared its caliphate over parts of iraq and syria in 2014.",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.726153846153846,8.276923076923078,0.15384615384615385,0.0
letting go of old patterns of reaction,"leave a reply mary o’malley – a friend of mine was gifted a vacation on a river barge through france and germany. she was really excited because she could never afford to do this on her own. her itinerary included a flight from seattle to new york and the next day, she and her cousin would fly to europe together. as they were getting ready to go through the international security checkpoint, the tsa officer would not let my friend through because her passport had expired. at that moment, a feeling of panic came over her when she realized she had grabbed the wrong passport. as the panic began to intensify, she tuned into her body and used her breath to calm herself down and think rationally. having done awakening work for some time, she realized that reacting to whatever life is offering only creates suffering. she said, “mary, i can’t believe it. if this happened years ago, i would have had a temper tantrum and been in tears all day. instead, i calmly told my cousin to go on without me and i would have a friend in seattle overnight my passport so i could take a flight the following day.” this is the power of accepting whatever life brings. she added “i did not react or panic when i realized i would have to pay for a new ticket and stay in new york by myself. it all turned out so differently than what i thought, and it was all okay.” whenever we are faced with a challenge, whether it is a cut on our finger, a raging boss, or an expired passport, we all react in our own unique ways. one of the core ways we can heal ourselves is by getting to know our own patterns of reaction. some of the standard modes of reaction are the stoic, the pleaser, the worrier, the rager, the freezer, the rescuer, the victim, the judger and the self-absorbed one. we put these reactive parts of ourselves together into our own particular style. our patterns of reaction can bring so much heartache into our lives. my primary mode of reaction was to freeze, and like all patterns of reaction, it would tighten me, isolate me and cut me off from the flow of love that is life. it got stronger as i got older, and it became much more entrenched when i tried to make it stop. then i learned how to see it and meet it with understanding and mercy. only then was i able to free-up this frozen energy and learn how to respond to life rather than always living in reaction. this process of seeing, loving and letting go of your patterns of reaction happens in three phases. first phase: you are caught. you either can’t see your patterns or, if you do, you have little willingness to do anything about them. you also don’t recognize the consequences that come from living out of your repetitive reactions. when you decide you don’t want to live this way anymore, you usually declare war on the pattern, trying to wrestle it to the ground. this only works for a short period of time because you haven’t done the work needed to dissolve the pattern. when the pattern comes back again, you then get caught in self-judgment (i did it again) and despair (i will never get out of this). you begin to move into the second phase when you see that the price you pay for taking care of yourself in your old ways isn’t worth it, and you understand that trying to wrestle it to the ground doesn’t work. second phase: as you come to realize that living out of your old patterns isn’t how you want to live, and trying to get rid of them seems to only empower them, you begin to become curious about what is going on and feel the possibility of living another way. at the beginning of this phase, when your patterns of reaction are triggered, you will get lost in them most of the time. but slowly, you become more curious and more merciful with yourself. even when you get completely lost, there comes a time when you can let go of judgment and despair, and simply notice how you are reacting. this may be right in the middle of the pattern, a few minutes afterwards, or a few days afterwards. you become more curious than controlling and more compassionate than judgmental. you finally come to the place where you can actually stand with the discomfort of not following your pattern. this almost feels like detox, and it is good to have the support of other people as you learn how to be with your experience rather than running away from it. the more you can be with yourself, the more it opens your heart. and that is really what you have been longing for all along – the ability to live from your own heart. third phase: as your ability to see and let go of your old patterns increases, you enter the third phase. this is where your primary relationship with yourself is one of compassion and curiosity. you still may get caught in your patterns, but only for short periods of time, and rather than bringing up judgment or despair, they become an invitation to open back into life. the more you can meet yourself exactly as you are, the more you discover how to live from your own truth. you can now let go of the idea that a good life is one where everything is under control. instead, you learn how to ride the ups and downs of your life, trusting yourself, trusting your life. you then become the awakened heart that heals not only yourself but also the world. there isn’t a clear delineation with these three phases. on any particular day, you may touch into all three phases. but the more you can be curious and merciful with yourself, the more you will naturally gravitate toward the third phase – the place of truly becoming yourself. this is the greatest gift you can give to yourself and to life. sf source mary o’malley",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,5.682857142857145,8.514285714285714,0.0,0.0
kris kobach: democrats already attacking election integrity commission,"kris kobach of the presidential advisory commission on election integrity, who is also secretary of state for kansas, joined siriusxm host alex marlow on monday’s breitbart news daily to discuss voter fraud and border security. [“the commission is going to be about a dozen people, bipartisan, five of them current or former secretaries of state,” kobach said. “what it’s going to do is take a nationwide look at the problem of voter fraud. there’s a lot of debate around the subject of voter fraud, and as someone who has been secretary of state in a state where we introduced photo id as well as proof of citizenship, and security for ballots — which is oftentimes a source of fraud or a type of fraud that occurs — we’re going to look at it from a nationwide perspective. ” “i’ve amassed a lot of data at the state level in kansas, but there really hasn’t ever been an effort by a federal entity to measure the statistics and the facts nationwide and see what the numbers look like,” he noted. kobach recalled that kansas and other states asked the obama administration to provide lists of aliens on legal visas to check against voter rolls, so they could weed out ineligible voters. “the federal government has consistently said no, under the obama administration. well, this commission will have the authority to maybe look at a couple of states and say, ‘okay, let’s check how many people who are registered voters in those states are also known aliens, according to the federal government,” he said. “that’s going to be exciting, something never done before, and it will give us some sense of what the real numbers are of this problem. ” “the social security administration has what’s called the ‘master death file.’ it sounds like some sort of starship from star wars, but the master death file is a list of people who have died. the social security administration wants to track that, and of course keep social security numbers rotating to people who are living. that’s a database that can be used to bump against some of the voter rolls,” he added. “things like that, where we can just take some hard statistics and gather some numbers — and we’ll also be looking at anecdotal things and prosecutions for voter fraud. it’s a big job,” kobach said. marlow anticipated that kobach would encounter obstructionism from democrats despite the bipartisan nature of his commission, because as he starkly put it, “we know that the democrats would like to have lax voter laws and voter rules, because that allows them to cheat. ” kobach said that after the commission was announced last week, “we did have people like chuck schumer coming out immediately and criticize me, and say that the commission is a waste of time. ” “my response is, ‘senator, what are you afraid of? what are you afraid the commission is going to find, that you would attack the of the commission ad hominem, and that you don’t want the commission to look at the evidence? ’” he said. “look, if he’s right and voter fraud is virtually in america, then the commission will find virtually nothing, and we will make his case for him,” kobach argued. “i think it’s kind of curious how some of the leadership of the democrat party — and that includes tom perez — have criticized the commission, when i would think if they really are interested in the facts, they would say ‘hey, great the commission will prove to us that voter fraud doesn’t exist.’ so yeah, it’s been interesting. ” kobach said the trump administration is “doing well” on immigration and border security so far, in his estimation. “i think the executive orders are what needed to be done. the vetting of people coming from parts of the world where terrorism is rampant, where isis or control territory, is very problematic. i give them high marks for that,” he said. “the other thing is, they’ve sent a very clear message to the ice agents that hey, we’re taking the rope off your hands, we’re untying your hands and letting you do your job,” he continued. “just by doing that, just by seeing ice agents more active and out on the field, back doing what they were supposed to do, that has sent a message to the smugglers and to the illegal aliens coming in that there is a new sheriff in town. ” “that’s why you’re seeing the border crossing numbers plummeting,” kobach stated. “i think that’s great. it does show what those of us who have studied and worked in the immigration field know, and that is that if you make a slight change of policy in washington, you’ll get an immediate reaction on the border. ” “for example, whenever the crowd starts talking about an amnesty — and under president obama, they had a president who was welcoming an amnesty — then immediately border crossings surged,” he recalled. “the word gets down south of the border very quickly, and people surge in, because they want to be in the country so that they can claim they were eligible for the amnesty when it happens. similarly, the opposite is true too. if a more aggressive enforcement begins, word gets across that hey, this is going to be tougher. the price of a coyote smuggling you in is going to double or triple. that affects behavior. ” “those are some good marks for the administration. i think there is more they could be doing, and hopefully they will be doing it in the near future,” he said. marlow cited some of the more vicious attacks on kobach’s character, and asked what it was like to endure such calumny merely because he insists on border security and clean elections. “it’s not good at all,” kobach replied. “they’ve been dragging my name through the mud for years now. i’ve become calloused to it, and it doesn’t bother me that much. but you know, it bothers my wife, my family. you don’t want your kids to read that. ” “it’s so false,” he continued. “when someone is in a debate, and they don’t have any arguments left, oftentimes on the left they resort to ad hominem remarks. they just attack you as a person. they call you a racist, they call you a vote suppressor. they just come up with these stupid names. that’s because they don’t have any actual arguments left. i’m not surprised any more by it. it doesn’t bother me, but it’s rather tedious, and i certainly don’t like my family seeing it. ” kobach anticipated his commission completing its work within a year, and said he would continue to work on ballot integrity and border security in the meantime. “we should see some interesting data, whatever it is, that the commission is able to present to the country. i continue to work in the area of illegal immigration as a litigator, so i’ll be working there. i think you’re going to see a lot of things happening, especially on sanctuary cities,” he said. “california has got this bill that has passed one house, it’s in the other house, to create a sanctuary state, which is just extraordinary. i think you could potentially see litigation on that. you could see litigation on a whole bunch of things,” he anticipated. “i’ll keep fighting to keep our voter rolls clean, and to help this commission find whatever there is to find on the subject nationally. the fight to secure our borders is something that has to be done both within the administration and without. states need to help. states like texas made a great effort to enlist state and local law enforcement, just like arizona did a few years ago. i’ll be continuing to push for that,” kobach promised. breitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. eastern.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,18.505,28.200000000000003,0.0,0.0
police are now warning people to take a photo of your hotel room right when you walk through the door,"november 2015 ads police are now warning people to take a photo of your hotel room right when you walk through the door oct 29, 2016 previous post in the united states alone there are more than one million people enslaved today. many of them were brought into the country by smugglers who specialize not in drugs, but in human trafficking. according to the u.s. state department, every year between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked across the country’s borders, half of them are children and 8 out of 10 are female. they are a fraction of the estimated 21 million people who have been trafficked around the world according the unicef, and demand for slavery and cheap labor has been steadily increasing. the numbers are shocking and eye-opening, they reflect the fact that human trafficking has now become the world’s fasted growing crime. in terms of scope and industry size it ranks third internationally, behind only illegal drugs and arms trafficking. the demand for cheap labor and sexual exploitation are the primary driving forces behind human trafficking. victims are modern day slaves who are being held against their will, abused, abducted, coerced, or threatened into compliance. they face unimaginable horrors and treatment at the hands of their abusers and yet most people can’t even image that this sort of crime is occurring every single day all across america, even in their own neighborhood. part of what makes human trafficking so hard to detect and investigate is that victims are constantly being moved around. traffickers rarely stay in one spot, instead they change locations frequently to evade law enforcement and make it super hard for authorities to track them down. that’s also why they use hotel rooms. not only do hotels afford criminals easy and convenient places to hide, they are perfect because rooms can be paid for in cash. statistics show that the majority of all trafficking crimes take place in hotel rooms. when traffickers bring their victims to a new hotel room they usually take a picture of them and upload it online as a type of advertisement. that’s where the traffickcam app comes into play. traffickcam takes user submitted photos of their hotel rooms and compiles them into an efficient, comparative search database. when traffickers post their photos online, authorities can search them against the database and therefore use it to try and find a match. everything in the photos that app users submit, from the wallpaper patterns, carpeting, artwork, and the view outside the windows can be used to match and find where traffickers pictures were taken. here’s how it works: download the free app to your smartphone and the next time you stay at a hotel snap 4 quick pictures of your room. when you submit them include the name of the hotel you’re staying at and the room number. you can do this when you’re leaving and these images are then added to the database. one day in the future, your picture could help to identify and locate victims and",1,20,0.0,0,0,0,0.1,6.960000000000001,8.0,0.0,0.0
"hollywood hypocrite leonard dicaprio jets la friends across the world 6,000 miles to hear his speech on global warming","sacrifice is for the peasants when hollywood actor leonardo dicaprio hosts a reception for a string of a-list stars, supermodels and wealthy philanthropists later this month, he will make an impassioned plea for more action to be taken on global warming.but instead of holding the event in los angeles, where most of his guests are based, they will fly halfway around the world to the glitzy french resort of st tropez at enormous cost to the environment.last night, green campaigners were quick to criticise 41-year-old dicaprio, who in february used his best actor acceptance speech at the oscars to warn about the dangers posed by climate change.the reception the grand-sounding leonardo dicaprio foundation annual gala to fund climate and biodiversity projects will be held on july 20 at the bertaud belieu vineyards on the french riviera.celebrities including kate hudson, charlize theron, cate blanchett, marion cotillard, penelope cruz, robert de niro, scarlett johansson, arnold schwarzenegger and kevin spacey are all expected to attend, along with a host of international rock and pop stars, supermodels and tycoons.and while a table seating 12 people at the gala costs up to 125,000, the real price will be paid by the environment.if just one guest among the 500 invitees chooses to fly the 12,000-mile round trip from la to st tropez by private jet a notoriously environmentally unfriendly way to travel they will produce 86 tons of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas.even those who use a scheduled flight will be responsible for releasing seven tons of co2 leading green campaigners to ask why the event could not have been held in hollywood or in st tropez during may s cannes film festival, when many of the guests would have been there anyway.robert rapier, an environmental analyst, said: dicaprio demonstrates why our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow. it s because everyone loves the combination of cost and convenience they offer. he believes that no sacrifice is necessary; just government policies that can provide him with a solar-powered yacht or jet, or that give individuals low-cost renewable energy on a broad scale. one guest who attended last year s gala said: it s basically a big party for leo and his showbusiness friends and models. the models, of course, do not pay for tickets, and neither do the vip guests they get to have a nice big free party. via: daily mail",1,19,0.0,0,0,0,0.05263157894736842,10.451578947368422,13.915789473684212,0.0,0.0

united states and cuba complete deals as trump era set to begin,"havana (reuters) - the obama administration and cuba continue to sign cooperation agreements this week, scrambling to complete negotiations on a range of issues with just days to go until donald trump is sworn in as u.s. president, potentially bringing a chill to relations. an agreement to cooperate on air and maritime search and rescue in the florida straits was signed on wednesday in havana, and another setting territorial limits in contested gulf of mexico waters was scheduled for signing on wednesday or thursday, according to diplomatic sources. a third agreement on health protocols for dealing with issues such as bird flu was scheduled for signing on wednesday, but postponed for later this week. it would be the last of 22 accords that have been concluded in the last 18 months. seeking to reverse more than 50 years of u.s. efforts to force communist-run cuba to change by isolating it, democratic president barack obama agreed with cuban president raul castro in december 2014 to work to normalize relations. since then the two countries have restored diplomatic relations and obama has taken a number of steps to increase travel and trade with cuba. trump, a republican who will be sworn in on friday, has threatened to end the detente if cuba does not make further political and other concessions, although he has not specified what these should be. the prospect of a fresh chill has prompted both governments to wrap up negotiations on five agreements since the november election, including one on fighting international crime and another on preventing and containing oil spills. the obama administration last week ended a 21-year-old special arrangement by which all cubans arriving in the united states, including without visas, were entitled to stay and seek residency. the policy had long been criticized by the cuban government. john kavulich, president of the u.s.-cuba trade and economic council which has followed business ties between the two countries for two decades, noted that while there had been a large array of recent agreements and memorandums of understanding, not all were binding treaties. “the commercial, economic and political bilateral relationship between the united states and cuba remains tentative, fragile, and immensely subject to the impact of winds from the north and winds from the south,” kavulich said. the trump transition team has included five cuban-americans who are vocal opponents of detente and who have close ties to cuban-american lawmakers calling for a return to efforts to isolate cuba. a number of trump appointees, including his national security advisor, michael flynn, have expressed opposition to the effort to normalize relations. obama has used executive orders, which can be scrapped by trump, to circumvent the longstanding u.s. trade embargo on cuba and ease some restrictions on travel and business. the embargo can be lifted only by the u.s. congress, which is controlled by republicans.

fukushima – the untouchable eco-apocalypse no one is talking about,"waking times – by alex pietrowski the most important ecological crisis of the world has ever seen has been underway since march 11th, 2011, yet there is nary a mention of it in the corporate media, and no political body in the world is championing its resolution. widespread denial and willful ignorance the effects on nature are already being seen, yet even among the environmentalist factions of media, there is strong denial of the damage already done and of what is to come as the crisis approaches its sixth year. some 300 tons of radioactive water are dumped into the pacific ocean each day , and signs are showing that this catastrophe is gravely affecting sea-life and wildlife in and around the pacific . the fda maintains that there is no evidence of contamination by fukushima borne radionuclides in the american food supply, yet this opinion is contested by some independent researchers. a report by the fairewinds energy education says that cancer is on the rise in areas around the failed power plant, and that millions will die in coming years as a result. “[t]he second report received from japan proves that the incidence of thyroid cancer is approximately 230 times higher than normal in fukushima prefecture… so what’s the bottom line? the cancers already occurring in japan are just the tip of the iceberg. i’m sorry to say that the worst is yet to come.” [ source ] as election year in the u.s. approaches its dramatic climax, it has been striking to observe that neither of the major two-party candidates, or third-party candidates for that matter, have mentioned this crisis at all during the entire election run up. it is a non-issue in american politics, and if you’re listening, the silence is deafening. the 40-year-plan thus far, all plans to stop radioactive contamination of the pacific ocean and the japanese islands have failed, the most impressive of which is the construction of a $320 million underground wall of frozen dirt to block the seepage of groundwater into surrounding areas. 1oo feet deep and over a mile long, the ‘ land-side impermeable wall ‘ is already failing as rainfall from recent typhoons has caused partial melting of sections of the ‘ice wall.’ workers examine pipes for the wall of frozen soil at the embattled fukushima no. 1 nuclear power plant. image credit: http://www.asahi.com/ a previous and ongoing cleanup effort requires the on site storage of contaminated water near the fukushima daiichi is merely a band-aid as radioactive water continues to accumulate by the day , with no long term plan for proper disposal. “…the filtered water is still full of tritium , a radioactive version of hydrogen. (when two neutrons are added to the element, it becomes unstable, prone to emitting electrons.) tritium bonds with oxygen just like normal hydrogen does, to produce radioactive “tritiated water.” it’s impractical—or at least extremely difficult and expensive—to separate tritiated water from normal water.” [ source ] storage tanks at the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear plant. the reality here is that this crisis is untouchable in its scope and unparalleled in its lethality, and tepco’s 40-year-plan to decommission the plant will be a failure. final thoughts no one of significant import is talking about this crisis or working to elevate it as a national and international priority. the american political scene is focused instead on the selection of the next president being chosen between two candidates who clearly have zero interest in addressing this dire issue. is this because nothing can be done about it? is this because the energy industry is controlling the conversation and covering up the truth ? or is this because the agenda for the u.s. at present is geared to destabilization and a push for expansion of the orwellian permanent war , and ecological disasters are supportive of the global depopulation scheme in play? in any case, the fukushima meltdown is a slow-burning apocalyptic event that desperately needs our attention. for more background, please view the following video summary: read more articles from alex pietrowski . about the author alex pietrowski is an artist and writer concerned with preserving good health and the basic freedom to enjoy a healthy lifestyle. he is a staff writer for wakingtimes.com and offgrid outpost , a provider of storable food and emergency kits . alex is an avid student of yoga and life. this article ( fukushima – the untouchable eco-apocalypse no one is talking about ) was originally created and published by waking times and is published here under a creative commons license with attribution to alexpietrowski and wakingtimes.com . it may be re-posted freely with proper attribution, author bio, and this copyright statement.",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.831111111111113,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0

"racist prick spits on black pair, yells n****** b*tch while starbucks customers silently watch","are we a post-racial nation? no, we re not, no matter what conservatives like to say, and what happened at a seattle starbucks is just further proof of that. dr. bob hughes, an associate dean at seattle university, was sitting with a colleague, just catching up, when an openly racist jerk decided it would be fun to be a completely racist jerk as he walked on past.hughes felt something on his hand, and then the guy called his friend a n***** b*tch before walking out. that s right, f**king n***** b*tch, he called one more time as he walked out the door. the other customers in the starbucks just kind of sat there, doing their own things in a deafening silence that demonstrates how post-racial we re not.these are two college administrators who were dressed professionally, and just talking inside a starbucks. kuow.org published an essay from dr. hughes, in which he said: as my colleague noted, as we waited to file a police report, we both know that we can t dress ourselves out of the perception of who were are in the dominant society. she and i were dressed in the kind of professional attire anyone would expect a college administrator to be wearing in the middle of a work day, are still targets for hate.but the young man didn t see educated college administrators sitting at the table. he saw two black people and, in his twisted sense of the rules of life, our socio-economic status, educational accomplishments or our age required no respect or deference. in fact, he seemed only to see a woman of color whom he could brazenly assault in an open space with others watching. he went on to explain that it took him back to his childhood in the 1950s and 60s, where he was a black kid growing up in an all-white community, and where this kind of racist, hateful behavior was normal because of that. silence from onlookers was normal then, and it appears it s still normal today.one woman offered to be a witness, and the manager of the starbucks helped them file a police report. in a truly post-racial world, as hughes said, nobody would stand for this. nobody would have just sat there quietly. and yet, we hear all the time from conservatives that black people, and everyone else who talks about racism, are the ones who are the problem because race doesn t matter anymore.this wouldn t have happened if race didn t matter anymore.the lack of immediate consequences for the young man who did this mean he will do it more and more, without shame and without remorse. hughes says: my guess is that next time, this young man will be more violent. unstopped, antisocial behavior like this escalates. and he lives in a world right now where he felt safe taking these actions. he ll feel even safer doing so if we end up with a president trump. what hughes and his colleague endured is disgusting in 2016.featured image via seattle university",1,14,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.727142857142859,11.314285714285715,0.0,0.0

"tested by russia, nato struggles to stay credible - the new york times","brussels — six weeks before a critical summit meeting aimed at bolstering nato’s deterrence against a resurgent russia, the alliance is facing a long list of challenges. the first is to find a country to lead the last of four military units to be deployed in poland and the three baltic nations. but that, analysts say, could be the least of its problems. security concerns are as high now as they have been since the end of the cold war. as the immigration crisis has strained relations within the continent, anxieties have been heightened by russian military offensives in crimea and eastern ukraine, and a bombing campaign in syria that has demonstrated moscow’s rapidly increasing capabilities. lately, russia has talked openly about the utility of tactical nuclear weapons. despite the growing threats, many european countries still resist strong measures to strengthen nato. many remain reluctant to increase military spending, despite past pledges. some, like italy, are cutting back. france is reverting to its traditional skepticism toward the alliance, which it sees as an instrument of american policy and an infringement on its sovereignty. and that is not to mention the declarations of the presumptive republican presidential nominee, donald j. trump, that nato is “obsolete,” that the allies are “ripping off” the united states and that he would not really be concerned if the alliance broke up. while that may be campaign bluster, it does reflect a growing unwillingness in the united states to shoulder a disproportionate share of the nato burden, militarily and financially. the current concern, and a major element of what the nato secretary general, jens stoltenberg, calls “the biggest reinforcement of collective defense since the end of the cold war,” is the decision to put four combat battalions of up to 1, 000 soldiers each in those countries bordering russia. while britain, germany and the united states have agreed to lead one battalion each, to be filled out with soldiers from other nato allies to preserve the idea of multinational forces, leadership of the fourth is not yet in sight as the july summit meeting in warsaw rapidly approaches. the united states “is not thinking about doing two,” said its ambassador to nato, douglas e. lute. “we’re planning to do one and get our allies to step up” for the other three. but other larger nations like italy and france have declined. italy cut military spending after pledging to increase it two years ago in wales. its leaders say it is already participating in a newly enlarged alliance force. and france, which has reverted under the current socialist government to a more mistrusting view of nato and its american leadership, is stretched thin in its military campaigns in mali, the central african republic and north africa and syria, let alone patrolling its own streets against terrorist attack. france is likely to contribute only about 150 soldiers to the new deployments, nato officials say, after finally agreeing to the idea of forward deployments in poland after initial opposition. germany, which six months ago opposed these deployments, agreed in return for efforts at renewed dialogue with russia. it also agreed to lead one battalion. so the search goes on for a fourth lead nation. mr. stoltenberg is confident it will be found by the summit meeting. the deployments are important, because these combat battalions are designed not to be simple tripwires, but to be large enough and sufficiently well equipped to do an invader real damage. then they can be reinforced more quickly with the enhanced force and — another nato and american decision — to station another united states armored combat brigade of around 5, 000 soldiers in europe (for a total of three) and to its heavy equipment like tanks and artillery. poland is demanding that some of that equipment be on its territory, but for the moment, most of it will go to germany, belgium and the netherlands, which have storage and transport facilities dating from the cold war. only now, in fact, is nato actually surveying the infrastructure — the bridges, roads and railways — of relatively newer member states in central and eastern europe, not having judged it necessary before to plan how to quickly reinforce them in case of a russian invasion. in eastern europe would currently require large sums for capital investment to build special new warehouses and infrastructure, mr. lute said. poland, eager to send messages to moscow, did succeed in advancing groundbreaking for a ballistic missile defense site to coincide with the operational opening of one in romania. while mr. stoltenberg and washington insist that such missile defenses are not aimed at russian intercontinental ballistic missiles, moscow is not convinced. here, too, france has been skeptical, nervous that the reaction time of missile defense will circumvent the political oversight of the north atlantic council, the assembly of member states and their ambassadors that makes nato decisions by consensus. for the same reason, france has been reluctant to allow the nato supreme commander, who is always an american general, too much authority to act in a crisis, which others say is needed to respond quickly. but the initial missile defense program, combined with new forward deployments near russia (to be rotated, to avoid calling them “permanent”) and an enlarged rapid reaction force, supposedly ready to deploy in 48 hours, all are a measure of how much russia’s recent actions have changed nato’s calculations. nato is trying to reassure vulnerable members like the baltic states, poland and even southern members, like romania, bulgaria and turkey on the black sea, that the alliance intends to deliver on its promise of collective defense. missile defense is part of the response, along with more naval exercises in the black sea and more consistent overflights by reconnaissance aircraft. as mr. stoltenberg points out, the impact of russian policy has finally pushed european members of nato to at least halt the decline in military spending. this year, he said, estimates are that european allies will as a whole increase military spending, something washington has been demanding, even though most are not yet spending the 2 percent of g. d. p. that is the nato guideline. some 16 of the 28 member states have increased military spending in real terms, with only italy, bulgaria and croatia still cutting, although they insist that the cuts are temporary. “i know the mood in washington and i understand it: the americans want to see the europeans doing more, contributing more,” mr. stoltenberg said. “this has been my main message in european capitals. ” still, there is another troubling issue for nato — how to deal with a new russian military doctrine that considers the utility of tactical nuclear weapons at the beginning of a conflict, as a deterrent against an adversary retaking territory, followed by what planners call “a quick . ” some member nations believe that russia already has nuclear weapons in the enclave of kaliningrad, on the baltic sea, where it publicly displayed nuclear warheads in a previous exercise. russia has been unclear about whether they have been removed. while aware of public horror about using nuclear weapons, mr. stoltenberg, mr. lute and others emphasize that nato “remains a nuclear alliance” and that its deterrence is meant to be “seamless,” ranging from responses to cyberattacks through conventional weapons and if necessary, nuclear weapons, too. nato does not regard its nuclear arsenal as having any use other than political deterrence, mr. stoltenberg said. “but as long as nuclear weapons exist in the world,” he said, “we have to remain a nuclear alliance. ”",0,13,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.790000000000003,8.133333333333335,0.0,0.0

north korea's kim congratulates china's xi after congress,"seoul (reuters) - north korean leader kim jong un sent a rare congratulatory message to chinese president xi jinping on wednesday at the end of china s communist party congress, wishing him great success as head of the nation, the north s state media said. the friendly gesture by the north korean leader, who seldom issues personal messages, comes as china is being urged by the international community to do more to rein in the north s missile and nuclear tests that have raised tensions globally. xi became china s most powerful leader since mao zedong at the all-important week-long congress. it expressed the conviction that the relations between the two parties and the two countries would develop in the interests of the peoples of the two countries, the north s state-run central news agency said in a statement on thursday, citing the message sent by kim to xi. the chinese people have entered the road of building socialism with the chinese characteristics in the new era under the guidance of xi, the message said. the two countries often exchange routine diplomatic correspondence and ceremonial letters to each other on political anniversaries or political promotions, although personal messages to and from the leaders tend to be few. analysts said it was too early to tell whether or not ties between the two countries were warming up. congratulatory messages between north korea and china are an old story and reading too much into the message exchanged would be a one-sided analysis, said yang moo-jin, professor at the university of north korean studies in seoul. it s what they usually do and not surprising at all. china is the north s sole major ally, and accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. beijing has been called upon by several countries, especially the united states, to step up its efforts to curb north korea s ambitions towards building a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile that can reach the united states. it has shown it is irritated with pyongyang following the isolated state s numerous missile launches and nuclear tests, repeatedly calling for restraint and urging all sides to speak and act carefully. chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said at a regular briefing on thursday that china had received congratulatory messages from many countries and parties, including one from north korea. china and north korea are close neighbors and have a tradition of friendly contact, he said, without elaborating. china has said it will strictly enforce u.n. security council sanctions banning imports of north korean coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the north. north korea has not engaged in any missile or nuclear provocations since mid-september, although it tends to test fewer missiles late in the year for unexplained reasons. north korea has been walking a diplomatic tightrope by taking advantage of strategic mistrust between china and russia, but it has not been easy as beijing has sternly responded to its nuclear and missile provocations, said kim han-kwon, a professor at the korea national diplomatic academy in seoul. china s party congress is over, but kim jong un s concerns will only continue to deepen. the most significant event at hand is the upcoming summit between xi and (u.s. president donald) trump, said kim.",0,8,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.130000000000003,13.200000000000001,0.0,0.0
florida judge blames rape victim for attending music festival,"the ultra music festival in miami is one of the largest electronic dance music festivals in the world. over 170,000 people attended this year, and with it came several arrests, but one of the most horrific was the rape of a tourist from brazil, which was blamed by a florida judge due to the festival.transit worker for the department of transportation and public works in miami, carl lee wilt, allegedly took the 22-year-old girl into a utility closet after she was prevented from boarding a public transit train for being too intoxicated, according to the police report.a witness harassed police officers in the area for 15 minutes until they decided to knock on the utility door, which wilt opened five minutes later with his pants undone. police said wilt admitted to sexually assaulting the girl, but apparently stopped when she defecated herself.the girl told officers she had no recollection of how she met wilt or what happened during their encounter.miami-dade judge nushin sayfie ordered wilt be held without bond, who faces kidnapping and sexual battery charges, but then proceeded to blame the victim and the ultra music festival for the rape. this is why we shouldn t let our kids go to ultra right here, sayfie said, who was appointed by former republican florida governor charlie crist in 2007. her argument is straight out of the 1984 kevin bacon film, footloose, in which a small town has banned dancing and rock music. unlike policing victims behavior, educating people about rape can make lasting progress toward prevention. one study showed that after just one hour of education on sexual assault, men were less likely to believe myths about rape or consider being sexually coercive, wrote suzannah weiss in a 2015 article for bustle. once we recognize that sexual assault can happen to anyone, we can stop wondering what the victim did to deserve it and start wondering what allowed the perpetrator to go through with it. that s the only way we can gain the control we crave and create the just world we want to believe in. it is deeply disturbing this type of blame-the-victim language is coming from a judge in one of the biggest cities in the country. carl lee wilt would have raped someone given the opportunity to, no matter whether there was a dance festival going on or not. judge sayfie should reevaluate her own judgment on these issues before presiding over another similar case. featured image via flickr",1,9,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.208888888888893,16.933333333333334,0.0,0.0
swiss stop seizing income from asylum seekers to pay for upkeep,"zurich (reuters) - switzerland will stop seizing income from some would-be asylum seekers to help pay for their upkeep, the government said on wednesday, scrapping a rule that has drawn scrutiny by human rights groups. the government now imposes a special fee confiscating 10 percent of income earned for up to a decade by foreigners provisionally admitted to the country. this ends as of the start of next year. the change applies to foreigners who have been ordered to leave but cannot be sent back to their native countries because this would violate international law or put them in danger. many end up staying for years. the cabinet called the change a way to promote employing foreigners already here at a time the country is trying to rein in immigration. a quarter of the swiss population is foreign. eliminating this fee reduces the administrative burden on employers. on the other hand it makes it easier for people who have been provisionally admitted to start work, it said. stefan frey, spokesman for the swiss refugee council human rights group, said the move was a gratifying first step by the government. we welcome this as an individual measure but the work is far from done in the area of provisional admissions, he said. switzerland will still require arriving asylum seekers to turn over to the state assets they have worth more than 1,000 swiss francs ($1,014) to help offset costs they trigger, the state secretariat for migration said in response to an enquiry. broadcaster srf in 2016 revealed the swiss practice, which in similar form had drawn sharp rebukes for denmark.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.936363636363637,8.036363636363637,0.09090909090909091,0.0

an unlikely contender rises in france as the antithesis of trump - the new york times,"paris — in the age of donald j. trump, “brexit” and the resurgent french far right, a thin, aging career politician with an ironic smile is being called — by him and his supporters — france’s best defense against raging global populism. a first test for alain juppé, 71, comes sunday as france’s mainstream republican party holds a primary ahead of next spring’s presidential election. mr. juppé is favored to come out on top, for now. his ascendance is all the more improbable because, in a previous post, he was considered one of france’s most unpopular prime ministers ever. and he was once convicted in a paris city hall corruption scheme. but the election of mr. trump has upended french politics and given new momentum to the leader marine le pen. as a result, mainstream conservatives are far from delighted. the candidacy of the mr. juppé is seen by his supporters as a bulwark at a time when the postelection united states is now routinely depicted as one leg of a global tripartite menace, along with china and russia, bearing down on fragile western democracies. mr. juppé doesn’t shout, wave his arms or make grandiose promises — seen as a plus by his supporters. his professorial bearing stands in contrast to his sometimes bombastic and offending party rival, nicolas sarkozy, the former president who has redefined himself as a tough guy for uncertain times. but while other contenders for the presidency are adopting mr. trump’s depiction of muslims as an inherent threat, mr. juppé’s soothing message of french unity has, so far, helped him to lead opinion polls. still, mr. juppé’s tenure as prime minister during the 1990s was one of the most divisive in modern french history, marked by proposed cutbacks to generous pensions that brought thousands into the streets in protest. mr. juppé’s plan ultimately failed. this time around, he has promised more reforms and has vowed not to back down in the face of inevitable protests. in that regard, the technocratic mr. juppé, of all the contenders, may present the biggest challenge to france’s social protections and labor rules. the governing socialists, saddled with a poor economic record and an unpopular incumbent president, françois hollande, are already being written off. the race is considered the right’s to lose. just behind mr. sarkozy in the polls, nipping at his heels, is another former prime minister, françois fillon. the winner of sunday’s republican primary — there will be a runoff on nov. 27 — is considered likely to face ms. le pen in april’s presidential election. if previous patterns hold, ms. le pen will be defeated, which would make mr. juppé the likeliest of all those now running to become the next french president. the announcement on wednesday by emmanuel macron, a popular former economy minister in the socialist government, that he, too, will enter the presidential race is unlikely to change the right and dynamic, in the eyes of many observers. at 38, mr. macron has the image of a youthful reformer, but analysts have noted his thin record, lack of a party base, and absence of heft — he has never held elected office — in a universe of surging populism. mr. juppé, on the other hand, has won and lost numerous elections and has served for many years as the mayor of bordeaux, where he has been credited with transforming the city. but, with high unemployment, an injection of energy from mr. trump’s victory into ms. le pen’s campaign — xenophobic nationalism is her core theme — and the same social and economic fractures as in the united states, there are no guarantees. the warning signs from across the atlantic were evident in a campaign swing through lower burgundy on wednesday, as mr. juppé met with disgruntled farmers and rural officials. the french news media has noted that the american election results have colored the former prime minister’s message with concern about the existence of two frances: one benefiting from globalization, and the other left behind. there are the large, vibrant cities — paris, lyon, mr. juppé’s bordeaux — and then there are the shuttered main streets of sleepy provincial capitals and rural towns like those he visited on wednesday. wearing the coat and tie he appears never to shed, mr. juppé got his shoes muddy at a grain and dairy farm whose owner complained of crushing debt. “people have talked about suffering,” mr. juppé told a roomful in the tiny village of st. ’ordon, “and it is true,” he said, speaking in a knowing, weary tone, careful never to exaggerate. with his eyebrows slightly arched, he listened patiently to the complaints. rural france feels “abandoned” and “disdained” by paris, mr. juppé said. “but we can’t accept this gulf between the big cities and rural france. ” promising a “strong state,” he had a warning for his audience deep in the burgundian countryside at st. : “the world is becoming more and more dangerous. nationalism is on the rise. ” similarly, at a rally this week in northern paris, the perceived menace of rising populism was a common theme in the speeches and comments of mr. juppé’s supporters. from mr. juppé himself and the other speakers who preceded him, mr. trump’s name came up often. each time, it was met with loud boos from the crowd of around 6, 000. mr. juppé — “a man of culture,” one speaker called him — was depicted as the antithesis of mr. trump. “after the election of donald trump, after brexit, will populism triumph in our country? no!” shouted patrick devedjian, a former minister, who introduced mr. juppé at the rally. the crowd — mostly or older, and carefully dressed, like mr. juppé — roared approval. “we’ve had it up to here with populist baseness!” mr. devedjian said. another supporter, lagarde, a prominent centrist politician, told the crowd, “france doesn’t need a in the élysée!” — referring to the presidential palace in paris. valérie pécresse, president of the paris region’s council, was equally scathing. “populism is about not telling the truth,” she said. “alain,” she added, turning to mr. juppé, seated in the front row, “you are the antidote to populism. ” mr. juppé, who spoke in pithy bullet points, promised to stand up to enemies and rivals — both internal and external. in a brisk speech that reflected his classical education at france’s top schools, he brought up mr. trump in the context of threats to france. “i don’t know what donald trump’s foreign policy will be,” he told the crowd. “he has said contradictory things. what i know is, there will be an aggressive commercial policy. so we must be aggressive, too. ” setting himself up as a defender of european unity — ms. le pen is fiercely opposed to the european union — mr. juppé said: “france can be a world power, in thrall to nobody. but separated, we will be vassals of the big empires all around us: russia, china and the u. s. ” afterward, encountered on the boulevard outside the rally, he wondered whether his comments about mr. trump had been too “offensive. ” mr. juppé has served twice as france’s foreign minister and chooses his words carefully. but then he shrugged his shoulders, saying about mr. trump, “we’ll see. ”",0,16,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,8.353333333333339,14.0,0.0,0.0
determined to kill: can tough gun laws end mass shootings?,"the flag at desert hot springs' condor gun shop flew at half-staff on friday morning. less than two days had passed since two shooters, armed with four guns, killed 14 people and wounded 21 more at an office holiday party in san bernardino. the shooting, which the fbi is investigating as an ""act of terrorism,"" forced the nation's attention to the city 40 miles west of desert hot springs. it also prompted a flood of calls to condor gun shop, an unheated cabin across from a swath of open desert at the edge of the city. ""since (wednesday), my phone has been ringing off the hook,"" said torrey harris, whose family has owned the shop since 1971. ""it didn't stop ringing until 11:30 at night."" harris said that, after most mass shootings, longtime gun owners seek to stock up on weapons and ammunition that they think california will try to ban in reaction to the incidents of violence. the state legislature often passes a slew of gun control laws in the months after these tragedies. but harris said the response she saw after san bernardino was different. ""i would say a good 40% of my calls (wednesday) were people who have never owned a firearm in their life,"" harris said. gun control activists already say wednesday's shooting demonstrates the need for background checks for ammunition sales. but even california's gun control laws, among the strictest in the nation, haven't prevented seven mass shootings using legally purchased guns since 2006. gun rights advocates maintain that laws don't affect criminals and only make it more difficult for people to protect themselves. harris believes some of those people calling her shop have adopted a similar position. ""they looked at (san bernardino) and said, 'you know what, we have to be able to fight back, and i'm not going to be the person cowering in the corner of a room waiting to be shot,'"" she said. data on mass shootings is sparse, and even the definition of ""mass shooting"" varies widely. the fbi, for instance, defines the events as incidents where at least four people are killed, while a popular online ""shooting tracker"" states that a mass shooting occurs when at least four people, including the shooter, are injured by gunshots. by the fbi's definition, as counted by usa today, there have been 22 mass shootings this year; by the shooting tracker's analysis, san bernardino was number 353 and one of two mass shootings that day. despite this variance, experts don't believe mass shootings are happening more often than they did in past decades. in california and across the country, violent crimes with firearms have declined significantly since the 1980s. at the same time, however, we've become more afraid. ""it was sandy hook that really got people's attention and started this intense focus on (shootings),"" said james alan fox, a northeastern university criminologist who's written several books on mass murder, referring to the 2012 shooting at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, conn. since then, he said, ""even though the incidence hasn't increased, fear has."" a 2015 congressional research service report on mass public shootings found that 2012 was a particularly brutal year — seven mass public shootings, compared to an average of four per year — and suggested that the horrific year had a lasting impact on public opinion. ""several such mass murders in 2012, seven incidents by most counts, compounded a fear among many people that, 'this could happen to me',"" the authors of the report wrote. after the december 2012 shooting at sandy hook, support for controls on gun ownership spiked to 51% of the u.s. population —its highest level in five years, according to the pew research center. support for laws protecting the right to own guns fell from 49% to 42%. polls showed a return to pre-sandy hook opinion levels about six months later. but in comparison, a shooting that killed six people at a 2011 rally for ariz. rep. gabrielle giffords didn't significantly impact public opinion on gun control, according to a poll conducted in the following days by the pew research center. neither did a 2007 shooting at virginia tech that killed 32 people. for some, that fear has resulted in a new desire to bear arms. pew data suggests that, in 1999, nearly half of gun owners bought them for hunting, compared to 26% for personal protection. by feb. 2013, those positions had almost reversed: nearly half of gun owners wanted weapons for personal protection, compared to 32% for hunting. condor gun shop owner harris said, in the last five years, she's begun selling firearms to more women and first-time buyers. during the last 10 years, the national shooting sports foundation, the trade group for firearms manufacturers, has also seen a steady increase in first-time and female gun owners. about 25 to 30% of customers are first-time gun buyers, who often purchase a gun for protection. more than 30% of customers are women, nssf spokesman mike bazinet said. harris said she's started asking first-time gun owners what changed their minds about purchasing a firearm. more and more people tell her that they want to be responsible for their own safety. ""just like buying car insurance, you go out and you buy it and you hope you never have to use it, but you're really thankful if you ever get into an accident. and a lot of people who buy these firearms do the same thing,"" harris said. ""it really has changed, the whole mindset of a lot of people who are buying guns now."" but, according to san bernardino police, syed rizwan farook — one of the san bernardino shooters — purchased his two guns legally from a federal licensed firearms dealer. another person bought two .223-caliber rifles —a dpms a-15 and smith & wesson m&p15 — legally. only the shooters' modification attempts to the assault weapons, to make one rifle accept 30-round magazines and one rifle fully automatic, made them illegal to possess. so for gun control advocates, mass shootings are sirens, calling for further limits on access to guns. in the wake of the sandy hook shooting, for example, the california state legislature passed at least 14 bills tightening restrictions on gun ownership — more gun laws than it had passed in the previous six years combined. gov. jerry brown signed laws banning conversion kits for ammunition magazines, toughening mental health reporting requirements and closing a ""loophole"" that allowed single-shot handguns to bypass safety requirements. in 2014, a bill cited a shooting in isla vista — when a gunman shot and killed three people and fatally stabbed three others near the university of california santa barbara campus — as the reason for its necessity. that measure, now a law, allows judges to temporarily keep people from purchasing or possessing guns if family members or law enforcement think they might harm themselves or others. while nearly 40 states have relaxed gun rules in the last two decades, california has enacted more than 50 major gun bills since 1994. the pro-gun control law center to prevent gun violence, based in san francisco, gave california's laws an a- in 2014, the highest grade given to any state. guns & ammo magazine, with a pro-gun rights stance, ranked the state fourth-worst in the country for gun ownership. already, in the wake of the san bernardino tragedy, gun control advocates are touting a 2016 ballot initiative that lt. gov. gavin newsom proposed in october. the measure proposes background checks for ammunition purchases and bans possession of high capacity magazines. ""ammunition is what makes a firearm into a deadly weapon, and we should have background checks on firearms and ammunition,"" law center staff attorney ari freilich said. ""these individuals, it looks like they stockpiled 3,000 to 4,000 rounds of ammunition. they did it without having to show id, without having to pass a background check."" prior to san bernardino, california had seen seven public shootings since 2006 that claimed four or more lives (not counting those police believe were gang-related), according to usa today's ""behind the bloodshed"" tracker. in four of those shootings, the weapons shooters used were purchased legally and registered to the shooters. in two other incidents, the guns were purchased legally but registered to other people. in only one incident, the 2013 rampage near santa monica college, did law enforcement say that the weapons used were illegal in california. ""here (in california), as pretty much everywhere in the country, anybody who isn't disqualified by virtue of them having a felony conviction can get a gun, and can get a bunch of guns, and can get guns that are quite deadly, because guns are deadly,"" said eugene volokh, a professor of constitutional law at ucla and writer for ""the volokh conspiracy,"" a legal blog hosted by the washington post. freilich believes mass shootings with guns that have been purchased legally, like wednesday's in san bernardino, emphasize the need for more stringent gun control. ""i do think (san bernardino) highlights to legislators and to the california public that despite all that we've done — california has the toughest gun laws in the nation — more clearly needs to be done,"" freilich said. since the late 1980s, the crime rate has dropped in california and nationally by about 50%, according to the california attorney general's office and the fbi. gun control advocates attribute that drop in california in part to gun control laws. however, some researchers, including volokh, doubt that conclusion— pointing out that violence has dropped nationwide even though most states have loosened gun control laws and california is widely known to have the strictest laws in the nation. the percentage of homicide victims killed by firearms has remained steady in california since 1990, according to the california attorney general's homicide report. realistically, the battle to prevent mass tragedies with legislation may be futile, volokh said. ""let's look at somebody who is a would-be mass shooter. this person has essentially decided to have the defining event of his life, and possibly the concluding event of his life, be mass murder,"" volokh said. ""this is somebody who is very motivated to commit the crime, and again, we know he is motivated because he's willing to give up his life to do that."" wednesday's shooting was perpetrated by people determined to kill, volokh said. the shooters, syed rizwan farook and tashfeen malik, have been identified as husband and wife, and investigators found a dozen pipe bombs and more than 4,500 rounds of ammunition in the home they were renting in redlands. the fbi is investigating the mass shooting as an 'act of terrorism.' while gun control may help reduce violence in general, criminologist james alan fox doesn't think legislation will help prevent mass shootings like these. ""gun control can do a lot in terms of impacting the kind of gun crime you see every day. will it avert mass killings? not really,"" fox said. ""they'll find a way to get a gun. if they can't get one legally, which most of them can, they'll borrow one, steal one — but they'll get one."" for torrey harris of condor gun shop, this tragic conversation is becoming routine. ""i've gone through this so many times now, i know how the cycle goes,"" harris said. ""there are going to be people who are yelling and screaming for more gun laws and people who are going to be yelling and screaming for less, and unfortunately, probably nothing is going to happen, which i think frustrates both sides."" on friday, it was business as usual at harris' gun shop. a customer walked in the door, hoping to buy a handgun. harris began the legal steps of selling a gun in california, asking the customer for identification, proof of residency and his firearm safety certificate. now, he'll have to submit to a background check. in 10 days, he can pick up his gun. the process of purchasing a gun in california •obtain a firearm safety certificate by passing a knowledge test. the test, made up of 30 true-false and multiple-choice questions, is drawn from a 46-page study guide available online. copies of the test are available in english and spanish. •present the firearm safety certificate, a california id or driver's license and a utility bill or car registration with your current address to a licensed firearms dealer. •choose your firearm. according to the california department of justice, there are currently 822 handgun models approved for sale in the state. long guns are subject to individual regulations rather than a pre-approved list. •get a handling demonstration from the seller, including how to load, unload and lock the gun. the seller and buyer must both sign an affidavit saying the demonstration occurred. •pay for the gun and keep your receipt. •return in 10 days to pick up the gun, provided you passed the background check. •at this time, buy a gun lock or show a receipt to show that you bought one in the last 30 days.",0,10,0.0,0,1,0,0.0,3.650000000000002,8.0,0.0,0.0

russians steal research on trump in hack of u.s. democratic party,"washington (reuters) - hackers believed to be working for the russian government broke into the democratic national committee’s computer network, spied on internal communications and accessed research on presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump, the committee and security experts said on tuesday. two separate groups entered the dnc’s system, and one read email and chat communications for nearly a year before being detected, according to the committee and crowdstrike, the cyber firm that helped clean up the breach. russian spies also targeted the networks of trump and democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, as well as the computers of some republican political action committees, the washington post quoted u.s. officials as saying, although details were not available. a clinton campaign official said there was no evidence the campaign’s information systems had been hacked. a russian government spokesman denied involvement in the breach. “i completely rule out a possibility that the (russian) government or the government bodies have been involved in this,” dmitry peskov, a kremlin spokesman, told reuters in moscow. the intrusion is emblematic of the sophistication of russian hackers, who intelligence officials have long viewed as the most talented of u.s. adversaries in cyberspace. the democratic party had been aware of efforts to hack trump material for two months, and u.s. intelligence agencies were involved in efforts to find out who was behind the hacking, a source familiar with trump opposition research said. the source said democratic party operatives believed the hacking was conducted by the russian government. the research includes material on trump’s business efforts in azerbaijan, georgia, serbia and russia, according to information made available to reuters. cyber attacks against political candidates and organizations are common worldwide. u.s. national intelligence director james clapper said last month he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the nov. 8 presidential election nears. u.s. representative jim langevin, a democrat and co-founder of the congressional cybersecurity caucus, said it was “disconcerting” that independent groups penetrated the dnc and that one was able “to stay embedded for nearly a year.” but the groups are extremely sophisticated, langevin said, and have previously been implicated on attacks at the white house, the state department and the german bundestag, as well as a number of private companies. the dnc contacted crowdstrike in may and within 24 hours it began investigating unusual activity on the group’s network, said dmitri alperovitch, the company’s co-founder and chief technology officer. it identified two hacking groups and both were kicked out this weekend, he said. the first, which crowdstrike named cozy bear, entered the dnc’s systems last summer, according to the firm. it primarily monitored email and chat conversations and may be working for russia’s federal security service, or fsb, alperovitch said. russian president vladimir putin once ran the fsb. the second group, nicknamed fancy bear, is probably working on behalf of russia’s military, alperovitch said. it gained entry in late april and “went straight to the oppo research ... on donald trump and exfiltrated some of it,” he said. alperovitch said both groups were among “the best threat actors that we’ve ever encountered” but they did not appear to be working together. he was not sure how the intrusions occurred but suspected the hackers may have leveraged “spearphishing” emails to trick dnc employees into downloading malicious code onto their network. “when we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is,” rep. debbie wasserman schultz, chairwoman of the dnc, said in a statement. “our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.” trump’s interest in russia goes back to the 1980s, with a 1990 vanity fair article citing news program appearances in which trump offered his own services as a negotiator with russia. information made available to reuters indicates trump tried on at least three occasions - in 2004, 2008 and 2013 - to get involved in business deals in russia. in 2013, he and an azerbaijani-russian oligarch, aras agalarov, jointly put on a miss universe competition in moscow, and trump was photographed with agalarov’s wife, son and daughter. the last two u.s. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting president barack obama’s campaign and the campaigns of his republican foes. u.s. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to chinese hackers.",0,11,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,6.936363636363637,8.036363636363637,0.0,0.0
watch: giuliani demands that democrats apologize for trump’s racist birtherism,"you know, because in fantasyland republicans never questioned the citizenship of america s first black president.but that s exactly what they did for years and donald trump led the charge by going on or calling into fox news every chance he could in order to demand president obama s birth certificate.it was trump who constantly claimed president obama was born in kenya even though hawaii newspapers from the time announce obama s birth.trump and his birther fans were finally utterly humiliated when president obama released his birth certificate to the public.and now that birtherism is coming back to bite trump on the ass as he tries to convince black voters that he isn t a racist.part of the reason why black voters reject trump is because he questioned the citizenship of president obama simply because he is black. but trump wants everyone to pretend he didn t say any nasty things about president obama and trump pawn rudy giuliani is demanding that democrats apologize for trump s birtherism.giuliani, who has taken to forgetting about 9/11 recently, appeared on cnn with jake tapper on sunday and was grilled because trump has not apologized for his birtherism. many african-americans say they are still troubled by mr. trump having suggested over and over, falsely, that the first african-american president was born in africa and thus ineligible to be president tapper began.giuliani immediately blamed hillary clinton for starting the birther conspiracy, but tapper quickly fact-checked giuliani, which forced him to blame clinton s campaign instead.giuliani then attempted to portray trump as a hero for resolving the conspiracy, claiming that black people have a faulty memory. he literally thinks black people should thank trump for being a birther.but tapper was quick to remind giuliani that it was president obama who resolved the conspiracy by releasing his birth certificate in 2011 while trump was still pushing his birtherism four years later in february 2015 when he told cpac that he thinks the birth certificate is fake. so apparently trump thinks it hasn t been resolved, thus blowing giuliani s claim out of the water. should he just apologize for this if he really wants to reach out to minority voters? tapper asked.giuliani replied by demanding that democrats apologize for calling trump s birtherism racist and went on to bash president obama. if everybody apologized for all the things they said in politics, all we would be doing on television shows is apologizing. maybe all the democrats should apologize for calling donald trump a racist and calling him all kinds of terrible names and it gets a little silly. food stamps have gone up two and a half times under barack obama, he added. he should be ashamed of himself. jobs should have gone up two and a half times. my only point is that many african-americans are still mad about donald trump having tried to invalidate barack obama by claiming he was born in africa, tapper responded before giving up and moving on.here s the video via youtube:giuliani seems to be forgetting that the recession that began under george w. bush and the republicans in 2008 caused more families to need food stamps in the first place, which is why the number of people on food stamps has gone up. also, president obama has set a record for the most consecutive months of jobs created and is actually one of the best job-creating presidents over the last 40 years.once again, giuliani gets caught talking out of his ass and he must be truly desperate if he is resorting to demanding an apology from democrats for trump s racism.featured image: screenshot",1,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,11.91,16.0,0.0,0.0
migrants refuse to leave train at refugee camp in hungary,"migrants refuse to leave train at refugee camp in hungary thousands of migrants flooded into a train station in the hungarian capital thursday after police lifted a two-day blockade, but some who boarded a train they thought was going to germany ended up instead at a refugee camp just miles from budapest. the associated press reports that ""excited migrants piled into a newly arrived train at the keleti station in hungary's capital despite announcements in hungarian and english that all services from the station to western europe had been canceled. a statement on the main departures board said no more trains to austria or germany would depart 'due to safety reasons until further notice!' ""many migrants, who couldn't understand either language and were receiving no advice from hungarian officials, scrambled aboard in a standing-room-only crush and hoped for the best,"" the ap said. scuffles broke out when police ordered the passengers off the train at bicske, according to the bbc. meanwhile, hungary's prime minister says his country is doing all it can to manage a growing migrant crisis, even as european officials said they will meet this month in brussels to discuss an effort to ""strengthen the european response"" to the situation. viktor orban said the influx of refugees into his country is really ""a german problem"" because that is the intended destination for most of them. hungarians, along with other europeans, are ""full of fear"" he says, because ""they see that the european leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation."" ""if we would create an image ... just come because we are ready to accept everybody, that would be a moral failure, because that is not the case,"" orban said after a meeting with european parliament president martin schulz, according to the washington post.

trump tussle gives unpopular mexican leader much-needed shot in arm,"mexico city (reuters) - donald trump’s combative style has buffeted mexico’s president for months, but deeply unpopular enrique pena nieto may end up thanking the new u.s. president for prompting offended mexicans to rally behind their leader. from billionaire business magnate carlos slim to political opponents, there has been a groundswell of support for pena nieto, who has cut a lonely figure in months of bruising encounters with trump. often referred to by his initials epn, pena nieto is laboring under the worst approval ratings of any mexican president in decades due to discontent over corruption, gang violence, sluggish growth and a jump in fuel prices. trump’s threats to scrap the nafta trade deal with mexico and build a border wall have caused anger and left mexicans feeling fearful for the future. his challenge to pena nieto on thursday - saying he should skip a planned summit between the two leaders if mexico wasn’t willing to pay for the wall - was the final straw. pena nieto replied a couple of hours later that he had canceled his meeting with trump, one of the president’s biggest ever hits on twitter, getting more “likes” than when he personally broke news of the capture of notorious drug lord joaquin “el chapo” guzman in january of last year. “bravo epn!,” cheered former president vicente fox, who had initially condemned pena nieto for inviting trump to mexico for talks last august, and who has waged a colorful and expletive-ridden campaign against the republican on twitter. pena nieto and trump talked for about an hour by phone on friday, pledging to work out their differences and agreeing not to speak about the wall in public for now. meanwhile, calls for unity grew in mexico, led by slim, a normally media-shy 76-year-old who gave a 90-minute news conference in support of the government on friday. “this is the most surprising example of national unity i’ve seen in my life,” said slim, who spent several years in the past decade as the world’s richest man. “we have to back the president of mexico so he can defend our national interests.” senior opposition leaders also urged a common front. “it’s time to show unity and our commitment to mexico,” alejandra barrales, head of the center-left party of the democratic revolution (prd), said on twitter. pena nieto’s credibility has been battered by a widespread public perception that he has failed to battle corruption and indeed even encouraged it since a conflict-of-interest row embroiled him, his wife and a top minister in late 2014. some opposition critics fear the government will try to use trump as a screen to distract from its failings. however, two senior officials told reuters they hoped pena nieto would seize the moment to act quickly and decisively to improve his image. expressions of dismay at trump’s behavior towards mexico have almost become a national pastime, and talk of boycotts against u.s. companies is gathering steam on social media. slim, when asked about boycotting at his news conference, said it wasn’t a good idea to turn on u.s. companies, which are creating jobs in mexico. some foreign companies voiced support for mexico too. “i feel mexico is being subjected to terror at the moment,” said andreas schindler, co-owner of german fruit wholesaler don limon’s parent pilz schindler, by phone from hamburg. “we’re right behind mexico.”",0,10,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,10.73,16.0,0.0,0.0
goldman sachs endorses hillary clinton for president,"goldman sachs endorses hillary clinton for president for goldman sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? | october 27, 2016 be sociable, share! lloyd blankfein, ceo of goldman sachs, is greeted by hillary clinton at a panel discussion at the clinton global initiative, sept. 24, 2014 in new york. published in partnership with shadowproof . he’s with her. on sunday, former secretary of state hillary clinton earned the endorsement of goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein —an endorsement she had been working toward for years. as was revealed by wikileaks, hillary clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to goldman sachs and other wall street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. on october 24, 2013, clinton told goldman sachs that dodd-frank had to be done mostly for “political reasons” because congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. she said, “there’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. how do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? and the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.” yes, she essentially endorsed wall street writing the rules because wall street knows its business best and complained to goldman sachs that regulations had frightened bankers. “i mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they’re scared of regulations, they’re scared of the other shoe dropping, they’re just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth,” clinton said. “so people are, you know, a little — they’re still uncertain, and they’re uncertain both because they don’t know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they’re also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we’re only beginning to take hold of.” music to wall street’s ears. for goldman sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? after all, they did pay hillary clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. despite her private comments to goldman sachs, hillary clinton has taken a tough public position on wall street during the campaign, likely due to senator bernie sanders’ success in the primaries. of course, wikileaks also revealed that clinton told the national multi-housing council in a private speech that “you need both a public and a private position.” so the real question is, what do blankfein and goldman want in return and what is clinton’s private position on giving it to them? be sociable, share!",1,7,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,12.425714285714289,19.942857142857143,0.0,0.0
